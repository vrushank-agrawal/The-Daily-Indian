        "description": "The growing frenzy of paparazzi culture in Bollywood is increasingly becoming a concern for celebrities. Many stars, including Janhvi Kapoor, have expressed frustration over the constant attention they receive. Several actors have stated that they do not inform the paparazzi about their whereabouts, yet they often find photographers waiting for them at locations where they are not allowed. Janhvi Kapoor has frequently mentioned in interviews that she never invites photographers to click her outside the gym or in other casual settings, apart from airports and film promotion events. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Varinder Chawla (@vbollywood_official) Recently, Janhvi was seen during promotions for her upcoming film \"Devara,\" but the actress appeared displeased with the paparazzi\u2019s behavior. The photographers were seen pushing each other in an attempt to capture her, which visibly left Janhvi annoyed. Although she calmly allowed the paparazzi to take pictures as she walked to her vanity van, the chaos caused by the photographers led her to express her frustration. She reportedly asked them not to push one another before entering her van without posing further.

However, the situation remained chaotic due to the intense behavior of the photographers. Janhvi Kapoor is making her debut in the South Indian film industry with \"Devara,\" starring alongside Jr. NTR from \"RRR.\" Dressed in a turquoise outfit with intricate pearlwork, Janhvi looked stunning. Her beauty and popularity often make her a prime target for paparazzi eager to capture her in their lenses.",

        "description": "The Jammu and Kashmir Police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) after a female Flying Officer accused a Wing Commander of the Air Force Station in Srinagar of sexual assault. The FIR has been lodged against the Wing Commander at the Budgam Police Station under Section 376(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, which deals with aggravated rape by persons in positions of authority.The female Flying Officer alleged that the Wing Commander sexually assaulted her in his room during a New Year's party held at the Officers' Mess on December 31, 2023. She recounted the events of the night, stating that the assault occurred at around 2:00 AM on January 1, 2024, after Wing Commander allegedly took her to his room under the guise of giving her a gift. Once there, the Wing Commander allegedly molested her. \"I repeatedly asked him to stop and tried to resist in all ways possible. Finally, I pushed him and ran away,\" she stated.Following the incident, she said she was in shock and unsure of how to proceed, fearing further repercussions if she reported the crime. \"I was afraid and didn't know what to do as there were instances before where I was discouraged from reporting. He visited my office after the incident, behaving as if nothing happened, without any sign of remorse,\" she recounted.She confided in two other female officers, who advised her to file a formal complaint.The Flying Officer further narrated her struggles to submit a complaint and alleged mishandling of the investigation by the Internal Committee. Following her complaint, a Colonel-rank officer was assigned to investigate. She claimed that the accused Wing Commander was made to sit with her twice in January to record statements in violation of standard protocols. She said she objected to his presence, and the investigation was later closed, allegedly to \"hide mistakes of the administration.\"The Flying Officer then filed a fresh application to the internal committee, which convened two months later. \"The internal committee did not perform its duties properly, as directions had come from higher authorities to keep the results neutral. Everyone was aiding the sexual offender,\" she alleged.Despite her insistence, no medical examination was conducted until much later, the victim claimed.Her requests for interim relief, leave, or a different posting for either herself or the Wing Commander were allegedly denied. \"I am forced to socialise with these people and attend events with my abuser,\" she claimed in her complaint.The internal committee ultimately deemed the case inconclusive due to the lack of eyewitnesses and closed its investigation in May. \"Isn't it common sense that someone would not commit sexual assault in front of a witness?\" she questioned.The Flying Officer has also reported \"continuous mental harassment\" and \"social boycott,\" with her personal communications being unofficially monitored. \"The individuals I speak with are harassed by the authorities,\" she said.The female offer stated that the harassment severely affected her mental health, leading her to experience suicidal thoughts. \"I am living in constant fear, under 24/7 scrutiny, and my social life has been completely disrupted. The harassment has driven me to suicidal thoughts, and I feel utterly helpless. I am unable to carry on with my daily life, and my social interactions are closely monitored and discouraged by authorities. I have endured this torture for too long, and I am at my breaking point,\" she expressed in her complaint.She has urged the police to take immediate action and ensure that justice is served, naming several senior officers as complicit in her harassment.ALSO READ | 'Justice Hema Committee Formed As Left Is In Power': Kerala CM Responds After HC Raps 'Inaction'IAF Says Cooperating With Probe Into CaseThe Indian Air Force has acknowledged the case and confirmed its cooperation with local authorities. \"We are aware of the case.

        "description": "Fixed deposits (FDs) have long been a popular choice amongst investors for offering assured returns and safety from market volatility. Among the different types of FDs available today, compounding FDs are an attractive option that offers higher returns with the power of compound interest. Let\u2019s understand how they work and what benefits they offer to investors looking to grow their investments.How Does a Compounding FD Work?In the case of a compounding fixed deposit, the interest earned is periodically added to the principal instead of being paid out, which is known as the compounding effect. The interest typically compounds on a quarterly or annual basis. Over time, you earn interest not only on the original principal but also on interest accumulated from the past. As a result, your investment grows faster as compared to a simple interest FD, where interest is calculated solely on the initial principal.For instance, you invest Rs 1,00,000 in a compounding FD with a 7 per cent interest rate, compounded quarterly. Interest for the first quarter will be calculated on the initial deposit of Rs 1,00,000. In the next quarter, interest will be calculated on Rs 1,01,750 (principal plus interest from the first quarter), and this process continues. With compounding, your investment can grow exponentially, especially over a longer tenure as interest is earned on both the principal and accumulated interest.Benefits of Compounding FDsHigher returns: One of key advantages of a compounding FD is the potential for higher returns due to compound interest. It allows you the chance to grow your savings faster than a simple interest FD would.Safety and stability: Fixed deposits are one of the safest investment options available. Offering guaranteed returns and zero market risk, they are ideal for conservative investors or those looking to balance their portfolio.Flexible tenures: Compounding FDs are available for a variety of tenures, allowing you to choose a tenure that aligns with your short-term or long-term financial goals.Reinvestment opportunities: At the end of your FD tenure, you can reinvest the maturity amount in another compounding FD, further boosting your wealth-building efforts.Tax ImplicationsThe interest earned on fixed deposits is considered taxable income under the Income Tax Act. It is added to your total income and taxed according to your applicable income tax slab rate. However, FDs with a 5-year lock-in period qualify for tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The amount invested in such FDs is eligible for a deduction up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum. But the interest earned on these FDs is still taxable.If you withdraw the FD before its maturity, banks usually impose a penalty, such as lowering the interest rate of the FD. The tax treatment remains the same, with TDS deducted as applicable. When filing your taxes, remember to declare the interest income from FDs under \u2018Income from Other Sources.\u2019 Also ensure that the TDS deducted by the bank is accounted for when filing your returns. If TDS has been deducted but your total taxable income falls below the taxable threshold, you can claim a refund for the excess TDS paid.Compounding FDs are a powerful investment tool that can boost your returns by leveraging the benefits of compound interest. The key lies in understanding how it works so you can choose the right FD to meet your short or long-term goals. The author is the AGM Communication at Bankbazaar.com.

        "description": "India\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow at 6.7 per cent in the 2024-25 fiscal year (FY25) on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, the latest report by Nomura revealed. The brokerage\u2019s estimate places India\u2019s economic growth 50 basis points (bps) lower than the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI\u2019s) expectations for the current fiscal year. The RBI earlier gave a GDP growth estimate of 7.2 per cent for FY25. The analysts at the brokerage noted that they expect a downside risk to the growth projections of 7.2 per cent for the 2025-26 financial year (FY26), reported Moneycontrol.The report tracked the growth in auto sales, including passenger vehicles (PVs), and medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs), and found that the figures for July and August both were \u2018disappointing\u2019.\u201cGrowth signals are currently mixed. Catch-up in government spending and rural demand are positives, but softness in consumer discretionary demand, industrial demand and external demand are negatives,\u201d the report noted.Also Read : PAN Card-Based KYC: Online & Offline Methods To Required Documents; Everything You Need to Know\u201cTo gauge cyclical growth, we have found that sales of passenger vehicles (PV) and medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) are important. PVs signal discretionary consumer demand, while MHCV sales have a high beta to overall industrial activity,\u201d the report added. The brokerage analysed the vehicle sales to oversee cyclical growth and highlighted that the statistics showed a slump. Nomura further stated that the net GDP growth is set to dampen to 6.7 per cent on a YoY basis in FY25, slipping below the RBI\u2019s projection of 7.2 per cent. \"PV and MHCV sales both disappointed in July and August. Wholesale PV sales growth fell to -2.0 per cent YoY in July and -2.5 per cent in August, while MHCV sales growth declined to -7.1 per cent and -10.7 per cent, respectively. Inventories for PVs have risen from 55-60 days in May to 70-75 days in August, with hopes now pinned on the festive season,\" the brokerage noted.",

The protest, which started on August 9, followed the discovery of the victim\u2019s body in the seminar room of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Despite the Supreme Court's request for the protesting doctors to resume work by the given deadline, the junior doctors remain firm in their decision to continue the \"cease work\" protest until their demands are addressed. One of the primary demands includes the removal of senior officials, including the Kolkata Police Commissioner, the Health Secretary, the Director of Health Services, and the Director of Medical Education. Justice for RG Kar banners surface during India's heartbreaking 0-3 Intercontinental Cup loss to Syria (WATCH) One of the protesting doctors stated, \"We will not return to work until our demands are met. The state government was expected to remove the named officials by 5 PM, but no action has been taken, so the protest continues. However, we are open to dialogue.\" On Monday, the Supreme Court urged the doctors to return to their duties, ensuring that no adverse actions, such as punitive transfers, would be taken against them. This assurance came after the West Bengal government confirmed that no disciplinary action would be enforced if the doctors resumed work. The protests have drawn significant attention, as the junior doctors are determined to continue their strike until their demands are fully addressed. They seek accountability and justice for the deceased trainee doctor and have called for stronger action from the authorities. Kolkata rape-murder horror: 'CM is lying...' Victim's mother accuses Mamata of lying about compensation offer The cease-work movement, which began on August 9, has now entered a critical phase as the healthcare sector in Kolkata remains crippled, with junior doctors standing firm in their demand for change.
