Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India is poised to step in around the crucial 84-mark, likely deploying its reserves to prevent a further slide in the rupee,\" said, Amit",

Menstruation is a natural, biological process, but for many women, it is surrounded by myths, shame, and lack of support. Matri, a revolutionary startup, is not only providing an effective solution to period pain with Matri's Period Pain Relief Device, but also challenging and dismantling the deeply ingrained taboos surrounding menstruation in India.",

This initiative represents a significant leap towards low emission steel production. In the first phase, Jindal Renewables will develop a green hydrogen generation capacity of up to 4,500 tons per annum set to commence by December 2025. In addition, the project will also entail supply of 36,000 tons of oxygen per annum that will be used in the Angul steelworks. JRPL will also be supplying ~3GW of renewable energy to JSPL's facilities reducing the steelmaker's dependence on coal fired energy by 50% in the next 2-3years. This integration of green energy is expected to drastically lower the company's carbon footprint.",
