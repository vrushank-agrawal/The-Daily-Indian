            "content": "The central highlight of PM Modi\u2019s visit will be his participation in the Quad leaders' summit on September 21, taking place in Wilmington, Delaware. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit the United States from September 21 to 23, as announced by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Tuesday. His trip will include key meetings, addressing the Indian diaspora, and participation in the Quad summit as well as the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Here\u2019s a breakdown of his itinerary. September 21: Quad Leaders\u2019 Summit The central highlight of PM Modi\u2019s visit will be his participation in the Quad leaders' summit on September 21, taking place in Wilmington, Delaware. This summit will be hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden, marking the first time Biden has hosted foreign leaders in his hometown as president. The significance of this gathering is amplified as it is likely to be one of Biden\u2019s last major international engagements before the U.S. elects a new president, with India set to host the next Quad summit in 2025. The summit will bring together the heads of the four key Quad nations: Japan, Australia, India, and the United States. The discussions will focus on reviewing the progress made over the past year and shaping the agenda to support the development goals of Indo-Pacific countries. The Quad's influence in the region and its role in promoting stability and cooperation will be key topics of conversation. September 22: \u2018Modi & US Progress Together\u2019 Event in New York On September 22, PM Modi will travel to New York to address a major gathering of the Indian diaspora at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The event, titled \"Modi & US Progress Together,\" has garnered significant interest, with over 24,000 members of the Indian community expected to attend. The event aims to celebrate the growing ties between India and the U.S., focusing on the collaborative progress made in various sectors. During his time in New York, PM Modi will also meet with CEOs from leading U.S. companies. These discussions will emphasize fostering deeper collaboration in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, semiconductors, and biotechnology. This interaction aligns with India's push toward technological advancement and innovation, further strengthening India-U.S. economic partnerships. September 23: Summit of the Future\u2019 at UNGA On September 23, Prime Minister Modi will deliver an address at the \"Summit of the Future\" during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. The theme for this year's summit is \"Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow,\" reflecting a focus on global cooperation to address future challenges. World leaders from across the globe are expected to attend the summit, making it a significant diplomatic event. On the sidelines of the summit, PM Modi is scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with several global leaders to discuss various issues of mutual interest, further enhancing India's position on the international stage.",

            "description": "CBI, NIA, the Railway Police and the Home Ministry to come up with a scheme to prevent sabotage of tracks",
            "content": "Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) that several agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Railway Police and the Home Ministry are preparing a scheme for the protection of the railway network to ensure that there is no sabotage. He also said the Census exercise would begin soon. When asked if caste would be enumerated with the next Census, Mr. Shah said, \u201cEverything will be in the public domain.\u201d He said the Waqf (Amendment) Bill is committed to the management and preservation of Waqf properties and would be passed in Parliament in the coming days. Mr. Shah stated that any conspiracy to cause railway accidents would not last long and the government would soon unveil an initiative for the protection of railway network of 1.10 lakh km across the country. The Home Minister\u2019s remarks come in the wake of a series of incidents indicating sabotage as obstructions were placed on railway tracks. Addressing a press conference to mark 100 days of the third tenure of the BJP-led NDA government, Mr. Shah said he had discussed the issue of railway safety with Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw over the last two days. \u201cAs far as accidents are concerned, we will investigate the root cause of this. Whatever the reason, the government is committed to addressing the issue. If this is a conspiracy, it will not last long. If there are gaps, they will be plugged,\u201d Mr. Shah said. The Congress party had claimed that there were 38 railway accidents in the first 100 days of the third tenure of the Modi government and accused Mr. Vaishnaw of dismissing these as \u201cminor incidents\u201d.

            "content": "Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, Mysuru MP, met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in New Delhi and urged her for the continuation of GST exemption on black pepper. The MP said he met the Finance Minister and discussed the GST exemption for black pepper, a crucial concern for farmers in Kodagu, Hassan, and Chikkamagaluru districts. \u201cI requested continuation of exemption, highlighting its classification as agricultural produce and potential negative impact on farmers and exports if GST was imposed. I am thankful for the Minister\u2019s positive consideration, which will benefit our farmers,\u201d Mr. Yaduveer said. During his meeting, Mr. Wadiyar told the Finance Minister that the people from his constituency, primarily from Kodagu, brought to his attention the notices they received from the GST office in Mysuru stating that the sale of pepper grown at their plantation is subject to GST and that the planters also need to be registered under the GST Act. \u201cThe GST notice stems from a misunderstanding about the nature of the drying process. The growers said the drying process does not alter the essential characteristics of pepper. It is primarily a preservation technique. The imposition of GST on the products could have significant negative consequences for the plantation districts of Karnataka, including Kodagu, Hassan, and Chikkamagaluru districts, as well as growers in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It could lead to increased costs, reduced profit margins, and potential job losses. Additionally, it could negatively impact exports, reducing India\u2019s competitiveness in the global market,\u201d the MP said, in a memorandum to the Finance Minister. Mr. Wadiyar said that further to drying green pepper at the estate, to enhance its storage capacity, this dried pepper could be given a separate HSN code and exempt from GST applicability. \u201cSince it is an agricultural produce, this would be of great help for farmers and there are already HSN codes available for black and green peppers.\u201d The MP said farmers are looking forward to your continued support for the agriculture community and favourable intervention on the matter.

            "content": "Around 400 elastic rail clips that fasten the railway track with concrete sleepers were found removed near Paramakudi railway station on Monday. Government Railway Police have registered a case of under Section 151 of Railways Act, 1989 for damaging of railway property. Superintendent of Police, GRP, Tiruchi, P. Rajan, who rushed to Madurai, enquired a keyman, Senthilkumar, who was the first to notice the removal of pandrol clips for nearly 130 metres between Sudiyur and Paramakudi railway station. However, the keyman was let off on Tuesday. Earlier, railway employees staged a demonstration protesting against the detention of the keyman by the railway police for the enquiry. The police said that the clips on the inner side of the left track were seen removed and were lying between the tracks. Senthilkumar, who was on patrol duty, noticed the danger and alerted the railway officials. He also stopped the Madurai-Rameswaram passenger train that was about the cross the section. After temporarily restoring the track, the train was allowed to move with caution at a slower speed. The train suffered detention for some five minutes, the police said. Since the clips had been removed within a short time, the police suspected that somone who has the expertise in railway work could have been behind the crime. The police also have a suspicion on the railway contract workers. The police have planned to conduct an enquiry with the locopilots of the trains that had passed through the section since Monday morning. Further investigation is under way.

The farmers apprehend that there is also the risk of groundwater getting contaminated due to the wastes dumped by some of the open-end spinning mills in the region could get mixed in the water at any time. The mills, the farmers have complained, surreptitiously dump the waste packed in sacks during the night hours, citing a dump at Veppampalayam. While urging the officials to intervene, the farmers have also appealed to the mill owners to eschew the practice.

Inaugurating the programme, Capt. Brijesh Chowta, MP, said cleanliness should be part of the daily routine. It is sad to see people, who believe in personal hygiene, not being socially committed to keeping premises and area clean. Capt. Chowta said learning about cleanliness in school and putting the same in practice will be good moral education for students. If students and youth seriously take forward the drive, the country will soon become a clean nation. The MP called upon people and organisations to openly take part in the cleaning drives to be held between September 17 and October 2. On the occasion, three pourakarmikas were felicitated. Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer K. Anandh, Mangaluru City Corporation Commissioner C.L. Anand, Deputy Conservator of Forests (Social Forestry) Roshan Nanaiah, senior environment officer Lakshmikant, and President of Bengre Mahajana Sabha Chetan Bengre took part in the programme. In Udupi, the cleaning drive was held in Malpe. Inaugurating the drive, Udupi Deputy Commissioner K. Vidyakumari said it our duty and responsibility to keep our surroundings clean. If each one of us keep our surroundings clean, then the whole city will be clean. Asking students not to dispose waste in a haphazard manner, the Udupi DC said students should keep their houses and schools clean. The Udupi DC launched the activity by planting few saplings on the premises of Vithoba Bhajana Mandir. Students, officials, and other persons took part in cleaning activity. President of Udupi City Municipal Council Prabhakar Poojary, Udupi Municipal Council Commissioner Rayappa, and Environment Officer K.S. Sneha took part in the programme.

            "content": "What if the holy river Ganga were a woman? She would embody the nurturing spirit of a mother with patience, the romantic allure of a lover, and the devotion of divinity itself. Flowing endlessly, dedicated to the salvation of others, even while enduring the pain of separation\u2014this is the essence of Ganga , a dance performance that enriched the Onam celebrations in Thrissur, symbolising the strength of womanhood. Dancer Marina Antony brought Ganga to the stage at the Regional Theatre of the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi here on Tuesday. Ganga was presented in a classical Bharatanatyam style with simplified gestures and expressions. This approach allowed even those unfamiliar with the intricacies of classical dance to enjoy and understand it easily. The 45-minute dance piece is inspired by the idea that divine beings, though celestial, experience love similarly to human women. The performance was choreographed by dancer R.L.V. Anand and featured lyrics by Rajeev Aalunkal, with music and vocal performances by Guruvayur Bhagyalakshmi. The lighting and stage setup were managed by Murali Thayyil. Ms. Antony is a disciple of Mr. Anand and the late Ravi Master, specialising in folk dance forms. She is currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree in Kuchipudi at Silicon Andhra University.

            "content": "Amidst reports of a decline in the production of raw silk in China, the neighbouring country is trying to import cocoons from India. Disclosing this to reporters in Mysuru on Tuesday, September 17, Member Secretary of Central Silk Board (CSB) P. Sivakumar said China had placed a requirement of 950 metric tonnes of cocoons from India during the last four months. However, India has not allowed the export of raw cocoons to China. \u201cWe are not allowing it as it should not pose a threat to our raw silk industry,\u201d he said before adding that a call in the regard will be taken when any particular State says there is surplus production of cocoons in their State. It may be mentioned here that China, which is the world leader in silk production, has witnessed a rapid decline in raw silk production over the last five years. According to reports, raw silk production in China had declined from 1.7 lakh tonnes in 2015 to just 50,000 tonnes during 2022. In contrast, raw silk production in India had reached 38,913 metric tonnes in 2023-24, Mr. Sivakumar said expressing confidence that India could soon become the world\u2019s number one silk producing country. India\u2019s dependence on the import of raw silk from China too had come down to a large extent in the last few years as the country had increased the import-substitute bivoltine silk in the last few years. The production of bivoltine silk, which is superior in quality, had increased from 475 metric tonnes in 1995-96 to 9,021 metric tonnes in 2023-24. When asked for the reasons for the decline in raw silk production in China, Mr. Sivakumar pointed out that sericulture, which is a labour intensive occupation, was facing a competition from other crops in China. Incubation centre Meanwhile, the Central Silk Board (CSB) will be inaugurating a Sericulture Technology Incubation Centre (STIC) in Mysuru during its platinum jubilee celebrations to be held at the Convocation Hall of Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) on September 20. Mr. Sivakumar said the incubation centre would be housed on the premises of the Central Sericultural Research and Training Institute (CSRTI) in Mysuru. CSRTI Director Gandhi Doss said the STIC will support startups and entrepreneurs looking forward to building upon the technologies developed by CSB institutions across the country. The technologies include by-products of the sericulture industry as well as products developed for the control of diseases in mulberry plants.

            "content": "Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Atishi is set to become Delhi\u2019s third woman Chief Ministe r, with party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal submitting his resignation to Lieutenant Governor (L-G) V.K. Saxena on Tuesday (September 17, 2024). Ms. Atishi, who was elected leader of the AAP legislature party earlier in the day, submitted her request to the L-G to stake claim to form the government. Currently, she is a Cabinet Minister and holds many important portfolios, including Revenue, Education, and Public Works Department. Also Read: Kejriwal resignation highlights Earlier in the day, calling Mr. Kejriwal her \u201cguru\u201d, Ms. Atishi told the media that \u201cthere is only one Chief Minister of Delhi and the CM\u2019s name is Arvind Kejriwal\u201d. She underlined that she is the Chief Minister only for a few months till the next Assembly election. The election is due in February, but the AAP has requested the Election Commission to hold it along with Maharashtra in November. Ms. Atishi said the party\u2019s, and her priority would be to make sure that Mr. Kejriwal would be elected Chief Minister again. On Sunday (September 15, 2024), Mr. Kejriwal announced that he would resign as Chief Minister and he would not return to the Chief Minister\u2019s chair until he got the people\u2019s mandate as a certificate of his honesty. The shock announcement came two days after the Supreme Court granted him bail in the Delhi excise policy case. Also Read: Watch | Atishi gets unanimous support from AAP for Delhi CM\u2019s post: Gopal Rai \u2018False cases\u2019 Ms. Atishi alleged that the BJP put false cases on Mr. Kejriwal and kept him inside jail for six months and finally, the Supreme Court gave him bail and called the Central government\u2019s investigative agencies a caged parrot. \u201cPeople of Delhi, our MLAs, and I being the Chief Minister of Delhi for a few months till the election, will work with only intention \u2014 to make Mr. Kejriwal Chief Minister again. Until I handle this big responsibility, I will have one intention, I know that the BJP will try to conspire against Delhiites through the L-G. They will try to stop free electricity, stop free medicines, shut mohalla clinics, and ruin the government schools. As long as I have this responsibility for a few months, I will make sure to protect the people of Delhi and under the guidance of Arvind Kejriwal ji , run the Delhi government,\u201d Ms. Atishi said. She added that she was happy that Mr. Kejriwal had trusted her so much, but she was more sad than happy because Delhi\u2019s popular Chief Minister and her elder brother Mr. Kejriwal was resigning and requested people to not congratulate her or give her garlands. The BJP was quick to launch an attack on Ms. Atishi calling her a dummy Chief Minister and alleged that the AAP was now trying to give the party a makeover, but no matter how hard they try, they won\u2019t be able to hide the \u201cblack spots of corruption\u201d. Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav said Ms. Atishi should rise to the occasion and solve the problems of the people of Delhi, particularly women, as attacks on them had increased. He expressed confidence that the next Chief Minister would be from the Congress as the AAP had lost its credibility among the people of Delhi.

Milestones Ever since the CSB was set up on April 9, 1949, under an Act of the Parliament passed in 1948, India\u2019s global share of silk production had grown from a mere 6 per cent in 1949-50 to 42 per cent in 2023-34, said Sivakumar. Raw silk production in the country had grown from 1,242 metric tonnes in 1949-50 to 38,913 metric tonnes in 2023-24 while mulberry plantation had increased from 0.57 lakh hectares in 1949-50 to 2.63 lakh hectare in 2023-24. Raw silk productivity, which was 15 kgs per hectare in 1949-50, had increased to 110 kgs per hectare in 2023-24. Interestingly, 17 kgs of cocoon were required to produce one kg of silk yarn in 1949-50, but in 2023-24, one kg of silk is being produced from just 7 kgs of cocoon. The import substitute bivoltine raw silk production in India had increased to 9,675 metric tonnes in 2023-24 from just 475 metric tonnes in 1995-96. Sllk exports Silk exports from India had increased from \u20b90.41 crore in 1949-50 to \u20b92,028 crore in 2023-24, said Mr. Sivakumar adding that employment generation from sericulture had reached 9.5 million in India.

            "content": "The liquor prohibition conference planned by Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) on October 2 is an attempt to deceive the public who were looking forward for closure of Tasmac outlets in Tamil Nadu, contended Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader H. Raja in Coimbatore on Tuesday. VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan, who met Chief Minister MK Stalin on Monday, should have asked for definite closure of Tasmac outlets in the State. The State government said it had closed 500 outlets. But, it had actually opened 1,000 outlets (clubs). The conference was a facade to deceive the public, he charged. Bihar had introduced total prohibition recently. Tamil Nadu could also do so. The revenue of Tasmac outlets in the State was \u20b948,700 crore annually. In Madhya Pradesh, it was \u20b913,000 crores. There seemed to be a drive to increase alcohol consumption in Tamil Nadu, he charged. Asked about possibility of alliance between the BJP and the AIADMK, he said alliances were decided by the Central Parliament Board of BJP. The party currently was in an alliance with TMC, PMK, AMMK, etc in the State.

            "content": "Better coordination between the cyber division of the State police and the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) will help rein in cybercrimes more effectively, Putta Vimaladitya, who recently took charge as District Police Chief (Kochi City), has said. Speaking at a meet-the-press organised by the Ernakulam Press Club here on Tuesday, he cited dealing with cybercrimes as one of his four priority areas. Fight against drugs and miscreants, and streamlining traffic were the others, he said. He drew attention to how cybercrimes, in which criminals from many States were involved, presented a major challenge to the police. The I4C was established by the Home Ministry to provide a framework and ecosystem for law enforcement agencies to deal with cybercrimes in a coordinated and comprehensive manner. Enforcement along with education about the modus operandi applied in latest cybercrimes and how not to fall prey to cyberfraud formed the foundation of the strategy against cybercrimes. \u201cRegistering such crimes, diligently probing them and detecting the accused, and recovering the lost money of victims are also significant parts of that strategy,\u201d Mr. Vimaladitya said. Often SIM cards and bank accounts are not used by those in whose names they are registered. Overcoming these challenges called for new investigation methods and better coordination with other departments, Mr. Vimaladitya said. He added that careless disclosure of credentials over social media and not following cyber safety best practices often led to the loss of data, which was exploited by fraudsters. Indiscriminate installation of applications with scant regard for safety and security and data leak from institutionalised systems also lead to data vulnerabilities. Mr. Vimaladitya said that creating awareness about cyber safety best practices through residents\u2019 associations, organisations of professional agencies, and activities in schools and colleges would be explored. The possibility of using social media reels and videos would also be explored. Drug menace He said that repeat offenders under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act would be mapped for better enforcement against the drug menace. The officer added that the city police had detected 27 cases involving commercial quantities of drugs so far this year. Detection and awareness would be further strengthened along with targeted police patrol during nights. Mr. Vimaladitya, who also holds the full additional charge of the post of Deputy Inspector General, Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), said the arrest of armed activists alone could not be cited as proof for the eradication of the ideology of Maoism.

            "content": "Iran's ambassador in Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, has been wounded in the explosion of pagers in the country, Iranian news reported on Tuesday. \"Amani has a superficial injury and is currently under observation in a hospital,\" Fars quoted a source as saying. More than 1,000 people across Lebanon, including Hezbollah fighters and medics, were wounded on Tuesday when the pagers they use to communicate exploded, security sources told Reuters. Officials pointed the finger at Israel in what appeared to be a sophisticated, remote attack at a time of rising tensions across the Lebanon border. A Hezbollah official who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that \u201cseveral hundred\u201d people, including members of the group, were wounded in different parts of Lebanon when their handheld pagers exploded. He said a few Hezbollah fighters were also wounded in Syria when the pagers they were carrying exploded, and said it was believed to be an Israeli attack. Iran's semi-official Fars news agency, close to the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard, said on its Telegram channel that Mojtaba Amani, Iran's ambassador in Lebanon, has a superficial injury and is under observation at a hospital. Another semi-official Mehr news agency, also on its Telegram channel, reported that Amani was wounded by a pager explosion. Photos and videos from Beirut's southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the group's members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes. Lebanon's Health Ministry called on all hospitals to be on alert to take in emergency patients and for people who own pagers to get away from them. It also asked health workers to avoid using wireless devices. AP photographers at area hospitals said the emergency rooms were overloaded with patients, many of them with injuries to their limbs, some in serious condition. The state-run National News Agency said hospitals in southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut's southern suburbs \u2014 all areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence \u2014 had called on people to donate blood of all types. The news agency reported that in Beirut's southern suburbs and other areas \u201cthe handheld pagers system was detonated using advanced technology, and dozens of injuries were reported.\u201d The Hezbollah official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media said the explosions were the result of \u201ca security operation that targeted the devices.\u201d \u201cThe enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident,\u201d the official said, without elaborating. He added that the new pagers that Hezbollah members were carrying had lithium batteries that apparently exploded.",

Balaji Chakravarthi, 46, and his wife B. Selvi, residents of Pongaliyur at Veerakeralam in the city, were arrested on Monday based on a complaint lodged by R.

The couple promised 100 % recovery for the condition, according to the complainant, who paid a total of \u20b92.70 lakh for treatment between August 14, 2023 and July 25, 2024. The complainant alleged that the accused subjected his grandson to a brutal form of treatment on July 25, 2024 due to which the boy\u2019s left thigh was swollen. The boy was later taken to a private hospital at R.S. Puram, where doctors found that his left thigh bone had a fracture, said the police. Mr. Ramachandran lodged a complaint with the R.S. Puram police on Monday, seeking action against the couple and a compensation of \u20b925 lakh. R.S. Puram Inspector S. Kasipandian said the couple offered alternative treatment for neurological conditions and they were not registered medical practitioners. The police arrested Chakravarthi and Selvi on Monday for offences under Sections 117 (2) (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 34 (2) (bar to practice) of the National Medical Commission Act, 2019. They were remanded in judicial custody. Published - September 17, 2024 08:45 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Coimbatore / health",

            "content": "The police on Monday arrested a 22-year-old college student for running over a 66-year-old man sleeping on the pavement with an SUV in Thousand Lights last week. The police identified the victim as Paneerselvam, 66, of Thousand Lights. On the night of September 13, he was sleeping on the pavement near the parking lot of a hotel in the area. The next day, his relatives found his body and assumed that he had died of age-related problems. As they were preparing to cremate the body, they noticed bleeding in the ears and became suspicious about the cause of death. They decided to check the CCTV footage from the night of the incident and approached a hotel in the area where Paneerselvam had been sleeping that night. On scrutinising the footage, they discovered that an SUV had run over Paneerselvam around midnight. The relatives lodged a complaint with the police and presented the footage as evidence. The Traffic Investigation Police, Pondy Bazaar, registered a case for causing death due to negligence and used the registration number of the SUV to trace the suspect, who was identified as Aditya Raj Singh, 22, of Jharkhand.

            "content": "People of all age groups dancing to music during the immersion procession in Hubballi on Tuesday.| Photo Credit:KIRAN BAKALE It was yet again a time for public show of devotion and revelry in Hubballi on Tuesday as thousands of people of all age groups came out in large numbers to participate in the immersion procession of Ganesh idols, the concluding event of the 11-day festivities of Ganesh Chaturthi festival. The rituals of bidding adieu to the Elephant God began in the morning at hundreds of Ganesh pandals spread across the city, with devout Hindus participating in the final maha mangalarati and other rituals in good numbers. Post-rituals, several of them bid for the puja material and the offerings made to Lord Ganesh in auctions held just before the arrangements to shift the idols to trailers were made. Technically, the immersion processions began relatively much early, with a few huge idols of Ganesha being moved out of the pandals. But like always, they moved at a snail\u2019s pace subsequently as large number of people joined the celebrations and unprecedented numbers came to watch the grand spectacle. Two of the gigantic idols of Ganesh, Hubballi Ka Raja at Dajibanpet and Hubballi Ka Maharaja at Marattha Galli, attracted huge crowds as many gathered to see the huge idols measuring over 25 ft being moved out of the pandals. Amid loud cheer by the crowd the idols were moved out of the pandals and what followed next was sheer revelry with people of all age groups, including girls and women, in large numbers dancing to the tune of hit numbers belted out by high decibel sound systems. At a few places, traditional percussion instruments like dollu and jaggalige provided the much-needed foot thumping music for the revellers.

Shashikumar monitoring bandobast and route diversions to facilitate easy movement of vehicles on alternative roads. Speaking to presspersons in the morning, Mr. Shashikumar clarified that public announcement system is to be shut down by 10 p.m. as per order of the Supreme Court and there is no relaxation, which, he said, has been specifically conveyed to the elected representatives and the Ganesh Mandals. Mr. Shashikumar said that during the ninth day immersion procession, the Ganesh Mandals had adhered to the deadline and consequently, more people had participated in the procession after the high decibel music systems were shut down. Like it was done before, the police had deployed additional police personnel at strategic points to keep vigil over trouble mongers. The command centre also kept vigil through the surveillance cameras in the city. Brindavan Circle and Kittur Chennamma Circle were the ideal spots for people who came to watch the immersion processions. The pavements, the stairs, the balconies and the terrace in the vicinity became vantage points for the onlookers At designated places, members of Muslim community welcomed the immersion processions, while religious heads, elected representatives and officers took part in the formal inauguration of the immersion procession organised by Sarvajanik Ganeshotsava Samitigala Mahamandala, a federation of all Ganesh Mandals. After the formal inauguration, the idols were carried in a procession one after the other on the designated route with sets of police officials and personnel monitoring the movement. The processions moved at snail\u2019s pace as in front of every idol, there was a big group of revellers willing to dance to their heart\u2019s content. The celebrations continued late into the night. Published - September 17, 2024 08:39 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Mr. Anil, who reiterated that the Statewide mustering is exclusively for priority (yellow and pink) ration cardholders, emphasised that separate camps were not necessary for the purpose. The decision was taken after considering the available resources and the number of card holders yet to take part in the process. The exercise is being undertaken in three phrases, with the initial phase from September 18 to 24 allotted for Thiruvananthapuram district alone. Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam and Thrissur will come under the second phase from September 25 to October 1.

            "content": "Senior AAP leader Dilip Pandey accused Ms Maliwal of following the BJP's narrative, despite being nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the AAP. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has asked for the resignation of Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal following her critical comments about senior party leader Atishi, who has been named as the next Chief Minister of Delhi. Senior AAP leader Dilip Pandey accused Ms. Maliwal of following the BJP's narrative, despite being nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the AAP. Dilip Pandey's Accusations Against Swati Maliwal Dilip Pandey, a senior figure in the AAP, sharply criticized Ms. Maliwal, claiming she had betrayed the party by aligning with the BJP's views. \"Swati Maliwal accepted a Rajya Sabha ticket from the AAP but chooses to follow a BJP script. If she has any integrity left, she should resign from the Rajya Sabha and seek re-election on a BJP ticket,\" Pandey said. This public demand for resignation highlights the growing tensions between Maliwal and the AAP, which have been building since earlier controversies. Rift Between Swati Maliwal and AAP The current dispute between Maliwal and her party escalated after she alleged that Bibhav Kumar, an aide to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, had assaulted her at the CM\u2019s residence. This incident marked a turning point in the relationship between the MP and AAP leadership, leading to public friction. Maliwal's Criticism of Atishi's Appointment On the day the AAP officially named Atishi as Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s successor for the Chief Minister's post, Maliwal voiced strong opposition. In a social media post, she described the development as a \"sad day\" for Delhi, bringing up a controversial accusation that Atishi\u2019s family had defended convicted terrorist Afzal Guru. \"Today is a tragic day for Delhi. A woman whose family fought to save Afzal Guru from being hanged is being made Chief Minister. Her parents sent mercy petitions to the President to prevent Afzal Guru\u2019s execution,\" Maliwal wrote. She went on to call Atishi a \"dummy CM\" and questioned her family's political stance, raising concerns about national security. Maliwal\u2019s remarks further included accusations that Atishi\u2019s parents believed Afzal Guru was wrongly convicted as part of a political conspiracy. \"Though Atishi Marlena is merely a \u2018dummy CM\u2019, this issue touches upon the security of the nation. May God protect Delhi,\" Maliwal added, intensifying the political storm.",

            "content": "CCTV captured the moment a man's bag exploded in a supermarket in the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Tuesday (September 17). The location was verified as a supermarket in Beirut, Lebanon from the floor tiling patterns and ceiling which match file imagery of the interior of the shop. The video also carries the date and time stamp. Thousands of members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, including fighters and medics, were seriously wounded when the pagers they use to communicate exploded, a security source told Reuters. A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the detonation of the pagers was the \"biggest security breach\" the group had been subjected to in nearly a year of war with Israel. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military to Reuters' enquiries about the detonations. Photos and videos from Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the group\u2019s members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes. Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry called on all hospitals to be on alert to take in emergency patients and for people who own pagers to get away from them. It also asked health workers to avoid using wireless devices. AP photographers at area hospitals said the emergency rooms were overloaded with patients, many of them with injuries to their limbs, some in serious condition. The state-run National News Agency said hospitals in southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs \u2014 all areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence \u2014 had called on people to donate blood of all types. The news agency reported that in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and other areas \u201cthe handheld pagers system was detonated using advanced technology, and dozens of injuries were reported.\u201d A Hezbollah official said that at least 150 people, including members of the group, were wounded in different parts of Lebanon when the pagers they were carrying exploded. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the explosions were the result of \u201ca security operation that targeted the devices.\u201d \u201cThe enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident,\u201d the official said, without elaborating. He added that the new pagers that Hezbollah members were carrying had lithium batteries that apparently exploded. Lithium batteries, when overheated, can smoke, melt and even catch on fire. Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars. Lithium battery fires can burn up to 590 C (1,100 F). The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas in Gaza. The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. On Tuesday, Israel said that halting Hezbollah\u2019s attacks in the north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal. (With inputs from agencies)",

            "content": "India imports a large quantity of edible oils to meet domestic demand. The dependence on imports is more than 50 per cent of total requirements. New Delhi: The government has asked edible oil processors not to hike retail prices following a recent increase in import duties, as there is an enough stock of cooking oils that were shipped at a lower duty. The food ministry said the stocks imported at lower duties would easily last 45-50 days, and therefore the processors should refrain from increasing maximum retail prices (MRP). Last week, the Centre implemented an increase in the basic customs duty on various edible oils to support domestic oilseed prices. Effective September 14, 2024, the basic customs duty on crude soyabean oil, crude palm oil, and crude sunflower oil has been raised to 20 per cent from nil, making the effective duty on crude oils to 27.5 per cent. Additionally, the basic customs duty on refined palm oil, refined sunflower oil, and refined soyabean oil has been increased from 12.5 per cent to 32.5 per cent, making the effective duty on refined oils to 35.75 per cent. On Tuesday, Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra chaired a meeting with the representatives from the Solvent Extraction Association of India (SEA), Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association (IVPA) and Soyabean Oil Producers Association (SOPA) to discuss the pricing strategy. \"The leading edible oil associations were advised to ensure that the MRP of each oil is maintained till the availability of edible oil stocks imported at 0 per cent and 12.5 per cent Basic Customs Duty (BCD) and take up the issue with their members immediately,\" an official statement said. \"The central government is also aware that there is close to 30 lakh tonnes stock of edible oils imported at lower duty which is sufficient for 45 to 50 days domestic consumption,\" it added. India imports a large quantity of edible oils to meet domestic demand. The dependence on imports is more than 50 per cent of total requirements. The decision to hike import duties is part of the government's ongoing efforts to bolster domestic oilseed farmers, especially with the new soybean and groundnut crops expected to arrive in markets from October 2024, the food ministry said. \"The decision follows comprehensive deliberations and is influenced by several factors: increased global production of soybean, oil palm, and other oilseeds; higher global ending stocks of edible oils compared to last year; and falling global prices due to surplus production. \"This situation has led to a surge in imports of inexpensive oils, exerting downward pressure on domestic prices. By raising the landed cost of imported edible oils, these measures aim to enhance domestic oilseed prices, support increased production, and ensure that farmers receive fair compensation for their produce,\" the ministry explained. India imports palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia, while the country imports soyabean oil from Brazil and Argentina. Sunflower oil comes mainly from Russia and Ukraine.",

            "content": "The organisers of Mahisha Mandaluthsava are planning to invite Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, Mysuru MP, to inaugurate the event scheduled to be held on September 29 this year. Former Mayor Purushotham, who heads the organising committee of Mahisha Mandaluthsava, said the committee has decided to invite the Mysuru MP, who is also a descendent of the erstwhile royal family of Mysore, to inaugurate the event. Organised as Mahisha Dasara every year, the committee is planning to celebrate the event as Mahisha Mandaluthsava this year by holding a public function at Town Hall after garlanding the statue of Mahisha atop Chamundi Hills on September 29. On September 21, a seminar will be held in the city to discuss the history of Mahishasura and clarify the myths associated with him. Mr. Purushotham said the Organising Committee\u2019s near consensus on inviting Mr. Yaduveer to inaugurate the Mahisha Mandalutsava as he had reportedly said people were free to celebrate the event if they wished. \u201cWe will formally invite him for the inauguration in two days\u201d, Mr. Purushotham said. \u201cThe statue of Mahisha has been installed atop Chamundi Hills by the erstwhile royal family. Let a descendant from the family tell the people about it,\u201d he said. Reacting to the opposition to the event from former MP Pratap Simha, Mr. Purushotham said the former MP does not have any moral right to oppose Mahisha Mandaluthsava. Hitting out at Pratap Simha for opposing the event, Mr. Purushotham said they were the indigenous people of the country and they had been worshipping Mahisha for the last several years. Mahisha was not a demon as he is sought to be projected, Mr. Purushotham argued. Published - September 17, 2024 08:32 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

While 1,559 candidates had filed nominations, after scrutiny, 1,221 were found valid and the candidature of 338 rejected. Candidates were allowed to file their nomination papers between September 5 to 12. The scrutiny of the nominations took place on September 13, with the deadline for candidates to withdraw their nominations until September 16. Out of the 1,221 nominations cleared, 190 candidates withdrew, the Election Commission (EC) said. Seventeen candidates are contesting from Panchkula, 39 from Ambala, 40 from Yamunanagar, 43 from Kurukshetra, 53 from Kaithal, 55 from Karnal, 36 from Panipat, 65 from Sonipat, 72 from Jind, 40 from Fatehabad, 54 from Sirsa, 89 from Hisar, 33 from Dadri, 56 from Bhiwani, 56 from Rohtak, 42 from Jhajjar, 37 from Mahendragarh, 39 from Rewari, 47 from Gurugram, 21 from Nuh, 33 from Palwal, and 64 from Faridabad district. All 90 seats in Haryana would go to polls on October 5. Counting would be held on October 8. The EC had postponed the date of polling for the Haryana Assembly election to October 5 from October 1, keeping in mind a centuries-old festival of the Bishnoi community in remembrance of Guru Jambheshwar. The poll body had received representations from the national president of the All India Bishnoi Mahasabha, Bikaner, Rajasthan seeking the rescheduling of the date. The association said that the festival fell on October 2 and thousands of Bishnoi families residing in Sirsa, Fatehabad and Hisar would be travelling to Rajasthan during those days and would be unable to vote. The EC had also got requests from the Haryana BJP unit for postponement of polls because of holidays, immediately before and after October 1.

Israel-Lebanon Conflict: In a scene reminiscent of a sci-fi movie, thousands of pagers, reportedly used by members of the US-designated terror group Hezbollah for communication, suddenly exploded in what is believed to be a cyberattack carried out by Israel. Some of the explosions were captured on CCTV, while videos circulated online showing people injured by the blasts. Hezbollah officials said that at least two of its members and a girl were killed when the group's new brand of pagers exploded Hezbollah has accused Israel of being behind the attack, calling it the \"biggest security breach\" it has ever experienced. Hezbollah, which is banned by both the United States and the European Union, serves as a significant political and military force in Lebanon and is backed by Iran.

            "content": "India's gold imports, which have a bearing on the country's current account deficit (CAD), dipped by 4.23 per cent to USD 12.64 billion during April-July 2024-25. New Delhi: Gold imports more than doubled in August to a record high of USD 10.06 billion, mainly on account of a drastic cut in customs duty and ongoing festive demand, according to the Commerce Ministry data. Gold imports stood at USD 4.93 billion in August 2023. On record high imports, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said that the tariff rates on gold have been reduced drastically so that smuggling and other activities can come down. \"And this is the time when jewellers start stocking for their inventories to be sold in the festival season,\" he told reporters. In the Budget, the government slashed the duty from 15 per cent to 6 per cent. India's gold imports, which have a bearing on the country's current account deficit (CAD), dipped by 4.23 per cent to USD 12.64 billion during April-July 2024-25. In 2023-24, India's gold imports surged by 30 per cent to USD 45.54 billion. Switzerland is the largest source of gold imports, with about 40 per cent share, followed by the UAE (over 16 per cent) and South Africa (about 10 per cent). The precious metal accounts for over 5 per cent of the country's total imports. The jump in gold imports pushed the country's trade deficit (difference between imports and exports) to USD 29.65 billion in August. India is the world's second-biggest gold consumer after China. The imports mainly take care of the demand by the jewellery industry. India recorded a current account surplus of USD 5.7 billion or 0.6 per cent of GDP in the March quarter. For FY24, the current account deficit narrowed to USD 23.2 billion or 0.7 per cent of GDP against USD 67 billion or 2 per cent of GDP in FY23. A current account deficit occurs when the value of goods and services imported and other payments exceeds the value of the export of goods and services and other receipts by a country in a particular period. India is seeking a review of certain provisions of the free trade agreement with the UAE, which came into force on May 1, 2022. The review assumes significance as experts have raised serious concerns over the spurt in imports of precious metals from the UAE under the trade agreement. Seeking an urgent review of the pact, think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has stated that the India-UAE CEPA allows unlimited imports of gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds from the UAE into India with zero tariffs in the coming years. This will lead to significant annual revenue losses, move import business from banks to a few private traders, and replace top suppliers with Dubai-based firms, the GTRI report has said. It highlighted that currently, gold can be imported from Dubai at 5 per cent duty, but this will drop to zero in three years if the alloy contains 2 per cent platinum. GTRI has also claimed that many imports do not meet Rules of Origin conditions and, hence, do not qualify for concessions.",

Having gained its spot in ACL Two as the Indian Super League shield champion, Mohun Bagan will look to make the qualification count by making a positive start. The legacy of being the oldest surviving club in Asia will definitely drive Mohun Bagan as it plans its approach against the visitor, which it will be meeting for the first time. The other two teams in the group are the Iranian side Tractor and Al-Wakrah FC of Qatar. The group league stage will be played on a home-and-away basis, with the top two teams moving into the knock-outs (round of 16). The start of the season has been a mixed bag for Mohun Bagan. It reached the Durand Cup final before losing the crown to NorthEast United FC on penalties. In the ISL, the visiting Mumbai City FC held it 2-2 to pose questions about the team\u2019s defensive quality. \u201cThe ACL Two is a big competition. All matches will be very difficult as all teams here are quite good. But tomorrow with our fans helping us, hopefully we can have a good match and get our first three points from the group stage,\u201d Mohun Bagan head coach Jose Molina observed on the eve of the match. The competition rules allow an unlimited number of foreigners in a side, but Molina may have a slight disadvantage as two of his six imports \u2014 Australian forward Jamie Maclaren and Spanish defender Alberto Rodriguez \u2014 are nursing injuries. This would mean more responsibility for the Indian contingent, which Molina hoped would perform to its potential.

            "description": "The direction was given in a suo motu case concerning the construction of a road within the Perumbakkam wetland. The road was found to be adjacent to the boundary of the Pallikaranai Marshland Reserve Forest, a Ramsar site",
            "content": "The Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Tamil Nadu government to survey the entire Pallikaranai marshland based on the revenue records from 1911. In a suo motu case concerning the construction of a road within the Perumbakkam wetland, the Bench, comprising Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana and expert member Satyagopal Korlapati, on Tuesday directed the Department of Survey and Settlement to conduct a comprehensive survey of the Pallikaranai marshland. This survey should be based on the 1911 revenue records as well as the current extent of the marshland. The issue concerns an access road laid by a private developer for constructing residential buildings in Perumbakkam. Following an inspection, the Tamil Nadu State Wetland Authority had found that the road falls within the influence zone, and is adjacent to the boundary, of the Pallikaranai Marshland Reserve Forest, a Ramsar site. In response, the Bench instructed the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to consult with the wetland authority before approving any building permits, even on patta land. The CMDA, in an affidavit, had stated that no building permits had been issued for land designated as part of the Pallikaranai marshland. Additionally, the CMDA noted that without survey numbers from the wetland authority identifying the Pallikaranai marshland boundaries, updating the Second Master Plan for the Chennai Metropolitan Area was not feasible. However, once the wetland authority provides the necessary details, the CMDA will incorporate them into the Third Master Plan (2027-46) and adhere to the marshland restrictions. Meanwhile, in the compliance with the report filed by the former Chengalpattu Collector on September 22, 2023, it was noted that according to the 1911 Revision Survey Re-Settlement (RSR) Paisathi Register, survey numbers 286/1 and 286/2 (the area in question) had been designated as government wetlands. However, Mr. Koralapati observed discrepancies between this report and the latest one. The current report by the incumbent Collector stated that according to the 1911 RSR records, survey number 286 in Perumbakkam village is classified as patta land, with ryotwari pattas granted to private individuals. These pattas are ryotwari pattas and, thus, cannot be considered conditional pattas, the report stated. In response, the Bench directed the Collector to clarify this discrepancy and provide supporting documents. The matter has been posted for next hearing on October 18.

            "description": "The two-week-long cleanliness campaign across railway stations and other railway premises featuring a wide range of activities aimed at promoting a cleaner environment will conclude on October 1",
            "content": "The Mysuru division of South Western Railway on Tuesday, September 17, initiated the \u201cSwachhta Hi Sewa\u201d, a two-week-long cleanliness drive, which will run from September 17 to October 1. The event began with Shilpi Agarwal, Divisional Railway Manager, Mysuru, administering the Swachhta Pledge to officers and staff at the amphitheatre of the Divisional Railway Manager\u2019s Office and also with the plantation of saplings at Railway Hospital. As part of the broader Swachhata Hi Sewa Campaign which began on Tuesday, this initiative will engage railway employees and the public in efforts to enhance cleanliness across railway stations, trains, offices, and other railway premises. The Swachhta campaign will conclude on October 1 and will feature a wide range of activities aimed at promoting a cleaner environment, hygiene practices, and waste management. During the inaugural event, Ms. Agarwal emphasised the importance of maintaining cleanliness in public spaces and encouraged Railway officers, staff, and passengers to actively contribute to the campaign. The campaign is structured under various themes like Swachhata Ki Bhaagidari and Sampoorna Swachata, focusing on collaborative efforts to sustain cleanliness in all railway facilities. The \u2018Swachhta Hi Sewa\u2019 campaign will involve several important activities aimed at promoting cleanliness. Staff, their families, and Safai Karmacharis will take a pledge to support cleanliness. Public awareness workshops will be held to educate employees and passengers on the importance of hygiene. Special health camps will be organised for Safai Karamcharis to ensure their well-being, and tree saplings will be planted as part of a green initiative called \u201cEk Ped Maa Ke Naam,\u201d according to the Division. The campaign will also focus on managing waste by encouraging people to reduce, reuse, and recycle, with activities like door-to-door waste segregation and creating art from waste materials. Large-scale cleanliness drives will be conducted at railway stations, colonies, and trains, and public facilities like toilets and water bodies will also be cleaned. Additionally, cultural programs, quizzes, and art displays will be held to involve the public and railway staff, helping everyone take responsibility for keeping their surroundings clean, a note said here. On October 2, as part of the Gandhi Jayanti celebrations, the Division will organise a Combined Shramdaan event, involving railway staff, passengers, and local personalities to clean railway premises and surrounding areas. Passengers will also be educated on the use of bio-toilets, and their feedback on cleanliness in railway facilities will be collected. The campaign will conclude with an awards ceremony, recognizing Safai Karamcharis and participants in Swachhta Hi Seva 2024 for their efforts in maintaining cleanliness. South Western Railway, which has received the Swachhta Shield for its exemplary work in cleanliness for the past two years, is committed to making this campaign successful. All Railway Departments, including stations, hospitals, depots, and other units, are encouraged to actively participate and contribute towards maintaining a clean and green Railway environment, the Division said.

            "content": "Members of the West Bengal Junior Doctors Front told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that they would \u201cin principle\u201d want to rejoin work after over a month of protests against the brutal rape and murder of their young colleague at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata following assurances from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at a meeting held on Monday (September 16, 2024), but they were still haunted by a \u201cfear psychosis\u201d. Appearing before a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud , senior advocate Indira Jaising, for the junior doctors, confided in the courtroom that those responsible behind the \u201ccover-up\u201d about the gruesome crime on August 9 were still \u201croaming\u201d in the hospital and would subject them to victimisation on rejoining work. Ms. Jaising said a \u201csettlement\u201d had been reached after the fifth round of talks held with Ms. Banerjee on Monday (September 16, 2024). She said the Front had sent 40 representatives for the meeting regardless of the fact that the State had not met any of the pre-conditions the top court had set on September 9 for the doctors to join work the next day at 5 p.m. The senior advocate said the Front would hold a general body meeting \u201ctoday or tomorrow\u201d to reach a \u201cbroad consensus\u201d. There might be a \u201cgap of time\u201d before taking a final call. \u201cBut it is our belief, rightly or wrongly, that those responsible for the disaster are still at R.G. Kar there. We would be victimised. We need some kind of assurance from the court. Give us any assurance. There is a fear psychosis. We want to go back to work,\u201d Ms. Jaising submitted. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Astha Sharma, for West Bengal, said the Chief Minister herself had given the assurance that no punitive action would be taken against the protesting doctors who return to work. \u201cWhat more do they want?\u201d he asked. Turning the question on its head, Ms. Jaising retorted, \u201cAnd what punitive action would be taken by you against those who did this to us?\u201d She said the government had not taken any administrative action against officials of the State, the university or Medical Council, who had a responsibility to monitor the working conditions of doctors which could have averted the tragedy. Cites CM\u2019s assurance The Chief Justice reached out to allay the apprehensions of the doctors against any punitive action occasioned by their abstention from work. The court recorded the assurance of the Chief Minister in its judicial order. \u201cWe are seized of the matter. We are still being apprised by the Central Bureau of Investigation of the nature of the hush-up that took place. When we have a better picture and the material, we will issue orders,\u201d Chief Justice Chandrachud addressed Ms. Jaising and senior advocate Karuna Nundy. The court said it was already examining, through the periodic status reports filed confidentially by the CBI, about any instances of corruption; the nature of financial irregularities at R.G. Kar; if there were any omissions or commissions in the performance of duties by the former Principal; and whether there were any attempts to cover up the crime. The Bench ticked off a lawyer who sought an order for the resignation of Chief Minister Ms. Banerjee, saying the court was not a political forum and its attention was restricted to bettering the conditions of the doctors. The apex court recorded submissions by the State government that infrastructure and safety facilities, including separate duty rooms, washrooms and installation of additional CCTV cameras across government-run medical colleges and hospitals across West Bengal would be completed in the next 14 days. The Bench said the infrastructure improvements should be done through a \u201cparticipatory process\u201d. Each district must have a committee of the District Collector, police chief and representatives of senior and junior doctors, the court directed. The court asked the State to take into consideration the Front\u2019s suggestions like a broad-based committee of doctors, nurses and other staff to monitor the safety situation in each government hospital; a grievance redressal system; an internal complaints committee compliant with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 within the next three days. The State said 910 women personnel scheduled to be deployed in government medical colleges and hospitals were already undergoing training in police institutes. At the end of the hearing, Mr. Sibal asked an oft-repeated question in court from the State\u2019s side: \u201cWhen will they rejoin work now?\u201d \u201cI cannot give a date,\u201d Ms. Jaising replied curtly. To this, Chief Justice Chandrachud observed that \u201cwe have created conditions for them to come back to work\u201d. The apex court listed the case for further hearing after a week.

He was in an inebriated state at the time of the incident, the police said. Published - September 17, 2024 08:15 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

In the first such arrest, in coordination with the Chaitanyapuri police, sleuths arrested Gugan Narender, 25, while he was delivering the contraband near Genius Grammar School. The police said 199 grams of opium worth \u20b93.50 lakh and about \u20b911,000 in cash was seized from him. In another operation with the LB Nagar police, sleuths arrested fruit supplier, Ghasiram Pangi, near the service road of NTR Nagar Vegetable Market while he was delivering hashish oil concealed with custard apples. The police said 632.98 grams of hashish oil worth \u20b94.30 lakh was seized from the accused. Ghasiram along with his brother Jagannadh Kamudi has been frequenting Hyderabad from Odisha to sell seasonal fruits in Sultan Bazaar, said police.

After selling fruits at Sultan Bazaar, Ghasiram went to NTR Nagar Vegetable Market in LB Nagar and was waiting for a call from Jagannadh for the delivery when the police nabbed him. While the two peddlers have been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, efforts are underway to trace both the suppliers - Sampath and Jagannadh, the police added.

            "content": "Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala has demanded that the government release the actual figures related to the relief works for the Wayanad landslides disaster. Speaking to mediapersons here on Tuesday, he expressed concern that providing incorrect figures might jeopardise the aid expected from the Central government. Mr. Chennithala questioned whether the term \u2018actuals\u2019 in the government\u2019s report actually meant the amounts spent or if it was merely an estimate. He also raised suspicion that some organisations might have been excluded from food distribution to inflate the numbers for others. He stressed the need for accurate figures to ensure adequate assistance for rehabilitation. Mr. Chennithala alleged that the reports and the government\u2019s explanations had left numerous unanswered questions regarding the Wayanad relief works. He pointed out many discrepancies in the report. For example, the report showed that the average cost for cremating a body was \u20b975,000 under \u2018actuals\u2019. Is this the actual expenditure? Are there invoices for these payments? Of the 4,100 people in the relief camps, 1,871 left within a week or two. Despite this, the report claimed \u20b98 crore had been spent on food for a month for these people, implying an average of over \u20b91,000 per person per day. What does this mean? Kerala and other areas sent substantial amount of clothing for the disaster victims, yet the cost for clothing reported as \u2018actuals\u2019 was \u20b911 crore. How is this figure justified? For the operation of generators in 17 camps, \u20b97 crore had been reported. Are these figures accurate according to basic logic? How much was actually spent? Mr. Chennithala urged the government to resolve all confusion related to the Wayanad relief efforts and address all public doubts. He criticised the government\u2019s handling of financial matters, pointing out that public trust in the government was eroding due to these issues.

District Congress Committee president K. Praveenkumar will open the dharna. Action forum convener C.K. Abdurahiman told reporters here on Tuesday that as many as 333 employees of the Kerala Bank from various districts were affected by the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to release pensions. The Supreme Court had passed an order on August 24, 2022 for allotment of pensions to retired employees. While the Regional PF Commissioners in Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam have released pensions following the SC order, the Commissioner in Kozhikode denied pensions to 128 employees in Malappuram district. The employees have approached the High Court since then to get the SC order implemented and secured a favourable verdict on June 24, 2024, in which the Commissioner was asked to clear pensions of retired employees from Malappuram district within two months. However, the officer has refused to heed both the orders, Mr. Abdurahiman alleged. Members of the forum had visited the Commissioner several times with the demand, and he reportedly told them that he was not liable to do what the other Commissioners did. \u201cWe have paid our PF dividend throughout our career expecting a comfortable life post retirement. Now, we are forced to run from pillar to post for our rightful pensions,\u201d Mr. Abdurahiman said. Forum chairman M. Rajan said denying pensions to retired employees who had no other source of income was cruelty. Working chairman of the forum P.K. Moosakutty was present.

            "content": "Mysuru and Kodagu districts have been witnessing elephant-human conflicts and there have been many petitions to the government for addressing the issue. In this connection, Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, Mysuru and Kodagu MP, met Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupendra Yadav and requested him to consider large-scale rail barricading the forest borders to prevent elephants from entering farmlands, human habitations and thereby reducing conflicts and promoting coexistence. The MP told the Minister that elephant-human conflict has been on the rise, especially in Kodagu and there are reports of attacks on humans by elephants, resulting in injuries and also deaths. The movement of elephants into the coffee estates and agricultural lands causes crop losses due to damage and foraging by the elephants. To ensure that the movement of elephants is restricted to forest reserves, railway barricading has been proven to be an effective means to restrict the movement of elephants outside the forests. There is a need to implement this on a large scale along the forest borders and the agricultural lands bordering forests, the MP proposed. Given the border of the forests in his constituency stretching over 400 km with around 280 km of forest border requiring immediate barricading, the cost of such an exercise will reach \u20b9350-400 crore, Mr. Wadiyar said, in his memorandum. The MP urged the Forest Minister to request the Railway Ministry for the allocation of railway lines commensurate with the requirement. \u201cThe cost of the project would be limited to that of the labour cost of fitting the railway lines to form the barricade. If the proposal is acceptable to you, I will pursue the project with the Railway Ministry,\u201d Mr. Wadiyar said. The benefits of the initiative are manifold, from reduction of human casualties, protection of property and livelihood, to conservation of elephants and most importantly promoting human-elephant coexistence, which is the need of the hour, he opined.

Ever the politician with an eye on theatrical effect, he also sought early polls in the city.Clever politics or foolish overreach. The jury will be out on whether Kejrwial played his cards wisely or miscalculated the risk till elections, due in February, are held.But the 55-year-old, who tendered his resignation to Lt Governor V K Saxena on Tuesday after picking senior AAP leader Atishi as his successor in the post, is .",

            "description": "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been indicted on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges",
            "content": "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was due in court Tuesday (September 17, 2024) on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges that accuse him of hitting and abusing women for over a decade and presiding over an empire of sexual crimes. The music mogul \u201cengaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\u201d according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday (September 17, 2024). Detailing allegations dating to 2009, the indictment accuses him of abusing, threatening and coercing women for years \u201cto fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.\u201d Combs had been arrested late Monday in Manhattan, roughly six months after federal authorities conducting a sex trafficking investigation raided his luxurious homes in Los Angeles and Miami. Over the past year, Combs has been sued by people who say he subjected them to physical or sexual abuse. He has denied many of those allegations, and his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said outside the courthouse Tuesday morning that Combs would plead not guilty and that he would \u201cfight like hell\u201d to try to get his client released from custody. Of Combs, Agnifilo said, \u201cHis spirits are good. He\u2019s confident.\u201d The indictment accuses Combs of striking, punching and dragging women on numerous occasions, throwing objects and kicking them \u2014 and enlisting his personal assistants, security and household staff to help hide it all. The indictment describes Combs as the head of a criminal enterprise engaged in or attempting to engage in activities including sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, drug offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice. Combs, 54, was recognized as one of the most influential figures in hip-hop before a flood of allegations that emerged over the past year turned him into an industry pariah. In November, his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit saying he had beaten and raped her for years. She accused Combs of coercing her, and others, into unwanted sex in drug-fueled settings. The suit was settled in one day but months later CNN aired hotel security footage showing Combs punching and kicking Cassie and throwing her on a floor. After the video aired, Combs apologized, saying, \u201cI was disgusted when I did it.\u201d Combs and his attorneys, however, denied similar allegations made by others in a string of lawsuits. Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for Cassie, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cneither Ms. Ventura nor I have any comment.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate your understanding and if that changes, we will certainly let you know,\u201d he added. A woman said Combs raped her two decades ago when she was 17. A music producer sued, saying Combs forced him to have sex with prostitutes. Another woman, April Lampros, said Combs subjected her to \u201cterrifying sexual encounters,\u201d starting when she was a college student in 1994. The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie and Lampros did. Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, has gotten out of legal trouble before. In 2001, he was acquitted of charges related to a Manhattan nightclub shooting two years earlier that injured three people. His then-protege, Shyne, was convicted of assault and other charges and served about eight years in prison.

He was speaking after distributing financial assistance sanction documents worth \u20b915.32 crore to 847 families of the Dalit Bandhu second phase beneficiaries at Nagulavancha village in Madhira constituency of Khammam district on Tuesday. \u201cPeople\u2019s government has declared September 17 as People\u2019s Governance Day to mark liberation of Telangana State from tyrannical rule. The decision has been taken by drawing inspiration from the Indian Constitution and democratic spirit. Those who oppose the decision would mean they are against the Constitution and democracy,\u201d Mr Vikramarka said. He added that people\u2019s rule became a reality as a result of the struggle by several selfless people to free the State from autocratic rule. He said the implementation of farm loan waiver, crop insurance Rythu Bhima, subsidized power supply among a plethora of other schemes stands as a testament to the Congress government\u2019s commitment to fulfill all its promises. Referring to the growing demand for organic farm products, he called upon farmers in Chintakani mandal to focus on organic farming to augment their income. The government will extend all support to facilitate marketing of organic farm products, he asserted. The Deputy Chief Minister said the State government will soon install solar agricultural pumpsets. Siripuram village in Madhira constituency has been selected as the pilot project for installation of solar agricultural pumpsets. Plans are on the anvil to augment farmers\u2019 income by purchasing surplus power from the solar pumpsets. Loans will be provided to women Self Help Groups through banks for setting up of solar power generation plants and the government will in turn buy back the solar power thus generated, he added. He said the construction of Indiramma houses will be taken up soon.

As the road is widened, the underpass also needs to be widened and hence the closure.

Widening both of them is necessary to open six-lane traffic on the 4-km Malaparamba- Mavilikkadavu stretch of the NH. With the underpass closed, traffic on the route has been diverted through service roads and alternative roads. Buses plying from Kannadikkal to the city shall take the Paroppady-Malaparamba route. Those plying from the city to Kannadikkal shall take the Karikkamkulam- Florican Road route, take a left to the service road of the NH, and cross the highway to reach the service road on the opposite side to reach Kannadikkal Road.

            "content": "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president K. Surendran has sought clarity on the disaster relief funds provided by the Centre to Kerala in the past two years and the amount utilised before and after the Wayanad landslides. His demand comes against the backdrop of the controversy over the cost estimation of the response and relief steps after the tragedy, submitted to the High Court following a suo motu petition. Mr. Surendran pointed out on Tuesday that the government\u2019s claims were unbelievable because it had a history of lavishness in spending money and diverting funds from the Chief Minister\u2019s Distress Relief Fund. \u201cRehabilitation works in Wayanad are all messed up. The Chief Minister needs to clarify how much was the real expense and how much more is the expected cost. Just posting something on Facebook will not help. The State government is either trying to siphon off funds or attempting to fool the Centre,\u201d he said. According to media reports, the government claimed to have incurred an expense of \u20b92.76 crore for burying 359 bodies at the rate of \u20b975,000 a body. The other expenses include \u20b910 crore for food and water supply for volunteers and troops, and \u20b91 crore for the construction of a Bailey bridge. The government, however, has claimed that it was the estimated cost submitted to the Centre for getting financial aid. Mr. Surendran, however, was evasive when asked if the Centre had released any interim financial help to the State. He claimed that the Centre would release funds only after the State government\u2019s submission of expenses under various heads. The BJP leader also said that the State already had enough money for the rehabilitation works.

            "description": "Mr. Shinde was addressing a gathering at the Hutatma Memorial in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar on the occasion of Marathwada Liberation Day, marking the region\u2019s integration into the Union of India from Nizam\u2019s rule in 1948",
            "content": "Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday reaffirmed his government\u2019s dedication to advancing the drought-prone Marathwada region, stating that numerous projects valued at \u20b929,000 crore are currently in progress to ensure the area\u2019s development within a set timeline. He said that Marathwada is poised to play a pivotal role in the nation\u2019s overall progress. However, the Opposition alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) refuted the Chief Minister\u2019s claim, branding it as \u2018untrue.\u2019 Shiv Sena (UBT) leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, Ambadas Danve, even offered a reward of \u20b91 lakh to anyone who could prove such development work was actually underway. Mr. Shinde was addressing a gathering after hoisting the national flag at the Hutatma Memorial in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (previously Aurangabad) on the occasion of Marathwada Liberation Day, also known as Marathwada Mukti Sangram Din, marking the region\u2019s integration into the Union of India from Nizam\u2019s rule in 1948. The people of the region fought valiantly against the atrocities of the \u2018Razakars\u2019, the Nizam\u2019s private militia to merge the region into the Union of India. The Hyderabad State was annexed into India following military action, initiated by the then Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. \u201cThe state government is determined to develop Marathwada, and this region will contribute significantly to the nation\u2019s growth. To resolve the drought issues plaguing the region, we have initiated a \u20b915,000 crore project to redirect runoff water to the Godavari River. This water-linking initiative will change Marathwada\u2019s drought-stricken identity,\u201d Mr. Shinde said. He added that unlike the Konkan region, which receives substantial rainfall, or the prosperous western Maharashtra, Marathwada faces challenges, but the government is committed to addressing them. Last year the MahaYuti government held a special cabinet meeting in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar to address key issues facing Marathwada. However, no such plans were announced for this year. Among the measures being implemented is the connection of 200 religious sites along the Godavari River through the Ashta Shatabdi Marg, for which \u20b9234 crore has been allocated. In the past, development projects in Marathwada often stalled, Mr. Shinde alleged. \u201cIn 2023, we held a cabinet meeting here and initiated projects exceeding \u20b945,000 crore. We made 29 decisions and 26 declarations on September 16, 2023. Projects worth \u20b929,000 crore are in the final stages, while others are being executed.\u201d The state has allocated \u20b9829.13 crore for urgent development work, and \u20b945.13 crore has been sanctioned for the second phase of the Aundha Nagnath temple town in Hingoli, he said. \u201cMoreover, \u20b91,434 crore has been earmarked for development initiatives in Latur, Dharashiv, and Beed districts,\u201d Mr. Shinde added. He also acknowledged the significant role played by the people of Marathwada in the fight against Nizam rule, led by figures like Swami Ramanand Teerth. \u201cTo honour their efforts, \u20b9100 crore has been set aside for a memorial in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. We are focused on eradicating the region\u2019s underdevelopment,\u201d the Chief Minister said. Mr. Danve accused the government of making false statements and demanded a white paper on the announced projects. \u201cThe government had announced developmental works worth \u20b946,000 crore last year. Now, the CM says works of \u20b929,000 crore are underway. He should show where the work is underway. A cash of \u20b91 lakh will be given if any such work is found to be currently ongoing.\u201d Not a single work announced earlier is underway, he said, and added, \u201cI can give a list of the announcements. What the chief minister said here is false. The government should publish a white paper on these announcements.\u201d Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah greeted the people of the erstwhile Hyderabad region on the Liberation Day saying their fight will always be cited as a glorious manifestation of patriotism, where people led an uprising against the tyrant Nizam to be united with India. In post on social media platform X, in Marathi, Mr. Shah extended his greetings to the people of the Marathwada region on the occasion of Marathwada Liberation Day. \u201cToday we commemorate the struggle of the people of Marathwada who fought unitedly, overcoming the atrocities of the Nizams and Razakars. Salute to all the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the unity of the nation!\u201d he said.

            "content": "A labourer engaged in soil excavation near Neyyattinkara was trapped for over an hour in a soil slip on Tuesday. The incident took place around 12.30 p.m. at Padappithottam, near Anavoor, where a group of workers was excavating soil for a proposed processing unit. Shylan, a resident of Alathoor in Neyyattinkara, was delivering drinking water to the driver of a soil excavator when the surrounding loose soil collapsed on him. Initially buried up to his head, Mr. Shylan was partially freed by his co-workers and the police. However, it took about an hour and a half for Fire and Rescue Services personnel and the others to fully free his legs and rescue him. Mr. Shylan, who is believed to have sustained rib injuries, was initially taken to Neyyattinkara General Hospital and later referred to the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital for specialised treatment. The excavation work has been suspended at the project site for the time being, the police said.

            "content": "The South Central Railway (SCR), Vijayawada division, inaugurated the fortnight-long \u2018Swachhata Hi Sewa\u2013Swachhata Pakhwada\u2019 cleanliness campaign here on Tuesday. Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Narendra A. Patil administered the Swachhata Pledge to the officers and staff at the Clock Tower Centre at the East main entrance of the railway station and kicked off the campaign. The programme, \u2018Swabhav Swachhata, Sanskar Swachhata,\u2019 was part of the nationwide Swachh Bharat Mission and will culminate on October 2\u2014Gandhi Jayanti and Swachh Bharat Diwas, the DRM said. The officers and staff held an awareness rally from the clock tower to the Gandhi waiting hall on Platform No.1, passing through the DRM Office and the Jack and Jill High School. Mr. Patil and branch officers participated in a plantation drive and organised shramdaan (voluntary labour drive) at the South Parcel Office near the railway station. During the shramdaan, around 100 bags of garbage was collected. Speaking on the occasion, the DRM said 2024 marks the 10th anniversary of the Swachh Bharat Mission, and during the drive, the focus will be on cleaning railway tracks in urban and semi-urban areas, removing silt in drains, and cleaning other public spaces. He said about 500 cleanliness target units (CTUs) have been identified for the campaign, including long-neglected garbage points and areas that are difficult to clean. No polythene bags The DRM urged passengers not to use polythene bags and to use only biodegradable materials such as cloth, paper, and jute bags. It directed the officials to enforce the ban on single-use polythene bags. Later, the Bharat Scouts and Guides performed a \u2018nukkad natak\u2019 (street play) at the Mahatma Gandhi waiting hall, aiming to spread awareness about the ill effects of plastic. On the occasion, Srinivasa Rao Konda, the Additional Divisional Manager (Operations), and other officers distributed cloth bags to the passengers.

            "content": "Atishi is replacing Arvind Kejriwal as Delhi CM five months ahead of the crucial Delhi Assembly elections. Arvind Kejriwal today tendered his resignation from the post of Delhi Chief Minister while Atishi has been nominated for the post, the opposition got a chance to criticise the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Calling Atishi a \"Dummy CM,\" rebel AAP Rajya Sabha MP Maliwal said that Atishi's parents had written mercy petitions for Afzal Guru. \"Today is a very sad day for Delhi. Today, a woman is being made the Chief Minister of Delhi whose family fought a long battle to save terrorist Afzal Guru from hanging. Her parents wrote mercy petitions to the Honourable President to save terrorist Afzal Guru. According to them, Afzal Guru was innocent and was framed as part of a political conspiracy,\" Maliwal said in a post on X. While the work of Atishi as Delhi CM will be put to the test after five months when Delhi goes to the polls, here are five controversies linked to Atishi and her parents: Afzal Guru Mercy Petition Atishi's parents Tripta Wahi and Vijay Singh reportedly were part of the group that filed a mercy petition for Parliament attack convict terrorist Afzal Guru. Aam Aadmi Party's political opponents have used this to accuse her parents of supporting anti-national elements. Probe For Links With SAR Gilani In 2016, the Delhi Police reportedly questioned several DU Professors including Tripti Wahi for sharing the dais with SAR Gilani, another DU professor arrested under sedition and other charges. However, no actionw as taken againt Wahi. 'Vote For Goons' Ahead of the 2019 polls, during campaigning, Atishi was accused of asking the voters to vote for opposition candidates to defeat the BJP even if the opposition candidate was a goon/gunda. She drew flak for her remarks as well. \"In UP only the coalition of SP and BSP can defeat BJP. So if we were UP voters, what should we do, we should vote for the coalition no matter who is the candidate. I spoke to one of my known people from UP, and he told me that the candidate from our area is a goon, so what should we do? I said blindly go and vote for the coalition because this is an election where we need to defeat the BJP,\" said Atishi. Surname Row Atishi\u2019s full name used to be 'Atishi Marlena'. Several reports claimed that the surname was derived from Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. In 2018, she changed her name to just Atishi, drawing flak from the BJP. Gautam Gambhir Pamphlet Row During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Atishi ran against cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir in East Delhi. AAP alleged that Gambhir distributed defamatory pamphlets against Atishi, filled with personal insults and slanderous remarks. The controversy escalated into a major political spat, with Atishi breaking down during a press conference. Gambhir denied the allegations, calling it a political stunt by AAP.",

            "description": "A source close to Hezbollah says its members were targeted in the attack",
            "content": "Hundreds of people were injured across Lebanon when their pagers exploded Tuesday (September 17, 2024), Health Minister Firass Abiad said, with a source close to Hezbollah saying its members were targeted. The source close to Hezbollah said a large number of the Iran-backed movement's members had been injured in the near-simultaneous incidents, but that no deaths had been reported. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if people were killed. A senior military intelligence official and an official with a Lebanese group with knowledge of the situation, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said that pagers carried by Hezbollah members were detonated. The second official said it was believed to be an Israeli attack. The Associated Press reached out to the Israeli military, which declined to comment. Photos and videos from Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the group\u2019s members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes. Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry called on all hospitals to be on alert to take in emergency patients and for people who own pagers to get away from them. It also asked health workers to avoid using wireless devices. AP photographers at area hospitals said the emergency rooms were overloaded with patients, many of them with injuries to their limbs, some in serious condition. The state-run National News Agency said hospitals in southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs \u2014 all areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence \u2014 had called on people to donate blood of all types. The news agency reported that in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and other areas \u201cthe handheld pagers system was detonated using advanced technology, and dozens of injuries were reported.\u201d A Hezbollah official said that at least 150 people, including members of the group, were wounded in different parts of Lebanon when the pagers they were carrying exploded. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the explosions were the result of \u201ca security operation that targeted the devices.\u201d \u201cThe enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident,\u201d the official said, without elaborating. He added that the new pagers that Hezbollah members were carrying had lithium batteries that apparently exploded. Lithium batteries, when overheated, can smoke, melt and even catch on fire. Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars. Lithium battery fires can burn up to 590\u00b0C. The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas in Gaza. The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border.

            "content": "Hundreds of members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, including fighters and medics, were seriously wounded on Tuesday when the pagers they use to communicate exploded, a security source told news agency Reuters. Multiple media reported that the thousands of pagers exploded after receiving a \"cryptic message\". If the claims were true, it would be the most advanced warfare against the Hezbollah group. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military about the detonations. A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the detonation of the pagers was the \"biggest security breach\" the group had been subjected to in nearly a year of war with Israel. The explosions took place amid heightened violence between Israel and Hezbollah, who have been engaged in cross-border warfare since the Gaza war erupted last October in the worst such escalation in years. A Reuters journalist saw ambulances rushing through the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut amid widespread panic. Residents said explosions were taking place even 30 minutes after the initial blasts. The security source added that devices were also exploding in the south of Lebanon. Groups of people huddled at the entrance of buildings to check on people they knew who may have been wounded, the Reuters journalist said. Regional broadcasters carrying CCTV footage which showed what appeared to be a small handheld device placed next to a grocery store cashier where an individual was paying spontaneously exploding. In other footage, an explosion appeared to knock out someone standing at a fruit stand in a market area. Lebanon\u2019s crisis operations centre, which is run by the health ministry, asked all medical workers to head to their respective hospitals to help cope with the massive numbers of wounded coming into for urgent care. It said health care workers should not use pagers. Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced from towns and villages on both sides of the border by the hostilities.",

            "description": "Fish farmers who have prepared ponds, pen units, and enclosures are currently waiting for hatchlings and Fisheries department is yet to make them available, whereas farmers who breed the seeds are stuck with the hatchlings as the authorities are yet to procure them",
            "content": "While the State government has launched multiple schemes to attain self-sufficiency in fish seed production, aquaculturists across the State are facing a serious crisis due to the delay in procurement and distribution. Fish farmers who have prepared ponds, pen units, and enclosures are currently waiting for hatchlings and Fisheries department is yet to make them available. According to the farmers, if ranching is delayed any further, they will have to suffer huge losses as raising temperatures will impact the growth. Though they had submitted the applications much in advance, the department is yet to start supply. \u201cMany of such projects are currently in standstill, impacting our livelihood. There is no point in getting the seeds immediately before the summer months as there will be no water. Just like agriculture, fish farming too have a calendar and if we don\u2019t follow that, the result will be disastrous,\u201d says Purushothaman, an award-winning fish farmer from Kannur. Objectives The department had launched Backyard Fish Seed Production scheme in order to produce over 600 lakh seeds of pearl spot and murrel and provide livelihood to nearly 620 farmers. The other objectives of the project were to ensure availability of quality seeds and augment the aquaculture production by steady supply of seeds. \u201cI run a licensed hatchery producing pearl spot seeds for Janakeeya Matsya Krishi, the government scheme to expand inland fish farming. June, July, and August are the ideal months for ranching and this year the department has taken no step to procure them. They cite the delay in getting administrative sanction and currently we are stuck with the hatchlings,\u201d says Sivaprasad, a fish farmer from Alappuzha. At present his farm has over five lakh pearl spot hatchlings and maintaining them in good health costs over \u20b950,000 a month. Since the department is not procuring the seeds, the farmers are compelled to sell the seeds to farms in other States at a much lower price. The farmers had approached the authorities with a proposal saying they are ready to provide seeds so that the farmers can start stocking. \u201cThe department can fix a base price and pay us later. By doing that we can protect the livelihood of hundreds of farmers and those engaged in allied activities. But they have opted to ignore our plea,\u201d he adds. Department\u2019s stand According to department authorities, the district offices are unable to implement the project due to the lack of funds. \u201cThe department is implementing several projects, including brackishwater culture, shrimp farming, and cage culture. The delay will affect a section of farmers and seed producers. But it will be solved at the earliest and the farmers will not have to wait for long,\u201d said a senior official.

            "description": "Teen accounts will be for under 18 users to enhance safety and limit exposure to harmful content",
            "content": "Instagram is introducing separate teen accounts for those under 18 as it tries to make the platform safer for children amid a growing backlash against how social media affects young people\u2019s lives. Beginning Tuesday (September 17, 2024) in the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia, anyone under 18 who signs up for Instagram will be placed into a teen account and those with existing accounts will be migrated over the next 60 days. Teens in the European Union will see their accounts adjusted later this year. Meta acknowledges that teenagers may lie about their age and says it will require them to verify their ages in more instances, like if they try to create a new account with an adult birthday. The Menlo Park, California company also said it is building technology that proactively finds teen accounts that pretend to be grownups and automatically places them into the restricted teen accounts. The teen accounts will be private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to. \u201c\u2018Sensitive content\u2019, such as videos of people fighting or those promoting cosmetic procedures, will be limited,\u201d Meta said. Teens will also get notifications if they are on Instagram for more than 60 minutes and a \u201csleep mode\u201d will be enabled that turns off notifications and sends auto-replies to direct messages from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. While these settings will be turned on for all teens, 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to turn them off. Kids under 16 will need their parents\u2019 permission to do so. \u201cThe three concerns we\u2019re hearing from parents are that their teens are seeing content that they don\u2019t want to see or that they\u2019re getting contacted by people they don\u2019t want to be contacted by or that they\u2019re spending too much on the app,\u201d said Naomi Gleit, head of product at Meta. \u201cSo teen accounts are really focused on addressing those three concerns.\u201d The announcement comes as the company faces lawsuits from dozens of U.S. states that accuse it of harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. In the past, Meta\u2019s efforts at addressing teen safety and mental health on its platforms have been met with criticism that the changes don\u2019t go far enough. For instance, while kids will get a notification when they\u2019ve spent 60 minutes on the app, they will be able to bypass it and continue scrolling. That\u2019s unless the child\u2019s parents turn on \u201cparental supervision\u201d mode, where parents can limit teens\u2019 time on Instagram to a specific amount of time, such as 15 minutes. With the latest changes, Meta is giving parents more options to oversee their kids\u2019 accounts. Those under 16 will need a parent or guardian\u2019s permission to change their settings to less restrictive ones. They can do this by setting up \u201cparental supervision\u201d on their accounts and connecting them to a parent or guardian. Nick Clegg, Meta\u2019s president of global affairs, said last week that parents don\u2019t use the parental controls the company has introduced in recent years. Ms. Gleit said she thinks teen accounts will create a \u201cbig incentive for parents and teens to set up parental supervision. Parents will be able to see, via the family centre, who is messaging their teen and hopefully have a conversation with their teen,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there is bullying or harassment happening, parents will have visibility into who their teen\u2019s following, who\u2019s following their teen, who their teen has messaged in the past seven days and hopefully have some of these conversations and help them navigate these really difficult situations online.\u201d U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that tech companies put too much on parents when it comes to keeping children safe on social media. \u201cWe\u2019re asking parents to manage a technology that\u2019s rapidly evolving that fundamentally changes how their kids think about themselves, how they build friendships, how they experience the world \u2013 and technology, by the way, that prior generations never had to manage,\u201d Mr. Murthy said in May 2023.

            "content": "The Local Self Government Department (LSGD) has fixed strict norms for asset creation activities under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) after anomalies were noticed in the implementation in some cases. Asset creation activities including creation of farm ponds, waste management systems, wells or cattle sheds, in land owned by individuals should be done mainly for priority sections. The sections for which such activities can be taken up include Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, denotified tribes, Below Poverty Line families, households headed by women or physically challenged and beneficiaries of land reforms or other government housing schemes. Small scale farmers can also be considered after providing benefits to the above categories. However, it has to be ensured that their primary source of revenue is from agriculture. The grama sabha and the grama panchayat have to ensure that the beneficiaries chosen are deserving of the same. A work order with the details of the maximum amount of materials that can be used and the amount of funds to be provided from MGNREGS for the work should be given to the beneficiary before the work begins. The beneficiary also has to enter into a contract with the grama panchayat before the work begins. The gramapanchayat overseer/engineer has to monitor the asset creation activities and check whether the works are being carried out as per the estimate. Funds should be released only on completion of the work. Social audit reports have in the past highlighted instances of funds being released while the work remained incomplete. Action will be taken against the officials responsible in such cases. In the creation of public assets, some grama panchayats have been found to be handing over the works to contractors instead of providing the job to MGNREGS workers. All the works under MGNREGS should have the administrative sanction of the grama panchayat. Atleast 60% of the works should be in agriculture or allied activities.

            "content": "Miley Cyrus is being sued by Tempo Music Investments for alleged copyright infringement, claiming her song 'Flowers' bears striking similarities to Bruno Mars' 'When I Was Your Man'. Los Angeles: Singer-songwriter Miley Cyrus is facing a lawsuit over the alleged similarities between her track \u2018Flowers\u2019 and Bruno Mars' hit track \u2018When I Was Your Man\u2019. The lawsuit has been filed in a Los Angeles court, and was put in motion by Tempo Music Investments \u2014 which owns a share of the copyright in Mars' hit after it acquired songwriter Philip Lawrence's music catalogue, reports \u2018People\u2019 magazine. Tempo Music Investments has alleged that many \"recognised the striking similarities\" between the two songs upon the release of \u2018Flowers\u2019. The documents, accessed by \u2018People\u2019, state that \u2018Flowers\u2019 \"duplicates numerous melodic, harmonic, and lyrical elements\" of Mars' track. It read, \u201cIt is undeniable based on the combination and number of similarities between the two recordings that 'Flowers' would not exist without 'When I Was Your Man\u2019\u201d. \"Accordingly, Plaintiff brings this action for copyright infringement arising out of Defendants' unauthorised reproduction, distribution and exploitation of 'When I Was Your Man\u2019\u201d, the complaint added. As per \u2018People\u2019, Tempo Music Investments also listed \u2018Flowers\u2019 songwriters Gregory Hein and Michael Pollack, who wrote the track with Cyrus, among multiple defendants, along with Sony Music Publishing and Apple, in the suit. Mars is not named as a plaintiff in the filing. The investment platform claims in the documents that it acquired \"the copyright interests\" of Mars' hit, which was written by the singer, 38, Lawrence, 44, Ari Levine and Andrew Wyatt, \"in or around 2020\u201d. Among the accusations, the suit states that \"the opening vocal line from the chorus of 'Flowers' begins and ends on the same chords as the opening vocal line in the verse of 'When I Was Your Man\u2019\u201d. Tempo Music Investments wants Cyrus, and the defendants listed in the suit to stop reproducing, distributing or publicly performing \u2018Flowers\u2019.",

According to sources, Tamil Nadu State Parent-Teacher Association Secretary J. Angelo Irudhayasamy, will be in-charge until further notice. This comes in the light of the recent controversy where a spiritual talk was delivered by guest speaker Mahavishnu at the State Government Higher Secondary Schools at Ashok Nagar and Saidapet in Chennai. The speaker had humiliated a visually-challenged teacher during a talk in Saidapet school when the teacher had confronted him for preaching unscientific thoughts about past life. A video of Mahavishnu\u2019s argument with a differently abled teacher, had gone viral on social media. The principals of both the schools were also transferred. A committee headed by School Education Director S. Kannappan will submit a report on the inquiry conducted. Mahavishnu was arrested on September 7 and was booked under five provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including Sections 196(1)(a) (Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 352 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace); and 92 (a) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (Punishment for offences of atrocities.

            "content": "A rainwater harvesting project, undertaken by the Koduvayur grama panchayat, near here, has stumbled upon an unusually large number of megalithic urn burials on top of a hill in the Kollengode range of Nenmara forest division. An archaeologist who examined the urn burials found on Kundlikkad hill said that they could throw up a significant insight into the links between mesolithic and iron age periods in Kerala. Also known as Malampalla or Malappuram hill, Kundlikkad would not have captured the attention of archaeologists had a group of labourers not dug up 60-odd pits on the hill as part of the panchayat\u2019s rainwater harvesting project. \u201cIt is rare to find such exclusive urn burials on hilltops,\u201d said K. Rajan, archaeologist and professor of history at Government Victoria College, Palakkad. \u201cThe burials may go back to more than 2,500 years. But without excavation, we cannot date it for sure,\u201d said Dr. Rajan, examining the microliths found from the site. The microliths recovered from the urn burial site on Kundlikkad hill. Dr. Rajan has been surveying the links between mesolithic and iron age periods in the State. \u201cIn most hill sites, what we see are cairn heaps with cists and cairn circles and stone circles containing cists and dolmens. But on this hill, we could find an unusually large number of classic urn burials,\u201d he said. Several urns were broken as the labourers went at rain pits without being aware of the archaeological significance of the region. One of the urn burial has a capstone intact. Many pot sherds were found from the region indicating the presence of such pottery as black ware, red ware, and black and red ware. \u201cThe megalith builders had deposited huge urns having a thickness of 8 mm to 2 cm,\u201d said Dr. Rajan. The urn found in one of the pits had fingertip impressions on it. \u201cThe pot sherds of smaller pots bear cord impressed designs,\u201d said Dr. Rajan. \u201cThe chisel marks found on the rock at many locations of the hill indicate that the capstones and the circling boulder stones were made using chisels,\u201d he said. Calling for deeper studies, he said that although mesolithic tools were found in many sites in hilly areas, it was not possible to excavate a site where traces of both mesolithic and iron age occurred. \u201cAn excavation of the site can surely give us a stratigraphic sequence for both mesolithic period and iron age,\u201d said Dr. Rajan.

Terming the Special Status for Kalyana Karnataka under Article 371(J) of the Constitution as a game-changer, Mr. Khan said that the inclusion of Ballari, which was part of the Madras Presidency during the British rule, in Kalyana Karnataka region has opened the floodgates for development activities in the district.

            "content": "The Madhavaram Milk Colony police on Tuesday arrested a youth for allegedly murdering his friend after a quarrel in Manjambakkam near Manali. Late on Monday, the police received information that an unidentified body with injuries had been found on a vacant lot on Kosappur Road. The victim was identified as Joseph Dilip Kumar, 18, of Pazhaya Nappalayam in Manali New Town. Based on a complaint from his mother, the police investigated and learned that Dilip was last seen alive with his friend K. Jayam, 20, of Ennore. The police arrested and interrogated him. The investigation revealed that Jayam had borrowed Dilip\u2019s bike one-and-a-half months ago and had left it at the Thirumangalam Metro station. When Dilip insisted that Jayam return the bike, he was told that the bike had accrued a parking fee of \u20b97,000. At 11 a.m. on Monday, Dilip called Jayam over the phone and abused him over the bike. Later in the day, Jayam asked Dilip to meet him at Manjambakkam to discuss the bike issue. When they were drinking liquor, a quarrel broke out between them. Jayam hit Dilip on the head with a glass bottle and stabbed him three times with a knife. He then fled the scene. Jayam was later remanded in judicial custody. Published - September 17, 2024 07:33 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Heavy crowds Speaking to the media, Mr. Rao acknowledged that the town saw an influx of massive crowds due to the extended weekend holidays and the advent of Puratasi month, which is considered auspicious for those in Tamil Nadu.

            "content": "The process of appointing guest faculty in Bharathiar University (BU) for the 2024-25 session has got delayed by close to three months, much to the discomfiture of the several hundreds of students pursuing PG programmes. Unlike in the past when the process was completed in time such that the guest faculty could start handling classes from July, this time around, the last date for receiving applications from the candidates for appointment of guest faculty is September 27. Going by the advertisement put out by the university in its website, 81 guest faculty have to be appointed in 23 university departments and five guest faculty in the university\u2019s Post Graduate Extension Centre at Erode in two departments. According to senior professors, the delay was avoidable, as the Higher Education Secretary had given a go ahead to the appointment process well in time. In deference to a point raised by the Higher Education Department last year, the university had, this time, nominated representatives from the Syndicate to the Dean\u2019s Committee early on to decide upon the requirement of guest faculty department-wise. The guest faculty are appointed to vacant posts only for 10 months, and are reappointed after \u2018no-pay\u2019 duration of two months. However, the old guest faculty are given preference, it is learnt. With the first semester scheduled during November, the students are apparently struggling without proper teaching-learning exposure, in the absence of the guest lecturers, for certain papers. The number of guest lecturers every year is decided based on the retirement vacancies and start of new programmes. This year, the university had to increase the number of guest faculty to 81 from around 60 last year owing to the start of two new programmes in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, sources said. To tide over the situation, the university has been hiring faculty on hourly basis. However, the measure does not suffice as the faculty hired on hourly basis have nothing to do with internal assessment, valuation of papers and guiding students to conduct seminars, a senior professor pointed out. Citing the continuing stalemate in appointment of a regular Vice-Chancellor, the professor emphasised that the Higher Education Department has a responsibility to step in and sort things out to ensure that such a situation does not recur in the appointment of guest faculty for the 2025-26 session. There are all-round concerns that the standing of the university in the NIRF rankings would take a beating, otherwise.

Work on Yaddalli-Kachuru Lift Irrigation Project in Sedam taluk of Kalaburagi district will begin soon. The State government is also taking steps to develop an economic corridor between Bidar and Bengaluru to boost economic development of Kalyana Karnataka,\u201d he said. He was speaking after hoisting the national flag to mark Kalyana Karnataka Utsav in Kalaburagi on Tuesday. \u201cA total of 44 multi-village drinking water supply schemes are being implemented at a total cost of \u20b98,290 crore to supply piped water to 2,283 villages across Kalyana Karnataka. The State government has allocated \u20b9100 crore for constructing 400 community toilets in the region.

Accusing the previous BJP-led government of financial mismanagement and corruption, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that the BJP government took up projects worth crores of rupees without allocating funds in the budget. \u201cMoreover, the BJP-led Central government has denied the State\u2019s rightful share. Despite all these challenges, our government has implemented guarantee schemes effectively and is providing \u20b95,000 crore annually to Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board (KKRDB),\u201d the Chief Minister said.

The pioneering move aims to address the infrastructural challenges faced by educational institutions in forest regions and marks a significant step towards ensuring access to quality education for tribal children. The government has committed itself to setting up similar schools in two or three other locations where construction of permanent buildings is not possible. Speaking at the event, Minister Seethakka noted that the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)\u2019s regulations prevent the construction of permanent buildings for government schools in forest areas in the wild life sanctuaries. In response to this challenge, the government has opted for container-based schools to provide educational facilities in these regions, she added. \u201cThe previous government led by the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) had left the education system in disarray, leading to the closure of hundreds of government schools. We are committed to reversing this trend by improving the education system,\u201d Seethakka said. She added that new welfare schemes, as pledged by Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, are being introduced to ensure that they reach the deserving beneficiaries.

The Flag Satyagraha was a major event in the struggle for freedom from the British. The architecturally unique monument, built at Maddur, 25 km from Mandya and on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway, is in a neglected State. The soudha lacks basic infrastructure and security arrangements. Congress MLC Dinesh Guli Gowda, who was elected from the local bodies constituency in Mandya district, had urged the Chief Minister, who also holds the Finance portfolio, to sanction funds for the renovation of the monument. Mr. Siddaramaiah has directed Finance Department officials to release \u20b92 crore for undertaking development works to restore the grandeur of the monument. Students and tourists have not been visiting the monument owing to poor maintenance, Mr. Guli Gowda said in a letter to the Chief Minister. The monument is a symbol of patriotic fervour. Following a call by Mahatma Gandhi, a large number of people from the Old Mysore region participated in the satyagraha at Shivapura in 1938 to assert the right to hoist the national flag, defying British rule. Hoisting the national flag was banned by the British rulers then. To commemorate the historic event, the State government constructed the soudha and it was opened on September 26, 1979. It was built under the guidance of a trust headed by former Chief Minister late Kengal Hanumanthaiya.

            "content": "Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and raised the \u201cextremely objectionable\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d statements made by members of the ruling alliance, including a Union Minister, against Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. Wishing Mr. Modi on his birthday, the Congress chief urged him to \u201cdiscipline\u201d the leaders who made provocative speeches against Mr. Gandhi. Mr. Kharge said strict legal action should be taken against them so that \u201cIndian politics can be prevented from degenerating and nothing untoward happens\u201d. \u201cI want to draw your attention to an issue which is directly related to democracy and the Constitution. You must be aware that a series of extremely objectionable, violent and rude statements are being made against the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi,\u201d the Congress chief said. \u201cI have to say with sadness that the violent language used by the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and your allies is harmful for the future. The world is shocked that the Minister of State for Railways in the Central government, a Minister from BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh are calling the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha \u2018number one terrorist\u2019,\u201dMr. Kharge said, referring to the remarks by MoS, Railways, Ravneet Singh Bittu and Uttar Pradesh Minister Raghuraj Singh. \u201cAn MLA from a party that has ties with your government in Maharashtra is announcing a reward of \u20b911 lakh to the person who \u2018cuts off the tongue of the Leader of the Opposition and brings it to him\u2019. Another BJP leader and former MLA in Delhi is threatening to make him (meet the) \u2018fate like his grandmother\u2019,\u201d he said. While Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad had announced that he will give \u20b911 lakh to anyone chopping off Mr. Gandhi\u2019s tongue, Delhi BJP leader Tarvinder Singh Marvah had said that the leader would meet the same fate as former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was assassinated by her bodyguards. Mr. Bittu on Sunday (September 15, 2024) said that if those \u201cmanufacturing bombs\u201d were supporting Mr. Gandhi, then he is the \u201cnumber one terrorist\u201d. Mr. Singh had echoed Mr. Bittu. Mr. Kharge said Indian culture is known throughout the world for non-violence, harmony and love, and such \u201ctalk of violence has got the Congress workers agitated and worried\u201d. \u201cDue to such hate-mongering forces, Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, and Rajiv Gandhi had to sacrifice their lives. This political behaviour of the ruling party is an example of rudeness in democratic history,\u201d Mr. Kharge said, adding, \u201cI request and expect you to please impose discipline and decorum on your leaders\u201d. \u201cInstruct them to behave properly. Strict legal action should be taken for such statements so that Indian politics can be prevented from degenerating. Nothing untoward happens. I trust that you will take the required action to immediately stop these leaders from making violent statements,\u201d the Congress leader added.

            "content": "The Central government should address issues related to raw materials used by the textile industry, said S.K. Sundaraman, chairman of the Southern India Mills Association (SIMA). In a press release issued by the Association on Tuesday after its annual meeting, the SIMA said the government should come out with a Technology Mission on Cotton (TMC) to increase cotton production and productivity and address the inverted duty structure for manmade fibre (MMF). The government had announced a special package last cotton season to encourage indigenous seed technology for high density planting of cotton crop, improve agronomy practices, and to promote cultivation of extra long staple cotton. The phase one of trial projects in these areas saw 30% to 60% increase in productivity and phase II trials were progressing. At a recent meeting with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Coimbatore, the Minister assured the industry that steps would be taken to address the MMF value chain inverted duty structure issue in GST. Though it was addressed in 2022, it was reversed due to opposition from a section of the industry, he said. Mr. Sundararaman, Managing Director of Shiva Texyarn, was re-elected chairman of SIMA at the annual meeting. Durai Palanisamy, Executive Director of Pallava Textiles, Erode, was re-elected deputy chairman and S. Krishnakumar, Managing Director of Sulochana Cotton Spinning Mills, Tiruppur, was re-elected vice chairman of the Association for 2024-25. At the annual meeting of the SIMA Cotton Development & Research Association (SIMA CD & RA) held on Tuesday, Mr. Sundararaman, Mr. Palanisamy, and Mr. Krishnakumar were elected its chairman, deputy chairman, and vice chairman, respectively.

            "content": "Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas has said the Tourism department will organise a \u2018tribal cultural festival\u2019 this year to promote tourism in Wayanad by highlighting the cultural and ethnic heritage of the place. Interacting with a group of social media influencers, including vloggers and bloggers, at Mananthavady while launching an official video of the department Ente Keralam Ennum Sundaram , Mr. Riyas said Wayanad had a special place on the tourism map owing to its immense possibilities for adventure tourism and balmy weather. \u201cOutside Kerala, the campaign will take off under the tagline It\u2019s Kerala Season ,\u201d he said. As part of the campaign, more than 30 social media influencers would visit major tourism destinations in the district and create content that would help highlight the unique features of the landscape and scenic beauty of Wayanad. They would generate video content for social media. The hospitality industry had witnessed large-scale booking cancellations after the landslides in Wayanad. Wayanad was also the first destination chosen for the Safe Kerala campaign launched after the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the aggressive campaign, the picturesque district became a top destination and due to the heavy rush getting rooms on weekends in many resorts was difficult. However, it lost its advantage after the tragedy. The influencers from southern India reaffirmed their support for the tourism activities of Wayanad to realise its potential.

            "content": "Nagarkurnool MP Mallu Ravi has come down heavily on Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) MLA Padi Kaushik Reddy, criticising his recent statements targeting Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy. The Congress senior leader condemned the remarks, describing them as irrational and provocative. In a statement on Tuesday, Mallu Ravi said that Kaushik Reddy\u2019s claim that Mr. Revanth Reddy had visited his residence and fallen at his feet, requesting to be made TPCC chief, was a baseless and absurd assertion. \u201cSuch comments reflect that Kaushik Reddy has lost his mental balance. No one who knows Revanth Reddy would believe such claims. He is a leader who never surrenders and has risen through the ranks with integrity,\u201d Mr. Ravi stated. Mallu Ravi lauded Mr. Revanth Reddy as a leader with a strong sense of self-respect, who has climbed the political ladder from ZPTC member to MLC, MLA, TPCC working president, MP, and now Chief Minister, without ever pursuing positions for personal gain. \u201cRevanth Reddy didn\u2019t chase after roles. Positions came to him through movements and his leadership abilities,\u201d he added. Mr. Ravi also accused Mr. Kaushik Reddy of indulging in \u2018provocative politics\u2019 aimed at creating unrest in Telangana. Citing the case of MLA Arikerpudi Gandhi, he alleged that Mr. Kaushik Reddy\u2019s actions had led to conflicts in the past and warned of dire consequences if such provocations continued. \u201cThe BRS leadership must control Mr. Kaushik Reddy before the situation escalates further. If the party leadership doesn\u2019t take action, they will have to bear the responsibility for the consequences,\u201d Mr. Ravi warned.

            "content": "On the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s 74th birthday, Raj Bhavan, Goa, launched several initiatives, including Prachin Vriksha Ayurvedic Chikitsa , Vriksha Poshana Yoga, and Vriksha Pooja , special projects to preserve centuries-old trees through Ayurvedic treatments. The initiative launched by Governor P.S. Sreedharan Pillai focuses on reviving seven fruit-bearing trees over 100 years old that are showing signs of decay. These trees, including mango, tamarind, jackfruit, mahogany, and banyan, are receiving traditional Ayurvedic treatments to restore their health and extend their lifespan. These efforts focus on conserving ancient trees on the 90-acre Raj Bhavan estate, which is home to a rich biodiversity of flora, including trees estimated to be 500 years old. Mr. Pillai\u2019s initiatives have transformed the campus into a sanctuary for plants, including the creation of the jackfruit garden, sandalwood tree garden, and Aushadi Vatika , a Raj Bhavan statement read. The Vaman Vriksha Kala Udyan , featuring over 1,000 potted trees, is now the largest public sector bonsai collection in the country. Meanwhile, Governor Pillai stressed the importance of preserving these ancient trees using traditional methods, stating, \u201cTree worship and treatment are being done together for the health and longevity of the trees. Maintaining old trees is vital for the welfare of the state, and this project showcases the benefits of tree therapy.\u201d In addition to the Ayurvedic treatments, prayers and religious ceremonies were held at Raj Bhavan\u2019s chapel, temple, and gaushala to mark Mr. Modi\u2019s birthday, during which Chief Minister Dr. Pramod Sawant and Minister Aleixo Sequeira were present. The tree treatments involve a three-phase process, using over 15 Ayurvedic herbs applied through a combination of embelia ribes, brown rice, milk, soil, and bio-water, to rejuvenate the ageing trees. Mr. Sawant urged the people to support the preservation of heritage trees, recognising it as a unique and meaningful initiative.

            "content": "Hansal Mehta explains why he cast Kareena Kapoor Khan in 'The Buckingham Murders'. Mumbai: Filmmaker Hansal Mehta, who is receiving a lot of positive response to his recently released theatrical film \u2018The Buckingham Murders\u2019, has shared why he chose Kareena Kapoor Khan to essay the lead in the film. The director told IANS that Kareena has the perfect balance of acting prowess and star power but the actor in her is often overshadowed by her star power, and it\u2019s solely because of the audience\u2019s perception. He told IANS, \u201cKareena is a star with tremendous enduring appeal. I have always looked beyond that and seen her as a fine actor whose acting prowess has been overshadowed by her glamour. I wanted to subvert that glamour and explore Kareena the actor and I was thrilled when she agreed to do the film. What a fine actor she is. And a terrific collaborator on set\u201d. The film sees Kareena essaying the role of a tough cop who is on a hot pursuit of a murder of a kid in a neighbourhood while she battles her personal demons. The film also stars celebrity chef Ranveer Brar, who plays the role of the murdered child\u2019s father, Ash Tandon, Ranveer Brar, and Keith Allen. 'Faraz', 'Scam' and now \u2018The Buckingham Murders\u2019, he seems to be enjoying working in thrillers, of late. While he has acclaimed dramas like 'Shahid', 'Aligarh', 'Scoop', what is it about thrillers that appeals to the storyteller in him? Hansal said, \u201cI made a film called \u2018Chhal\u2019, released in 2002. In my opinion it was a very slick and cool thriller that did not get its due then. Maybe subconsciously I keep wanting to make that genre. But I do not see films as thrillers alone - I do films for the story and its characters. The world I can explore, the people I can discover and how these truths can be unfurled through a mysterious tale\u201d. The film also marks a new journey for Kareena as a producer after successfully completing 25 years in the industry. This is Kareena\u2019s 5th collaboration with Ektaa R. Kapoor after \u2018Veere Di Wedding\u2019, \u2018Crew\u2019, \u2018Jaane Jaan\u2019 and \u2018Udta Punjab\u2019. Presented by Balaji Telefilms, the film is produced by Shobha Kapoor, Ektaa R Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Mahana Films and TBM Films.",

            "content": "Airport charges are an important element of the commercial aviation ecosystem for infrastructure development and increase in airfares is not linked to a rise in the charges, according to the Airports Council International (ACI). Airport charges are an important element of the commercial aviation ecosystem for infrastructure development and an increase in airfares is not linked to a rise in the charges, according to the Airports Council International (ACI). Against the backdrop of the International Air Transportation Association (IATA) flagging concerns over a steep rise in airport charges, ACI also said that the charges will remain a critical source of revenue for airports. \"Airport charges are an important element of the commercial aviation ecosystem for infrastructure development. Failing to address the capital expenditure requirements to accommodate the projected growth could have serious socio-economic consequences,\" Stefano Baronci, Director General, ACI Asia Pacific & Middle East, said. In a statement, he noted that airports are highly infrastructure-intensive businesses, with their cost structures dominated by significant fixed costs for the operation and upkeep of essential infrastructure such as runways, taxiways, aprons, parking stands and terminal buildings. As many as 133 airport operators, operating 624 airports from 47 countries/ territories are members of ACI in the APAC & Middle East. Indian airport operators and Airports Authority of India (AAI) are also part of the grouping. Last week, IATA Director General Willie Walsh said that countries should be careful around airport charges and it has concerns about airport charges in a number of countries. \"India needs to be congratulated for the investment in infrastructure in recent years which will pay dividends but only if costs are controlled. At the moment, we continue to be concerned around the very significant increase in airport charges in India...,\" he had said. In India, tariffs for major airports are approved by the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) and in recent times, charges at some airports have gone up. IATA represents around 330 airlines, including Indian carriers, that account for over 80 per cent of the global air traffic. Meanwhile, ACI's Baronci said the increase in airfares is not linked to a rise in airport charges. \"The impact of airport charges on consumers (passengers) is very small to negligible. The full basket of airport charges collectively represents only 5.1 per cent of the base airfare and ancillary fees,\" he added. As per ACI's long-term forecasts, air traffic in the Asia Pacific region is projected to reach 8 billion by 2042 from 3 billion today. Also, it is the fastest-growing region with a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.8 per cent, surpassing the global CAGR of 4.3 per cent. Over the next two decades, 9 out of the top 10 fastest-growing aviation markets will be in the Asia Pacific region, with India being the second fastest-growing market, according to the grouping. \"Airports are highly infrastructure-intensive businesses, with their cost structures dominated by significant fixed costs for the operation and upkeep of essential infrastructure such as runways, taxiways, aprons, parking stands, and terminal buildings. As passenger numbers continue to grow, these fixed costs become even more critical to address,\" Baronci said. India is one of the fastest-growing civil aviation markets in the world and has 157 operational airports, heliports and waterdromes.",

            "content": "According to a report, the 31-year-old woman was tormented by numerous daily blank calls. In a bizarre incident from Japan, a man was arrested for making over 100 silent phone calls to his wife daily over several weeks. His motivation? Jealousy. The unsettling episode, which occurred between July and August, has drawn attention due to the strange behaviour exhibited by the husband. Continuous Harassment Through Silent Calls According to a report by the Japanese media outlet Kobe Shimbun, the 31-year-old woman was tormented by numerous daily blank calls. Every time she answered the phone, there would be silence on the other end. The constant harassment caused her considerable distress, prompting her to approach the police. Despite voicing her concerns to her husband, he dismissed the matter, offering no assistance. Unveiling the Truth As the calls continued, the woman began to notice a curious pattern. The silent calls would cease whenever her husband was asleep, playing video games, or spending time with her. This irregularity raised her suspicions, leading her to investigate further. One day, while out shopping together, the woman kept a close eye on her husband's behavior. She noticed that he didn\u2019t touch his phone all day, and during that time, the nuisance calls stopped completely. This discovery only deepened her suspicion that her husband was behind the harassment. Police Investigation and Arrest After gathering her observations, the woman reported the matter to the police. Upon reviewing the husband\u2019s phone records, the police confirmed that he had been making the blank calls under private mode, attempting to mask his identity. A thorough investigation revealed no prior conflicts or domestic issues in the couple's relationship. However, the motive behind this unusual behavior was eventually uncovered \u2014 jealousy. The husband admitted to being upset over his wife talking to other men, and he resorted to making blank calls as a form of punishment. The Consequences of Jealousy One particular incident escalated the husband's jealousy when he overheard his wife on the phone with another man, though he was unaware of the nature of the conversation. This moment triggered his obsessive behavior, leading him to bombard his wife with silent calls. In Japan, making nuisance calls is considered illegal due to the psychological distress it can inflict on the victim. Offenders can face up to one year in prison or a fine of up to 1 million yen (approximately $7,000 USD), alongside a potential prohibition order.",

The Lankan Lions have made two changes to the team that defeated England in the third and final Test match of the recently concluded series at the latter's home. The hosts have called in two spinners - Ramesh Mendis and Prabath Jayasuriya in their team for the Galle Test of the two-match series. Ramesh is making a return after more than a year, having last played a Test match in July 2023. Jayasuriya played the first two Tests against the Three Lions but was not picked for the third one with Sri Lanka going for an all-pace attack. The pace battery will be led by Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara, both of who played pivotal roles with the ball in Sri Lanka's 8-wicket win over England at The Oval. Meanwhile, Oshada Fernando will have to wait for his chance in the batting order. Fernando was called into the squad after his match-winning knocks for Sri Lanka A against South Africa A in an unofficial Test match. Meanwhile, Kamindu Mendis is set to get a promotion to No.5 after a stellar start to his Test career. Mendis has hit seven scores of over fifty in his six-match career so far. Mendis has turned out to be a savour for the Lankan Lions several times when the top-order fails to perform. , who did not perform well in the England Tests, is still in the Playing XI but is set to bat at No.7. Notably, Sanath Jayasuriya, the interim coach of the team, had confirmed that Chandimal will move to No.3 as he won't keep the wickets. \"Chandimal took up the gloves and played in the middle order for the sake of the team, but he won't be keeping in this Test, which means he will move up to number three. Whoever takes up the gloves will bat in the lower middle order,\" Jayasuriya told media.

            "content": "India and the UK are expected to hold the next round of talks for a proposed free trade agreement in October to resolve the pending issues and close the negotiations, a senior official said on Tuesday. Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said the officials of the UK are briefing their new ministers about the proposed free trade agreement (FTA). The two sides have already taken stock of the progress of talks at secretary and minister levels. \"The briefings are going on in the UK...they are briefing their new ministers and based on that, the negotiations will start. We are hoping that in October, the negotiations should resume,\" Barthwal told reporters here. He also said India is progressing on all FTAs, but there are certain things which are not in control of anyone. The India-UK talks for the proposed FTA began in January 2022. The 14th round of talks stalled as the two nations stepped into their general election cycles. Due to the elections in India and Britain, both countries lost that period. There are pending issues in both the goods and services sectors. The Indian industry is demanding greater access for its skilled professionals from sectors like IT and healthcare in the UK market, besides market access for several goods at nil customs duty. On the other hand, the UK is seeking a significant cut in import duties on goods such as scotch whiskey, electric vehicles, lamb meat, chocolates and certain confectionary items. Britain is also looking for more opportunities for UK services in Indian markets in segments like telecommunications, legal and financial services (banking and insurance). The two countries are also negotiating a bilateral investment treaty (BIT). There are 26 chapters in the agreement, which includes goods, services, investments and intellectual property rights. The bilateral trade between India and the UK increased to USD 21.34 billion in 2023-24 from 20.36 billion in 2022-23. The Labour Party's election manifesto for the recent polls also committed to clinching the deal. A virtual meeting between Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and Jonathan Reynolds, UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade was held on July 11 to discuss next steps on the pact. Talking about the trade agreement with Australia, the secretary said that the two sides are looking at ways to conclude the negotiations before December. He added that chief negotiators of both sides are meeting on the pact, besides the trade ministers. India and Australia implemented an interim pact, officially dubbed as Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) in December 2022 and now are in negotiations to expand its scope. He added that FTAs are long-term negotiations as these are comprehensive in nature involving over 20 chapters. \"They are time-taking. But I must say that we are moving forward on all our FTAs except Canada. We had paused (that). All other FTAs are progressing very well,\" he said. The bilateral trade has dipped to USD 24 billion in 2023-24, from about USD 26 billion in 2022-23. On India-Bangladesh's proposed Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), the secretary said there are some problems in the neighbouring country as of now. \"So we are waiting and watching and we will look at it,\" he said. The bilateral trade declined to USD 12.91 billion in 2023-24, from about USD 14.23 billion in 2022-23. CEPA is a kind of free trade agreement, under which two trading partners significantly reduce or eliminate customs duties on the maximum number of goods traded between them. Besides, they ease norms to promote trade in services and investments. Further, the commerce ministry informed that the ninth round of negotiations between India and the European Union (EU) for a proposed FTA is planned for September 23-27 here. During this round, both sides will discuss core tarde issues covering goods, services, investment and government procurement along with necessary rules such as rules of origin, SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary), and technical barriers to trade. \"Also, the concerns of Indian stakeholders regarding the EU's sustainability measures, such as CBAM, deforestation and others, will be discussed with the EU,\" the ministry said. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) or carbon tax (a kind of import duty) will come into effect from January 1, 2026. It will initially be imposed on seven carbon-intensive sectors, including steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and hydrocarbon products. According to the think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) would hit India's agricultural exports worth USD 1.3 billion to the EU starting December 2024.

            "content": "The filming of the fourth season of Netflix's popular show 'Bridgerton' has officially begun. On Monday, streaming giant Netflix shared the first glimpse of the cast on Instagram. The post read, \"Please wake up for Sophie Beck and Benedict Bridgerton!!! Here's your first official photo of Yerin Ha and Luke Thompson on the set of Bridgerton Season 4. Now officially in production.\" Hello's Yerin Ha will play Sophie Beck, a maid who hides a mysterious history. Luke Thompson will be seen reprising his role of Benedict Bridgerton. On joining the show, Ha said, \"What attracted me to Sophie was that she immediately has obstacles in front of her, something she constantly has to overcome. Whether it's battles over social status or trying to hide her feelings from Benedict.\" Hints at 'new beginnings' Bridgerton's second-oldest sibling Benedict has no interest in settling down -- until he meets a glamorous Lady in Silver (as book fans know her, Sophie) at his mother's masquerade party, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The show's third season, which aired this summer with Nichola Coughlan and Luke Newton's love story in the forefront, broke records as one of the streaming service's most-watched shows ever. Showrunner Jess Brownell told The Hollywood Reporter in June that there would be a two-year wait before season four airs. \"We're trying to release the seasons as quickly as possible, but they take eight months to film and then they have to be edited, and then they have to be dubbed into every language,\" he said. \"And the writing also takes a very long time, so we're on a two-year pace, we're trying to pick up the pace, but somewhere in the same range.\" Season 4 of Bridgerton is set to have eight episodes. Adapted from the books by Julia Quinn and produced by Shonda Rhimes' master company Shondaland, the drama also stars Claudia Jessie, Golda Rosheuvel, Adjoa Andoh, Ruth Gamel and Jonathan Bailey.",

Now, developing countries need more than USD five trillion.

Rohit stressed it a couple of times in the pre-match press conference ahead of the series opener against Bangladesh in Chennai that the team's focus is to win and not what the opposition is saying or thinking as he conveyed that in his usual witty style on Tuesday, September 17. \" (Everyone wants to beat India. They get a kick out of beating India. Let them have fun),\" Rohit said when asked to react to his opposite number Najmul Hossain Shanto's remarks. \"Our job is to try and win and not to think about what the opposition is thinking about us. When England came here, a lot was said in press conferences and stuff but we didn't focus on that. How do we win games and get closer to positive result was important for us. And that will be our main target yet again and not think about the team we are playing against,\" Rohit added. The video of his response can be (from 17:55). Shanto, a day before Rohit's presser said that Bangladesh will try to win both Test matches as the team is confident after what they did in and against Pakistan. Rohit, on the other hand, said that every match played for the country is important regardless of the opposition when asked if this series was a dress rehearsal for the Australian tour. \"At the end of the day, you are playing for your country. So, there's no dress rehearsal kind of stuff happening here,\" Rohit said. \"Every game that we play is important and every game becomes important because what is at stake. World Test Championship table is still quite wide open and you want to win every game. It doesn't matter where we play in two months' time, we want to win here, we want to win this Test match.\" The two-match Test series will kick off on September 19 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.",

            "content": "To address the problem of frequent blockages in underground drainage pipelines, Coimbatore Corporation has deployed Combi Recycler, a high-capacity suction and jetting vehicle with a water recycling system, designed for efficient sewer and manhole cleaning. The Corporation has rented the Combi Recycler from Pune based Aryan Pumps & Enviro Solutions Private Limited at \u20b964,300 a day, for a 30-day period. A senior official from the Corporation\u2019s engineering department explained, \u201cThe Combi Recycler\u2019s integrated system separates water from sludge, allowing the water to be recycled for continuous use during jetting, thus eliminating the need for freshwater refills.\u201d \u201cThis machine significantly reduces water consumption and labour needs during long-duration sewer cleaning. It is particularly effective in addressing severe blockages in sewer pipes and chambers of Coimbatore Corporation\u2019s Central Zone wards, where the system, which is around 30 years old, suffers from almost 70% clogging. The use of this advanced equipment helps prevent the need for manual scavenging, which is both unsafe and inefficient, by providing a more effective and automated solution to clear the pipes,\u201d the official said. He further added, \u201cOur existing jetting machine requires 7,000 litres of freshwater to clean just four chambers. With the Combi Recycler, the water is now saved.\u201d The vehicle was deployed on an emergency basis, following numerous complaints from residents in Sanganoor and Rathinapuri regarding frequent blockages. Corporation Commissioner Sivaguru Prabakaran said, \u201cPurchasing one of these vehicles costs around \u20b93 crore to \u20b94 crore, and maintaining it adds further expenses. We opted to rent it first to evaluate its effectiveness, and if necessary, we will consider purchasing one in the future.\u201d Published - September 17, 2024 06:36 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "This year\u2019s edition of the Thazhathangadi boat race on the Meenachil river in Kottayam will be held on October 6. The annual regatta is organised by the Kottayam West Club in collaboration with the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC), Kottayam municipality, and Thiruvarp grama panchayat. Competitions will feature various categories of boats, including chundan (snakeboats), and different grades of churulan, veppu, and iruttukuthi. Works are on to put in place a remote start system, photo-finish technology, racecourse track markers, and facilities for spectators on both sides of the river. Dating back to 1887, the Thazhathangadi boat race is one of Kerala\u2019s oldest and most prestigious events. It was first launched through the efforts of the then Diwan Peshkar T. Ramarao, with sponsorship from the Travancore royalty. While the race was previously part of the Champion\u2019s Boat League (CBL), this year it will be held independently as the government has decided to cancel the CBL following the July 30 Wayanad landslides.

            "description": "Heritage activist Mudar Patherya is single-handedly cleaning up tombstones, that have become illegible over time, at Kolkata\u2019s South Park Street Cemetery",
            "content": "Mudar Patherya is bringing the dead back to life in one of India\u2019s oldest colonial-era burial grounds. This well-known heritage activist of Kolkata is single-handedly getting tombstones, undecipherable over time, cleaned at the South Park Street Cemetery in order to restore a part of the city\u2019s past. The cemetery, now run by the Christian Burial Board, opened in 1767 and, after being closed briefly in 1790, remained in use until the 1850s. Here lie buried several people who have a prominent place in Indian history, such as Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, Sir William Jones, Col. Robert Kyd, Lt. Col. Colin Mackenzie, and Maj. Gen. Charles Stuart. \u201cThis is possibly the richest repository of funerary architecture outside Europe. So far, I have been able to get 392 tombstones cleaned, there are 300 to 400 more that need to be cleaned, for which I need to raise more funds,\u201d Mr. Patherya told The Hindu . It all began a month ago when someone from a WhatsApp group on Urdu that he is part of told him about a particular tombstone \u2014 tombstone no. 1331 \u2014 that had an inscription in Urdu. He wondered why the gravestone of a British man should have an inscription in Urdu, and he went to the cemetery to take a look. The grave turned out to be that of British politician Samuel Smith. \u201cWhen I saw the tombstone closely, I also saw inscriptions in English and Bengali. I thought I must clean this up. I wrote to the Christian Burial Board for permission; they called me for a meeting and asked me if I could clean up other tombstones too,\u201d Mr. Patherya said. The Board, according to him, has been \u201cextremely receptive and cooperative\u201d, as a result of which things moved very fast: it was only last month he approached them for permission and he has already cleaned 392 tombstones after having quickly raised \u20b94 lakh through donations from well-wishers. When he set out for the job, he found that there was no documentation and no cleaning done, possibly for decades, and that structures above the graves were in danger. \u201cBut what was amazing was the sense of beauty \u2014 the beauty of the structures, the beauty of calligraphy and the sense of emotion. You have the graves of two-year-olds there. If you aggregate the stories written on the tombstones, you get a slice of life lived from 1767 to the 1850s, when the cemetery started filling up,\u201d Mr. Patherya said. One of the nearly 1,600 graves in South Park Street Cemetery is that of Rose Whitworth Aylmer, whose family packed her off to India because she was getting too close to the poet-writer Walter Savage Landor. She died in Calcutta, at the age of 20, almost immediately after her arrival, and Mr. Landor wrote a poem in her memory, which became one of his best-known works and which was later inscribed on her gravestone. Mr. Landor never got the fame he deserved, but he had admirers who went on to attain immortality. One of them was Robert Browning; another was Charles Dickens, who had named his second son after Mr. Landor. By a strange coincidence, the mortal remains of that son of Mr. Dickens \u2014 Walter Landor Dickens \u2014 lie buried in the same cemetery.

            "description": "Meeting to discuss modalities for weather-based insurance scheme for rubber plantations to be included in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana takes up issues from crop loss to climate change, experience of insurers, and demands of rubber producers and users",
            "content": "The first meeting of a recently constituted panel of experts to explore the modalities for weather-based insurance scheme for rubber plantations to be included in the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana saw opening discussions on issues from crop loss to climate change, experience of insurers, and demands of rubber producers and users. The meeting was held at the Rubber Board headquarters in Kottayam on August 30. The Rubber Board will provide data on weather-related crop loss and furnish with a synopsis of demand from rubber growers and the industry. The insurance companies will share their international experience of coverage of the crop. The panel of experts was constituted by the board on instructions from the Union Commerce Ministry. This is the first time the Centre is extending a comprehensive insurance cover for plantations like rubber. Farmers are keen to see how the proposed scheme improves on the present scheme operated by the State government, says Babu Joseph, general secretary of the Consortium of Rubber Producer Societies. He says the Central scheme can benefit the farmers with more lenient rules governing the payment of insurance money. For example, the insurance cover now offered under the present weather-based scheme operated by the State government provides \u20b910,000 a hectare. The scheme also stipulates a specific window of time during which the losses are incurred by the farmer. However, the current weather conditions are unpredictable. The current year has seen prolonged periods of drought-like conditions and heavy rain during the month of August. Kerala has around eight lakh rubber farmers, most of them operating small holdings. Acreage under rubber, once around 12 lakh hectares, has come down and rubber production touched the highest figure at 8.5 lakh tonnes. The current year may see a fall in production. Unpredictable weather patterns, triggered by climate change, have had a serious impact on rubber plantations. One of the most visible results of climate change has been a circular leaf spot detected from 2018. The disease has spread to most parts of rubber plantations in the State but production level has been kept up thanks to active involvement of the Rubber Board helping farmers take prophylactic action, says a researcher.

            "content": "The Kamakshipalya police have arrested a rowdy sheeter who had stripped a man, assaulted him, recorded a video of the act, and uploaded it on social media. The accused Pavan alias Kadubu, 28, was arrested after the police shot him in the leg, after he allegedly attacked a police officer resisting arrest on Tuesday morning. Pavan, a rowdy sheeter with over 12 criminal cases pending against him, had assaulted the man now identified as Nagarjuna, on Sunday night. Pavan forced Nagarjuna to strip on the road and assaulted him, over a trivial row. He recorded the act and the video had gone viral, prompting the police to launch a probe. Nagarjuna also has criminal cases pending against him and had not approached the police. However, the police identified him and recorded his statement, before registering a case against Pavan. A probe revealed that on Sunday night, Pavan had also assaulted another youth Vishwas. The Kamakshipalya police located the accused at his hideout in Ullal, based on his mobile tower location. A police team led by inspector Subramani K. surrounded the building and asked Pavan to surrender. However, in a bid to escape he allegedly attacked head constable Venkatesh with a knife and tried to flee. Mr. Subramani claimed to have opened fire at the left leg of the accused to stop him from fleeing and arrested him. While the accused Pavan is being treated at a private hospital, Mr. Venkatesh is being treated at a private hospital.

            "content": "Mist uncovers a verdant expanse, revealing a serpentine stream winding through the lush landscape. As Arivu\u2019s soothing narration begins, we are treated to a breathtaking aerial view of Akkamalai, known as the roof of Anamalai. \u201cHere, the sway of the grass, the breath in my chest, the movement of mist, the warmth in your blood, the rumbling storm echoing against the crown of Akkamalai,\u201d Arivu narrates, his voice a stark contrast to the high-octane hip-hop numbers we\u2019re accustomed to. Here, it captures the serene beauty and tranquillity of the mountains. This is how the introduction of Mudhuvar , the third short film part of The Pollachi Papyrus\u2019s docuseries on the wildlife and the native tribes of Anamalai, transports us into the heart of the indigenous Mudhuvar tribe and their harmonious coexistence with the Nilgiri Tahr. Through Arivu\u2019s poetic narration, we delve into the intertwined lives of the Mudhuvar and the Nilgiri Tahr, the state animal of Tamil Nadu. \u201cDuring my research for Project Nilgiri Tahr, I was exploring the ecological role of the Nilgiri Tahr and the justification (of State Government) investing 25 crores in its conservation. I discovered that the Tahr plays a unique role in the ecosystem, feeding on 125 different species of herbs and grasses that other herbivores avoid. This helps maintain the health of the mountain ecosystem and ensures the flow of rivers,\u201d says Pravin Shanmughanandam, one of the founding members of The Pollachi Papyrus and a co-director of the film. \u201cOur association with the Tamil Nadu Forest Department, which launched a conservation project for the Nilgiri Tahr, allowed us to access exclusive footage of this endangered species and its habitat. We integrated this footage into our film to highlight the crucial role of the Mudhuvar community and the Nilgiri Tahr in maintaining the ecosystem\u2019s health,\u201d he adds. The first film in the series, Kadar , explored the resilience of Loganathan, a native tribal person who lived peacefully in his landscape despite encountering a destructive elephant. This film underscores the harmonious coexistence between indigenous communities and wildlife, a relationship often overlooked in conservation discussions. Still from \u2018Mudhuvar\u2019| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement The second film, Malasar , shifted the focus to the mahout-elephant bond in the Anamalai Tiger Reserve. Actor Nassar lent his voice to Malasar , significantly enhancing its reach. Pravin acknowledges the invaluable contributions of Nassar and Arivu to the docuseries. \u201cTheir belief in the stories we were telling and their willingness to lend their voices pro bono added a significant layer of depth and authenticity to our films,\u201d he says, \u201cNassar Sir\u2019s suggestion of the line \u2018Nee verum pagan alla, yaanai-yin oru baagam\u2019 (you are not just a mahout; you are a part of the elephant) in Malasar perfectly captured the essence of the mahout-elephant bond. And Arivu\u2019s personal experience with the migration of his grandmother and his commitment to preserving cultural heritage resonated with the Mudhuvar \u2018s message.\u201d While Pravin envisions expanding the docuseries to include more films and potentially a feature-length documentary about Anamalai, he emphasises a patient and organic approach. \u201cOur storytelling process is unhurried. We avoid rushing into projects with preconceived ideas. Instead, we let the stories unfold naturally and focus on what resonates with us,\u201d he says, \u201cNext, we\u2019re considering branching out from Anamalai to explore other regions and tribes, such as the Kani and Kurumba. We\u2019re looking for narratives that may not be immediately noteworthy but have the potential to be engaging.\u201d Mudhuvar is streaming on The Pollachi Papyrus YouTube channel Published - September 17, 2024 06:24 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Coimbatore / documentary films / The Hindu MetroPlus",

            "description": "Members of the sexual harassment redressal committee of the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce assert parallel fast-track enquiry after a female choreographer alleges harassment by Jani master",
            "content": "A day after the news of a zero First Information Report (FIR) was registered against choreographer Shaik Jani Basha, aka Jani Master, on allegations of sexual assault, representatives of the sexual harassment redressal panel constituted by the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce convened a media interaction in Hyderabad on Tuesday (September 17, 2024). The move came following a few television and social media outlets revealing the identity of the survivor, against the guidelines of the Supreme Court. The 21-year-old female choreographer had lodged a complaint at the Raidurgam police alleging sexual assault by Jani master. Report of sexual harassment redressal panel within 90-days K L Damodar Prasad, honorary secretary of the redressal committee, along with actor and chairperson Jhansi, and members including producer-director Tammareddy Bharadwaja, producer Vivek Kuchibhotla, actor Pragathi Mahavadi, social worker Ramalakshmi Medapati and advocate Kavya Mandava, addressed the media. The panel said that a parallel investigation by the committee is on a fast track, alongside the police investigation, and a report will be filed within 90 days. The sexual harassment redressal panel was constituted in 2018 following allegations of sexual harassment made by actor Sri Reddy. Damodar Prasad and Jhansi revealed that this case of the 21-year-old choreographer came to light after she first approached two prominent television networks, who redirected her to the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce (TFCC). Her initial complaint pertained to being denied a membership card from the dancers\u2019 union despite paying a fee of \u20b96.5 lakhs. \u201cHer initial concern was the possibility of being denied work opportunities if she was not issued the card. Further investigation by TFCC revealed the alleged sexual harassment as the reason for the denial,\u201d said Ms. Jhansi. The redressal panel, which includes producer Supriya Yarlagadda, Jhansi and others, learnt that the issue was more grievous than initially surmised. \u201cThe survivor was a minor (aged 16) when the alleged assault began. We guided her to take the legal route since it is tough to provide her the recourse within the framework of workplace harassment guidelines in an unorganised sector such as the film industry,\u201d Ms. Jhansi said. Sub-committee report yet to be published In June 2022, a report was submitted to the then State Government of Telangana by a sub-committee formed under a High-Level Committee appointed by the State government, after conducting detailed inquiries with stakeholders in the industry, to formulate guidelines to make the workplace safer for women. The report is yet to be published. Representatives of the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce, along with members of the support group Voice of Women and the sexual harassment redressal panel, have been in talks with the State government to take the report forward and help formulate guidelines for the film industry. In the meantime, the redressal committee has been abiding by the the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (PoSH) to address complaints. An interim order has been issued by the enquiry committee to restrain the male choreographer - who is the president of Telugu Film and TV dancers and Dance Directors Association (TFTDDA) - from performing duties as the president until the enquiry is complete. The police had earlier stated that choreographer Jani was booked under clause (2) and (n) of section 376 (rape), criminal intimidation (506) and voluntarily causing hurt (323) of the IPC. The producers and actors on the panel emphasised that efforts are on to ensure that the survivor is not ostracised by the industry. \u201cShe is a talented choreographer who is now working on a few big-budget productions, and the producers concerned and a popular actor have expressed support for her,\u201d Jhansi stated.

            "content": "Condemning BJP leader H. Raja\u2019s remarks against Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, party functionaries staged a demonstration here on Tuesday. The protesting functionaries accused Mr. Raja of referring to Mr. Gandhi as anti-national and alleged that the BJP leader was attempting to spread violence in the country. The BJP leader has no right to talk about their leader who is the future Prime Minister of the country, they added. Mr. Raja\u2019s remarks on Rahul Gandhi had hurt not only the Congress, but the people of the country as well, the protesters said, and demanded that he apologise for his remarks. Mr. Gandhi, whose father Rajiv Gandhi had sacrificed his life for the country, comes from a family of martyrs, the cadre said, and added that it was the BJP that had sold the country to a handful of industrialists and cheated the people who voted for them.

            "content": "Calls for sanction of funds to complete the long-pending 2-km link road from Muttam Bridge to Radhanallur Road have intensified. Despite proposals totalling \u20b920 crores being submitted to the State government, the link road remains incomplete, forcing commuters to use the narrow Vakkaramari village road. The Muttam Bridge, located in Manalmedu near Kattumannarkoil, acts as a vital connection. Built over the Kollidam, the bridge reduces the travel distance by 50 km between Kattumannarkoil and districts such as Mayiladuthurai, Thanjavur, and Nagapattinam, eliminating the need for a detour via Chidambaram. \u201cThe absence of a proper link road on the Mayiladuthurai side has led to increased traffic through Vakkaramari village, causing frequent accidents and inconvenience to residents,\u201d said social activist A. Appar Sundaram. \u201cThis situation defeats the bridge\u2019s intended purpose of providing a safe and direct route for commuters.\u201d In 2010, during the DMK government, \u20b943 crore were sanctioned through NABARD for the construction of the bridge. The project began in 2011 and was completed by October 2014. Although vehicles began using the bridge, the crucial link road remains unfinished. Officials are expecting a fund allocation soon to finally complete the much-needed link road and enhance connectivity in the region.

            "content": "Union Minister of State for Home and former Telangana party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar said the Congress government need to explain to the people about why it has been unable to implement the promised six guarantees during the Assembly elections to the people. At a press conference here at the State office on Tuesday, he claimed that while the Modi government has many achievements to show in its first 100 days in power in the third term, the Congress government here could not fulfil the promises even after being in power for the last nine months. \u201cPeople are not going to forget this and will surely punish the government,\u201d he asserted, while giving a detailed account of the Modi government initiatives, almost repeating what Mr. Kishan Reddy had earlier explained at another press meet at the Parade Grounds. Earlier, at the official function to mark the Telangana Liberation Day, he said it was \u2018sad\u2019 and \u2018unfortunate\u2019 that the State government has been refusing to celebrate the event and this was due to \u2018vote bank politics\u2019. \u201cWhatever we talk, a communal tinge is given but we are not against Muslims. There were stalwarts like Sheikh Bandgi, Shoebullah and others who fought against the Nizam,\u201d he said. He had a word of praise for former MLC Guduru Narayana Reddy for making the \u2018Razakar\u2019 movie through which the \u2018real history\u2019 of the sustained freedom struggle from the Nizam was known to present generation. It is for the same reason the Modi government has taken the decision to celebrate the Liberation Day officially and thanked PM, Home Minister Amit Shah and senior colleague Mr. Kishan Reddy for their role. \u201cThe Telangana armed struggle was not against any group or religion but a people\u2019s movement against the despotic rule of the Nizam and his anti-people policies plus freedom from slavery. People cutting across caste, creed and religion took part in the freedom struggle. We cannot forget the crimes committed against the people by the Nizam\u2019s forces,\u201d he said and added that the Centre is ready to cooperate if the government celebrates the liberation day.

The city, which turned 153 years old on September 16, 2024, has a population of 4.98 lakh. Aimed at increasing revenue and for administrative reasons, seven village panchayats were proposed to be included in the Corporation limits. They were Elavamalai \u2013 8,388 population, Kadirampatti \u2013 3,827, Koorapalayam \u2013 2,500, Mettunasuvampalayam \u2013 17,240, Pichandampalayam \u2013 4,553, 46 Pudur \u2013 16,054 and Lakkapuram \u2013 9,739. These panchayats spread across 56.09 sq km and have a population of 62,301 as per Census 2011. A corporation official told The Hindu that expanding the jurisdiction is necessary since residential plots have come up in large numbers on the outskirts. A new bus terminal is being constructed at Solar Punjai Lakkapuram while an integrated vegetable and grocery market is to come up near the terminal. Also, expansion is needed to bring in new development projects for overall growth, the official added. The proposal was opposed by residents in these panchayats as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) will not be implemented in the corporation limits. They also fear that the merger would lead to an increase in various taxes which they could not afford to pay. \u201cA public hearing meeting would be held to seek the opinion of people for the merger,\u201d an official said. It is recalled that the five-year term of elected representatives in village panchayats ends in December this year.

            "content": "In a significant political development, Arvind Kejriwal has announced Atishi as his successor for the role of Delhi Chief Minister. The decision was made during a meeting of the legislative party on Tuesday, where Kejriwal proposed Atishi's name, which was met with unanimous approval. Atishi, known for her dynamic and influential leadership, will now take over the reins of Delhi's governance. Arvind Kejriwal's choice of Atishi as his successor comes after careful consideration of several prominent names within the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), including Saurabh Bharadwaj, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, and Rakhi Birla. The decision underscores Kejriwal's confidence in Atishi's capabilities and her established track record in Delhi's political landscape. Atishi has long been considered one of Kejriwal's most trusted and close associates. Her association with Kejriwal dates back to the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement, and she has been a steadfast supporter of the AAP's mission. Her rise from a legislator to a minister in just five years highlights her dedication and competence. She first won the election from the Kalkaji constituency in 2020 and later joined Kejriwal's Cabinet in 2023. During the Delhi liquor scam case, when both Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia were imprisoned, Atishi took charge of the party's operations. She managed the responsibilities of governance and party organisation in their absence, effectively countering opposition challenges and maintaining party morale. Atishi was the only female minister in the Kejriwal Cabinet and played a significant role in advocating for women's issues within the party. Her contribution to the education sector, particularly during Sisodia's imprisonment, was notable. She successfully managed the education ministry and upheld the standards set by her predecessors. Atishi's experience in organisation and administration is extensive. Known for her assertive approach, she has a solid track record in handling both political and administrative responsibilities. Despite losing the 2019 Lok Sabha election in East Delhi to BJP's Gautam Gambhir, she continued to be a prominent figure in the party, eventually securing a legislative seat in the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections. In the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections, Atishi contested from the Kalkaji constituency in South Delhi, where she won by defeating BJP candidate Dharmvir Singh with a margin of 11,422 votes. Following the resignations of Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Health Minister Satyendar Jain, Atishi, along with Saurabh Bharadwaj, was inducted into the Delhi government as a Cabinet Minister. Her political journey has been marked by considerable highs and lows. Atishi's election as Delhi's Chief Minister marks a new chapter for the Aam Aadmi Party, with high expectations from her leadership to continue the party's initiatives and address the challenges faced by the city.",

            "content": "Sri Lanka take on New Zealand in a two-match Test series in Galle, starting Wednesday, September 18. Sri Lanka, even though lost the series, had their moments during three Test matches in England and even won the third and final game at the Oval, which was only their fourth victory in the format in the country. A spirited Sri Lankan side rose a couple of spots to fifth place in the World Test Championship points table and will be keen to continue with the momentum. New Zealand, on the other hand, lack match practice given what happened last week in Greater Noida. The one-off Test against Afghanistan would have been a great precursor for the long Test season in Asia for the Kiwis, however, with the rain washing out all five days, the visitors would be feeling a bit underdone against a strong Sri Lankan side, especially at home. New Zealand though too have a solid side at their disposal for the two-match Test series against Sri Lanka but their overseas record has been nothing to write home about. The Kiwis are the only side not to win an overseas Test series in the World Test Championship history and would want to change that in at least one of the two upcoming assignments against Sri Lanka and India.

            "content": "HYDERABAD Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and MLC Bomma Mahesh Kumar Goud lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), stating it had no moral right to comment on Telangana\u2019s merger with India. Addressing a gathering after garlanding Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s statue and hoisting the national flag on National Integration Day, which commemorates Hyderabad State\u2019s merger with Independent India, Mr. Goud emphasized the pivotal role of Congress in the integration of princely States like Hyderabad. \u201cIt was Congress that secured India\u2019s independence and integrated princely States such as Hyderabad. BJP has no moral right to discuss Telangana\u2019s history or its merger,\u201d Mr. Goud remarked. Urging people to reject divisive politics, he questioned whether Telangana should fall prey to BJP\u2019s communal agenda or choose the welfare-driven approach of Congress. \u201cRahul Gandhi has always stood for ensuring that those in need receive their due, and under Chief Minister Revanth Reddy\u2019s leadership, we will implement welfare policies of Congress in Telangana,\u201d he affirmed. Mr. Goud also strongly criticised Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) president and former Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), accusing him of betraying the aspirations of Telangana during his decade-long rule. He highlighted the Congress\u2019s plan to install a long-overdue statue of Telangana Talli at the Secretariat, announcing its unveiling on December 9. Further, Mr. Goud praised the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for his contributions to modern India, particularly in the IT sector and for reducing the voting age to 18. He accused BRS working president and Sircilla MLA K.T. Rama Rao (KTR) of disregarding Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s legacy, despite his education and exposure. Senior Congress leaders, including former MP V. Hanumantha Rao, MLA Danam Nagender, MLC Balamuri Venkat and DCC President Rohin Reddy were present at the event.

            "content": "Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament Captain Brijesh Chowta has sought the arrest of former President of the Bantwal Town Municipal Council Mohammed Sharief and Councillor of Bantwal Council Hussainer who challenged VHP activists , which led to tensions during the Eid Milad rally at B.C. Road, near Bantwal, on Monday (September 16, 2024). Talking to reporters after donating blood at the blood donation camp organised by the District BJP Yuva Morcha on the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 17, 2024, Capt. Chowta said the duo had been accused of spreading an inflammatory voice message of Sharief challenging the VHP South Karnataka Joint Secretary Sharan Pumpwell to block Eid procession on B.C. Road.

The government should act and arrest the two persons, who are responsible for the tension that prevailed in B.C. Road on Monday, he said. Captain Chowta said the two accused are reportedly involved in illegal extraction of sand in Bantwal. \u201cThe Congress government seems to encourage those involved in illegal sand extraction,\u201d he said and added that he would continue to press for effective action against illegal sand extraction, which is harming the ecology of the region. Government should also effectively deal with those involved in illegal possession and sale of narcotic drugs in the district, he said. District BJP chief defends Sharan Pumpwell District BJP President Satish Kumpala spoke in defence of VHP leader Sharan Pumpwell and said the latter did not not say anything inflammatory during the Ganesh Chaturthi function. \u201cIn response to the Nagamangala incident, he only said of the possibility of blocking the procession of Muslims.\u201d Strongly condemning the act of Mr. Sharief challenging Mr. Pumpwell, Mr. Kumpala said the VHP was right in holding \u2018Bantwal Chalo\u2019 programme on September 16 and sending a strong message to those who posed the challenge. Holding the Congress government responsible for the turmoil presently created in Dakshina Kannada, Mr. Kumpala said district in-charge Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao should immediately intervene and cool down raging tempers. Mr. Kumpala defended Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharath Shetty\u2019s statement seeking a ban on the Eid procession and said the MLA has stood by persons aggrieved by actions of Mr. Hussainer and Mr. Sharief.

Durg-Visakhapatnam Vande Bharat Train Flagged Off: Durg-Vishakhatpatnam Vande Bharat Express train was flagged off virtually on Monday from the Raipur railway station by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Loco pilot J D Navrengay said that the train journey will commence from Raipur and culminate in Vishakhatpatnam and that it is hundred percent safe. \"It is a matter of pride for the nation that PM showed green signal to the train and its peculiarity is that it runs 160 kms per hour. Also, unless all the doors of the train are closed, the engine will not start. The train will cover the distance from Durg to Vishakhatpatnam in merely eight hours while the local train used to take eleven to twelve hours to complete the journey,\" he said. \"Durg -Vishakhatpatnam Vande Bharat Express train is very special as it will take the passengers within eight hours to their destination. It is very clean and hygenic and runs at a very fast pace. The train's speciality lies in the modern facilities it offers,\" the loco pilot added. School children were taken on board the train and they seemed quite enthusiastic on their maiden journey on board the Vande Bharat train. One student Diksha Sahu travelling by the train for the first time said she was very happy to sit in the train. She said the train is truly unique as it is very neat and clean and there are also good arrangements for the passengers in the train. \"I have travelled by local train but this is something special. My friends are accompanying me. Highly excited to be on board the train. It is a never felt before experience. The train is different from other local trains,\" she said. School principal Bhushan Paragniya said the train would be a boon for intercity travellers given that it would reduce travel time greatly. \"Glad that Vande Bharat train will run from Durg to Vishakhatpatnam. It will be convenient for the travellers who will reach their destination in a short time. The train is special as it is equipped with modern facilities and if more trains are run Chhattisgarh will progress faster,\" he said. \"Along with the school children, I am too in high spirits to use the train service. If more Vande Bharat trains are run, Chhattisgarh will witness rapid growth,\" he added. The flagging off ceremony was attended by Chhattisgarh Governor Raman Deka, Union Minister Tokhan Sahu, Member of Parliament Brijmohan Aggarwal, MLAs Purender Mishra and Khushwant Saheb.",

Asked after the game as to what went wrong for the Stallions, Haris said, \" [(There wasn't any mistake. We did what we wanted to do. We were checking the team's strength).\" \" (In the first match, we won the toss and chose to bat. Today, we chased, so that we could check and understand our strength. That\u2019s exactly what happened. We\u2019re happy that we lost),\" he said. The response was a bit bizarre given it was coming from a captain, whose team had just lost. The social media too was confused as to what he really meant. Stallions were in second place despite the loss with Markhors at the top. However, with the Panthers winning against the Lions on Monday, September 16, they climbed to second place are just behind the Markhors on net run rate.",

            "content": "Touching new heights, the Sensex on Tuesday rose by nearly 91 points to close at a fresh lifetime high of 83,079.66, while the Nifty settled above the 25,400 level for the first time in a range-bound trade. The record rise comes amid firm global trends ahead of the much-awaited US Fed's decision on interest rates. It is for the second consecutive day that Sensex has hit new records while closing. The 30-share BSE Sensex climbed 90.88 points or 0.11 per cent to settle at a lifetime high of 83,079.66. It is for the first time that the key index has settled above the 83,000 level. During the day, it rose by 163.63 points or 0.19 per cent to 83,152.41, falling a bit till closing. Meanwhile, the NSE Nifty gained 34.80 points or 0.14 per cent to settle for the first time above 25,400 at 25,418.55 - its record closing high. Among 30 Sensex firms, Bharti Airtel, Kotak Mahindra Bank, NTPC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Titan, ICICI Bank, Larsen & Toubro, Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Unilever and Reliance Industries were the biggest gainers. Among biggest laggers were Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Adani Ports, JSW Steel, ITC and Asian Paints. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services reacted to the record-making gains and said, \"The Indian market exhibited a subtle positive momentum, driven by the anticipation of a rate cut cycle by the US FED. Although a 25-bps cut is largely factored in, the market remains attuned to the FED's comments on the health of the economy and the future trajectory of rate cuts.\" Regarding Nifty, Ajit Mishra \u2013 SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd said that after a flat opening, the Nifty moved within a narrow range with realty and auto shares witnessing gains while metal and pharma ended in the red. Meanwhile, in a big relief, wholesale inflation fell for the second consecutive month to 1.31 per cent in August due to cheaper vegetables, food and fuel, government data released on Tuesday showed.

            "content": "India edged past the hosts China 1-0 in the Asian Champions Trophy final in Hulunbuir on Tuesday (September 17, 2024). It was the record-extending fifth Asian Champions Trophy title for India. India and China played some excellent hockey throughout the final. In the first three quarters, both the teams went without scoring any goals. It was not easy for the favourites and Paris Olympics bronze medallist as they failed to break the Chinese defence in the first three quarters. Congratulations to the Indian Men's Hockey Team on clinching their record-breaking 5th Asian Champions Trophy title! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfd1 With a hard-fought 1-0 victory over China, India have not only retained their crown from 2023 but also solidified their position as the most successful team... pic.twitter.com/akCC5N6kGv At the 51st minute, it was captain Harmanpreet Singh\u2019s pass to Jugraj who converted and put India in the lead. China pushed hard at the Indian goalline to equalise but it went futile. Indian players held their nerves and never allowed China to score the equaliser. Before this, China\u2019s only appearance in the final of an international tournament was in 2006 Asian Games, where they finished second-best after losing 1-3 to Korea. Earlier in the day, Pakistan defeated Korea 5-2 to bag the third spot in the six-team competition. India started the contest as favourites, having defeated China 3-0 in their opening league game, but the final turned out to be a very close affair. After a fiercely contested 50 minutes of non-stop action, India finally broke through the deadlock with a crucial strike from Jugraj Singh, making it 1-0. That lone goal was all it took to secure the victory, and with it, the title! Congratulations to the entire squad for their... pic.twitter.com/JPAdHQcogA It was a keenly-contested battle between the two sides in the first two quarters, even though India had better scoring chances. The Chinese defended deep and troubled their rivals with brisk counter attacks. Raj Kumar Pal had the first shy at the goal for India but his effort was saved by Chinese goalkeeper Wang Weihao. Raj Kumar recovered well enough and earned India\u2019s first penalty corner in the 10th minute with some brilliant stick work, which resulted in another set piece but skipper Harmanpreet was off target with the second try. Two minutes later, Nilakanta Sharma saw a sharp save from Wang and then, the Chinese goalkeeper showed brilliant reflexes to deny Sukhjeet Singh after being fed by Jugraj. Seconds from the end of the first quarter, India conceded a penalty corner but Krishan Bahadur Pathak was alert in front of the goal. The script was the same in the second quarter with India enjoying most of the possession and China relying on counters. India pressed for goal in the face of a brilliant display of deep defending from China. The hosts didn\u2019t panic, and stayed calm when put under pressure by the Indians. In the 27th minute, Sukhjeet Singh secured a penalty corner but Harmanpreet\u2019s attempt hit the post, as China did enough to hold India goalless at half time. The nimble-footed Chinese came out with renewed vigour after the change of ends, mounting a series of attacks on the Indian citadel. China secured their second penalty corner in the 38th minute but the Indians defence was up to the task. The Chinese continued their aggressive intent, earning back-to-back penalty corners in the 40th minute but India goalkeeper Pathak was alert under the bar. The young Indian forwardline, which produced a fine performance in the tournament, too had its chances and penetrated the Chinese defence on a number of occasions but failed to find the target. It required a brilliant burst from Harmanpreet to finally break the deadlock. The in-form India captain sneaked into the Chinese circle with some fine stick work and neatly passed the ball to fellow defender Jugraj, who pushed it in past the opposition goalkeeper, as India heaved a sigh of relief. With the home crowd backing them, China withdrew their goalkeeper for an extra field player four minutes from the hooter, but the Indians managed to keep the ball in their control and defended in numbers to emerge triumphant.

            "description": "From pinwheels to illuminated lamps, architect-artist Ankon Mitra\u2019s origami art installations at Kalakriti Art Gallery, Hyderabad, surprise viewers with a new look to historical maps",
            "content": "A series of deep blue circular structures greet visitors at the entrance of Kalakriti Art Gallery in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad. The installation is part of Map Unfolded, a showcase of artworks by architect, sculptor and origami artist Ankon Mitra , curated by gallery owner, Prshant Lahoti. The installation features illustrated maps of the constellations in the Milky Way galaxy. Viewed from the other end, it reveals the many moons of the solar system. A few feet away, illuminated lampshades bear printed images of old maps of Hyderabad, Kolkata, Goa, Mumbai and Chennai. When Prshant, who has an enviable repository of maps, proposed the idea of artworks inspired by maps, Ankon was game. He explains, \u201cAn artist might create something on a blank canvas whereas an architect like me responds to a brief \u2014 say, a 1000-bed hospital, a residential complex or an educational institution \u2014 and creates something artistic and functional. Through this collaboration with Prshant and Rekha Lahoti, I wanted to see if we could design artworks that spark wider interest, not limited to map nerds.\u201d Between the folds Ankon wanted visitors to pause, observe the oritecture (origami and architecture) artworks and discover new details. \u201cI then thought of three-dimensional artworks that reveal a few details and conceal a few within the origami of origami, that pique the viewers\u2019 curiosity.\u201d Ankon Mitra, lampshade with printed map, globe with origami maps| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Having browsed the maps at Kalakriti Archives, the artist worked out a road map (pardon the pun) to make three-dimensional art inspired by the two-dimensional maps. \u201cI found maps of Europe dating back to the 12th and 13th centuries and maps of India from the 17th century to the present and shortlisted what could work for this show. Prshant has a series of city maps, pilgrimage maps, bazaar maps, and so on.\u201d Ankon explains how a map of Madurai shows the Meenakshi Sundareshwarar temple and its vicinity, with flower sellers and copper vessel sellers, thus mapping the bazaar. Another map of Benares shows the bazaars near the Kashi Vishwanath temple. A pilgrimage map of Uttarakhand highlights prominent religious sites including Kedarnath, Badrinath and Amarnath. A few maps of Indian pilgrimage sites are reimagined through the Japanese art of Ikebana. In his research, Ankon found parallels between the art and culture of India and Japan. \u201cThere is a spiritual significance to the method of Ikebana arrangements and the placement of the vase. We tried to reinterpret old pilgrimage maps in that form.\u201d Maps of Thiruchendur, Uttarakhand, Dwaraka and Benares are printed and folded in a specific manner to form the ikebana-inspired artworks. This is Ankon\u2019s first full-fledged showcase of artworks in Hyderabad, which also features pinwheel-inspired installations and ori-kiri (a combination of origami and kirigami) installations with printed maps. Old and new \u201cWe also created lenticular maps,\u201d says the artist. The idea borrows from the distortion of images when viewed through a double convex lens. Ankon reimagines the concept inspired by the childhood plastic toys that reveal two images when we turn a card left to right in our hands. The origami folds of the paper have been worked upon such that a lenticular map of Jaipur reveals a Unesco World Heritage-tagged map of the walled city (2019) when viewed from one side. From another direction, the same map shows an archival Navagraha map of Jaipur city (1885). The installation works as a sculptural time travel. A lenticular map installation by Ankon Mitra| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Map Unfolded features nearly 100 artworks, a few inspired by everyday objects. A pinwheel is reimagined as the earth spinning on an imaginary axis. Spin the artwork and maps of the north and the south poles come into view. Did anyone say maps are boring? An ori-kiri artwork, within its cuts and folds, reveals a map of the Himalayas, Tibet and Kashmir. Apart from maps sourced from Kalakriti Archives, a few abstract installations are inspired by \u2018cloud maps\u2019 made public by the European Space Agency (ESA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA (NASA), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and their geosynchronous satellites, with video footage from the International Space Agency (ISS). Selfie mirror room \u201cThe idea of including maps of clouds and galaxies was to complete the circle, apart from having maps of cities and countries,\u201d says Prshant. He views this exhibition, with its 3D sculptures, murals and installations, as varied expressions of form, space and light. Mirror room| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement A mirror room where visitors can take selfies, while archival maps and images of the Charminar and Red Fort come into view, further amplify the interactive quotient of the exhibition. Elsewhere, a globe is also reimagined as a series of origami sculptures. \u201cA display of archival maps and photographs is something museums have been doing for decades,\u201d says cartophile Prshant. \u201cI wanted to marry archival material with contemporary art to make it more interesting.\u201d Origami-inspired art with printed maps, he says, can be viewed as an extension of how older maps are folded and preserved. \u201cEach time I open an old map, I find it tough to fold it back the same way. There are overlaps, which also add to the artistic quality.\u201d Maps Unfolded might just be the beginning. Kalakriti and Ankon are working on a new collaborative showcase for India Art Fair 2025.

            "description": "French prosecutors are using a tough new law to target Telegram\u2019s Durov with no international equivalent that criminalises tech titans whose platforms allow illegal products or activities",
            "content": "When French prosecutors took aim at Telegram boss Pavel Durov , they had a trump card to wield - a tough new law with no international equivalent that criminalises tech titans whose platforms allow illegal products or activities. The so-called LOPMI law, enacted in January 2023, has placed France at the forefront of a group of nations taking a sterner stance on crime-ridden websites. But the law is so recent that prosecutors have yet to secure a conviction. With the law still untested in court, France's pioneering push to prosecute figures like Durov could backfire if its judges balk at penalising tech bosses for alleged criminality on their platforms. A French judge placed Durov under formal investigation last month, charging him with various crimes, including the 2023 offence: \"Complicity in the administration of an online platform to allow an illicit transaction, in an organised gang,\" which carries a maximum 10-year sentence and a 500,000 euro ($556,300) fine. Being under formal investigation does not imply guilt or necessarily lead to trial, but indicates judges think there's enough evidence to proceed with the probe. Investigations can last years before being sent to trial or dropped. Durov, out on bail, denies Telegram was an \"anarchic paradise.\" Telegram has said it \"abides by EU laws,\" and that it's \"absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform.\" In a radio interview last week, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau hailed the 2023 law as a powerful tool for battling organised crime groups who are increasingly operating online. The law appears to be unique. Eight lawyers and academics told Reuters they were unaware of any other country with a similar statute. \"There is no crime in U.S. law directly analogous to that and none that I'm aware of in the Western world,\" said Adam Hickey, a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general who established the Justice Department's (DOJ) national security cyber program. Hickey, now at U.S. law firm Mayer Brown, said U.S. prosecutors could charge a tech boss as a \"co-conspirator or an aider and abettor of the crimes committed by users\" but only if there was evidence the \"operator intends that its users engage in, and himself facilitates, criminal activities.\" He cited the 2015 conviction of Ross Ulbricht, whose Silk Road website hosted drug sales. U.S. prosecutors argued Ulbricht \"deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace ... outside the reach of law enforcement,\" according to the DOJ. Ulbricht got a life sentence. Timothy Howard, a former U.S. federal prosecutor who put Ulbricht behind bars, was \"sceptical\" Durov could be convicted in the United States without proof he knew about the crimes on Telegram, and actively facilitated them - especially given Telegram's vast, mainly law-abiding user base. \"Coming from my experience of the U.S. legal system,\" he said, the French law appears \"an aggressive theory.\" Michel Se\u0301jean, a French professor of cyber law, said the toughened legislation in France came after authorities grew exasperated with companies like Telegram. \"It's not a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"It's a weapon to prevent you from being impotent when faced with platforms that don't cooperate.\" Tougher laws The 2023 law traces its origins to a 2020 French interior ministry white paper, which called for major investment in technology to tackle growing cyber threats. It was followed by a similar law in November 2023, which included a measure for the real-time geolocation of people suspected of serious crimes by remotely activating their devices. A proposal to turn on their devices' cameras and mouthpieces so that investigators could watch or listen in was shot down by France's Constitutional Council. These new laws have given France some of the world's toughest tools for tackling cybercrime, with the proof being the arrest of Durov on French soil, said Sadry Porlon, a French lawyer specialized in communication technology law. Tom Holt, a cybercrime professor at Michigan State University, said LOPMI \"is a potentially powerful and effective tool if used properly,\" particularly in probes into child sexual abuse images, credit card trafficking and distributed denial of service attacks, which target businesses or governments. Armed with fresh legislative powers, the ambitious J3 cybercrime unit at the Paris prosecutor's office, which is overseeing the Durov probe, is now involved in some of France's most high-profile cases. In June, the J3 unit shut down Coco, an anonymized chat forum cited in over 23,000 legal proceedings since 2021 for crimes including prostitution, rape and homicide. Coco played a central role in a current trial that has shocked France. Dominique Pelicot, 71, is accused of recruiting dozens of men on Coco to rape his wife, whom he had knocked out with drugs. Pelicot on Tuesday testified in court, admitting to his guilt and asking his family for forgiveness. Meanwhile, 50 other men are also on trial for rape. Coco's owner, Isaac Steidel, is suspected of a similar crime as Durov: \"Provision of an online platform to allow an illicit transaction by an organised gang.\" Steidel's lawyer, Julien Zanatta, declined to comment.

            "description": "Former Indian Minister Smriti Irani highlights India\u2019s progress and financial potential often overlooked on the global stage",
            "content": "Observing that there is a lack of information about how much progress India has made, former Indian Minister Smriti Irani on Monday (September 16, 2024) said the financial prospects of the country have not been fully explored internationally. \u201cI don\u2019t think the financial prospects of our country are fully explored internationally. India as an economy is looked upon from the myopia of the lens, let\u2019s say that gets discussed at Davos or that gets discussed at the (World) bank, but operationally, we create opportunities in so many layers that are not visible,\u201d Ms. Irani said in response to a question during her appearance at the Observer Research Foundation America. Ms. Irani, who is currently on an unofficial trip to the U.S., said there is a lack of information about how much India has progressed. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much information about the climate action that has been undertaken by India. Similarly, let\u2019s say in precision manufacturing, in agro-based industry, the misconception is that our economy is open only for big business,\u201d she said. \u201cCurrently, if you look at the small traders in our country, 90% of retail trade is conducted in the so-called unorganised sector. From a business perspective, small shops, often referred to as \u2018kirana dukaan\u2019 in Delhi or \u2018mom-and-pop\u2019 stores in the U.S., are generating a turnover of $844 billion,\u201d according to the former Union Minister. Ms. Irani also highlighted India\u2019s achievement of administering 2.2 billion doses of vaccine in less than three months. \u201cThey were surprised because they never, when I say they, I\u2019m saying anybody outside of India, especially in the Western world, were shocked that we could get together an app and deliver not only doses, but 600,000 villages knew exactly what to do in a pandemic,\u201d the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said. She said other nations were also surprised that India could become a major force in PPE suit manufacturing in just three months, becoming the world\u2019s second-largest supplier, competing with China, and breaking financial barriers in the supply chain. \u201cWe also need to harness and keep harping about the fact that we in India have made a case for how supply chains globally will not be held hostage for political reasons. That is one message that India can time and again deliver to the world. Our stupendous success in how we handled COVID is a conversation that is not repeated often,\u201d Ms. Irani said. \u201cBut when our backs were to the wall, we not only made our vaccine, we not only protected to the best of our ability our citizens, but since then, we have also been giving food at the doorstep of 800 million Indians, which is not doable by any country in the world. So, I think that it is an imperative morally on us Indians, whenever we are outside our country, to keep talking about these issues, to say we got this much done,\u201d Ms. Irani said. She added that India is not waiting for the world to act but has created solutions for the world to benefit from. \u201cNeed to fully implement gender equity policies across Global South\u201d \u201cIndia is committed to prioritising gender parity,\u201d former Minister Smriti Irani has said, as she underlined the need to fully implement gender equity policies across the Global South to enhance global competitiveness. While addressing the World Bank leaders, Ms. Irani spoke about the issues of gender parity in the Global South and the importance of engaging both political and corporate leadership. \u201cOver the past decade, India has made remarkable strides in women-led development under PM @narendramodi\u2019s leadership. As the World Bank prepares to unveil its Gender Strategy 2024-2030, India remains committed to prioritising gender parity,\u201d she said in a post on X. \u201cIn order to expand our global competitiveness, leaders of government and commerce throughout the Global South must ensure that gender equity policies are fully implemented,\u201d a statement quoted Ms. Irani as saying. Education, healthcare, childcare, and housing policies disproportionately impact women\u2013 especially in developing and growing economies like India, she said. \u201cIt is critical that we get the policy right so that women and girls can help lead government and industry, while also fulfilling their personal potential,\u201d she added. \u201cOur region of the world is growing in terms of population, economic output, and global influence, so it is incumbent upon us \u2013 as leaders \u2013 to have the foresight, will, and commitment to ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to meet her or his potential,\u201d the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said. Ms. Irani will meet with government and business leaders in Washington over the next several days to discuss her priorities for gender equity, the statement said.

            "content": "Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud, who presided over the hearing, expressed his disapproval of the state's notification. The Supreme Court of India has strongly condemned the West Bengal government's directive preventing female doctors from working night shifts in state-run hospitals. This order was issued following the tragic rape and murder of a female doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9. The apex court, however, emphasized the need for enhanced security measures instead of restricting women from working night shifts. CJI: Women Require Security, Not Concessions Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud, who presided over the hearing, expressed his disapproval of the state's notification. Speaking to the West Bengal government's counsel, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, he questioned the rationale behind restricting women from working night shifts. \"How can you say women cannot work at night? Why limit women doctors? They don't want a concession; women are ready to work in the same shift,\" the CJI remarked. The Supreme Court highlighted that the issue could be resolved by providing adequate security for women, rather than curtailing their professional responsibilities. \"It is your responsibility to provide security; you cannot restrict women from working at night. Pilots, army personnel, and others work during nighttime hours,\" the CJI added. Supreme Court Orders Amendment of Notification The court directed the West Bengal government to revise its order, making it clear that women should not be restricted based on the time of their shifts. The bench reiterated that women in various professions, including those in aviation and the military, work during the night, and limiting women doctors based on time alone is unjustified. The court emphasized that security is paramount, and it is the state's duty to ensure a safe working environment for all employees, including female medical professionals. Call to Remove Victim's Name from Wikipedia During the hearing, the Supreme Court also addressed the issue of privacy, specifically ordering Wikipedia to remove the name of the victim from its platform. This directive aims to safeguard the dignity of the deceased and ensure privacy in sensitive cases like this one.",

            "content": "Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras have developed an indigenous portable Point-of-Care-Ultrasound (POCUS) Scanner for diagnosis of sports injuries. According to a press release, this device, from the institute\u2019s Centre of Excellence in Sports Science and Analytics (CESSA), could potentially allow for on-field diagnosis of injuries and an immediate assessment of the extent of injury that will allow for medical professionals to take a call on whether to permit the sportsperson to continue playing. The researchers have already been granted several patents for the technologies that went into this device and are working towards productisation. The Artificial Intelligence-powered scanner has a wide range of applications in sports medicine. It has the benefits of safety - no radiation - and sufficient resolution compared to other modalities. A working POCUS prototype for Musculoskeletal imaging developed at the Biomedical Ultrasound Imaging Lab is currently ready. The researchers are looking at completing the product prototype development by 2024. Testing and collection of pilot data from the field is also being planned in coordination with sports authorities. Arun K. Thittai, Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras, who led the team that developed this device, said that they observed a current technological gap and a need for a Point-of-Care device for injury management and rehabilitation of elite athletes within routine training premises. A quick assessment on the field would help sports players get immediate attention and focus on recovery. He added that the inputs from the POCUS assessment would be taken into the bigger AI platform for a holistic athlete management system. \u201cWe are currently exploring all options to take up POCUS for musculoskeletal imaging for commercial translation,\u201d Prof. Thittai, who is also a faculty member of CESSA, IIT Madras, said in the release.

            "content": "Four-and-half years after styrene gas leak at RR Venkatapuram, which resulted in 11 fatalities and affected thousands of residents living in the neighbourhood, LG Polymers India has come forward to pay ex-gratia to the families of the victims and also start a foundation to contribute to the future needs like health, education and employment. of the affected. Addressing the media at the collectorate here on Tuesday, head of corporate communications of LG Polymers Paul said that the company has decided to contribute \u20b9120 crore to relief efforts, in two phases. In first phase, \u20b960 crore will be disbursed immediately to the family members of the victims and in the second phase, another \u20b960 crore will be used to establish a foundation dedicated to long-term measures for the betterment of the affected people. \u201cWhile we cannot change the past, we believe that this commitment will help the families to rebuild their lives and help for their betterment,\u201d he said. Visakhapatnam MP M. Sribharat said that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had told the company\u2019s representatives, when they met him recently, to take steps to help the victims of gas leak. The Member of Parliament said that the victims were identified based on the association formed by the affected persons and also the report submitted by a government-constituted committee which investigated the gas leak. He also said that the officials of the district administration and the members of the LG Polymers gas leak affected victims association discussed the identification of the eligible persons. District Collector Harendhira Prasad said that as many as 6,121 persons from seven villages in the region will receive the ex-gratia/compensation within a week. The compensation will depend upon how severely the family was affected. The payment from the company would be in addition to the compensation of \u20b925 lakh to \u20b91 crore paid by the government after the gas leak. The relief is being provided without considering the outcome of the ongoing cases against the LG Polymers in the courts as well as the National Green Tribunal, he said. Visakhapatnam West MLA PGVR Naidu alias Gana Babu said that though compensation was paid by the government after the accident, most of the victims were not satisfied, as there was no clarity over future relief. He said that many victims are suffering from long-term health issues. He also alleged that the previous government gave many assurances, including construction of a super speciality hospital, but it has failed to lend a helping hand to the victims. The MLA also pinned hope that the relief measures by the management will ensure the victims get education, health, proper drinking water supply and other needs for the future. He also said that the government will strive to resolve the unemployment issue. Published - September 17, 2024 05:19 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "(India\u2019s first mpox case, and what it means for the country\u2019s public health landscape, a new senior citizen health cover scheme, Nipah care in Kerala, and more.) As usual, you might have guessed, the health sector in the country has been abuzz all week, all manner of infectious diseases, vaccines and policy level decisions that are likely to impact care and support have taken centre stage. But this week, we\u2019ll keep the focus on good news, as far as possible, and start with a key welfare aspect: The Union Cabinet approved health insurance cover for all aged 70 and above , Bindu Shajan Perappada n reported. This will benefit approximately 4.5 crore families, with six crore senior citizens, with \u20b95 lakh free health insurance cover on a family basis, under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. The best part of the scheme is that there are no exceptions, eligible candidates who are covered under private heath insurance policies or ESI scheme can also avail the benefits under this AB PM - JAY. If implemented as promised, the scheme will cover all citizens over 70 years, under medical care. Additionally, senior citizens aged 70 and above and belonging to families already covered under AB PM-JAY will get an additional top-up cover up to \u20b95 lakh per year for themselves (which they do not have to share with the other members of the family who are below the age of 70). All other senior citizens of 70 and above will get a cover up to \u20b95 lakh per year on a family basis. Senior citizens aged 70 and above who are already availing of the benefits of other public health insurance schemes such as the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), Ayushman Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) may either choose their existing scheme or opt for AB PM-JAY. Initially there would be a pilot launch to sort out any issues that might arise, a health ministry official said, adding that the Centre would roll out senior citizen health cover scheme within a week . \u201cIt is an application-based scheme. People will need to register on the portal. The facility of face authentication is available on the portal, which will have a designated link for senior citizens 70+ aged,\u201d he said. Naturally, the proof of any pudding is in the eating, so we will be keeping tabs on various processes up til and following the roll out of the AB PM-JAY, and further, it\u2019s implementation as well, including the uptake of the card in the empaneled hospitals. For an explainer on how to apply for the senior citizen component of AB PM-JAY peep into our explainers section. This past week has also been about unprecedented industry in the R&D section in medicine. A bunch of agreements were signed to advance medicare tech and vaccines, one instance of disciplinary action and many MoUs are on our list. N. Ravi Kumar reported that Bharat Biotech and Alopexx would collaborate for the anti-microbial vaccine AV0328 . A proprietary broad-spectrum anti-microbial vaccine candidate of Alopexx, AV0328 is a synthetic vaccine designed to target poly N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG) found on the surface of a wide range of bacterial, fungal and parasitic pathogens. Meanwhile, Indian Immunologicals, Indian Council of Medical Research ink pact for Zika vaccine . IIL has partnered with Griffith University, Australia, to develop the codon de-optimised live attenuated Zika vaccine, which has completed extensive pre-clinical evaluations and received permission from Indian regulatory authority to produce GMP grade materials for clinical developmental work. In addition to Zika, ICMR has inked agreements with industry, academic partners to advance first-in-human phase-1 clinical trials , for developing three other molecules. These are collaborative research over a small molecule for multiple myeloma with Aurigene Oncology Limited; coordinating a seasonal influenza virus vaccine trial with Mynvax Private Limited; and CAR-T cell therapy advancement study for a new indication of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with ImmunoACT. Indian Immunologicals was also in the news as it unveilled IVF media for bovine embryo transfer developed in partnership with NDDB. IIL launched an indigenous in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) media \u2018Shashthi\u2019, developed in collaboration with its parent \u2014 National Dairy Development Board. On August 24, the Government of India announced the \u2018BioE3\u2019 policy to drive innovation in the biotechnology sector by establishing biomanufacturing facilities, bio-AI hubs, and bio-foundries. anjeera Gowravaram,Viraj Mehta write about how Organ-on-chip tech could boost BioE3 goal to personalise medicine . A key focus area of the policy is precision therapeutics, which involve developing and administering drugs according to the needs of individual patients. The policy also aims to boost the development of biologics such as gene therapy and cell therapy. Since we are nearly done with the good news, here is a reality check. Last week, C. Maya and Zubeda Hamid reported that the Centre had suspended permission for manufacture and marketing of eye drops claiming to do away with reading glasses. A practical option for those with presbyopia or progressive loss of the near focusing ability of the eye due to ageing, was unveiled in August, a pilocarpine-based drops. However, thanks to the claims made by the company in the press release that followed the launch that the use of the eye drops would eliminate the need for glasses led to a backlash and eventually, for the clearance for Pres Vu eyedrops to be suspended. Do read the edit, here which argues that a possibly good measure has had to be suspended because of the exaggerated claims on the prowess of the product. C. Aravinda chimes in with a note of caution about using AI in health care . Essentially, he argues that delivering health care demands a human-centric approach of empathy and cultural understanding. Consciousness \u2014 the awareness and understanding of the real-world environment \u2014 underpins human decision-making, distinguishing human intelligence from AI. AI cannot replicate the moral and ethical reasoning that comes from conscious experience. Unlike other domains, health-care data is scattered, incomplete and often inaccessible for AI training, making it difficult to train a model. Training our guns on cancer, let\u2019s look at Joel P. Joseph \u2019s story first. If their ancestors help, weak cancer cells can form tough tumours , the author says. In a study, when cultured alone, drug-resistant cells grew more slowly than the cells from which they were \u2018descended\u2019. But when these cells and their ancestors were cultured together, the former grew much faster. Exciting frontiers up ahead, for sure. Some people believe that the holy grail of health care would be to understand cancer, and find a cure for it. But equally important would be to sort the infectious diseases paradigm, particularly being exacerbated by the excesses brought on by climate change. The Centre has set up a surveillance mechanism in the wake of \u2018undiagnosed fever\u2019 that claimed 15 lives in Gujarat\u2019s Kutch region. Samples of the infected patients have been sent to the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) in Gandhinagar and at the National Institute of Virology in Pune to identify the exact cause of the fever and the subsequent deaths. Malappuram in Kerala, remains a hot spot for the Nipah virus, after it\u2019s earlier encounter with Nipah. One death was confirmed there this past week . And, further, after Nipah, one suspected Mpox case surfaces in Malappuram . I write about the resurgence of cholera epidemics, globally, exacerbated by the effects of climate change: Panic in the time of cholera: addressing issues critical to managing a resurgence . V. Geetanath writes about concerns expressed by experts: a long COVID impact study is missing in country. To round up with some positive news, ICMR has confirmed that it would develop evidence-based guidelines for antibiotic use in respiratory infections, pneumonia. Do read Rajeev Jayadevan\u2019s article on Diabetes drug may lower death rate in obese people . Yes, he\u2019s talking about semaglutide, which is being bandied about as a \u201cwondrous weight-loss drug\u201d, but in a large scale study among diabetics. Following up on a hot subject from the past weeks, when the National Medical Commission was criticised robustly for its new MBBS guidelines which it had to drop, now experts say the NMC\u2019s re-revised CBME guidelines are no better, and demand another round of review and correction . Here\u2019s following up another key issue that continues to rock Kolkata\u2019s medical scene, the RG Kar rape and murder case. Chief Minister Mamata drops officials and urges doctors to come back Shrabana Chatterjee and Moyurie Som provide an update: Kolkata rape and murder case: Doctors continue protests, reject Bengal government call for talks Kolkata doctors set fresh conditions, continue stir Senior doctors in West Bengal warn of \u2018adverse steps\u2019 against government action on junior medics We accepted all demands, but CM refused to hold meeting, say protesting doctors Serena Josephine M . reports on the perception of the female health workforce in Tamil Nadu on how safe their workplaces are for them: Demanding a minimum guarantee: safety for women in health workforce in Tamil Nadu Our explainers for the week are: With Dhananjay Vaidyanathan Rohini and Gautam Dongre\u2019s article, you are all set to understand India\u2019s sickle cell challenge Anup Rawool and Vid Karmarkar provide a primer on Understanding ovarian cancer: its causes, symptoms, and screening methods Ayushman Bharat health insurance: How to apply for senior citizen\u2019s health cover?

            "content": "An ongoing food festival brings popular Hyderabadi kebabs, biryanis, and khubani ka meetha Published - September 17, 2024 05:14 pm IST Ajwain macchi tikka| Photo Credit: Siva Saravanan S Chef Bilal Khan fuels our conversation on Hyderabadi cuisine with the story of meat-loving toothless Nawabs. \u201cThe royal cooks had to come up with something that the nawab could eat without having to chew. They ground the meat into a fine paste and then added ginger and garlic, poppy seeds and various combinations of spices, made them as patties and roasted them over a fire. The resulting kebabs were crispy on the outside but so soft and silky within that even the toothless could eat them with pleasure,\u201d he explains, speaking about cuisines from Hyderabad which is a blend of Persian, Mughlai and Lucknowi at an on-going food festival at Latitude Restaurant of Vivanta Coimbatore. Born in Hyderabad, Bilal who is now with Taj Krishna there, is an expert on royal cuisine and comes with 33 years of experience (earlier at Taj Banjara) with a knowledge of authentic Hyderabadi food and relates to the regal kitchens of the erstwhile Hyderabadi Nawabs.

The result is a flavourful biriyani with tender meat that falls off the bones. Saratchandra Banerji, executive chef at Vivanta, Coimbatore with Chef Bilal Khan from Taj Krishna, Hyderabad| Photo Credit:Siva Saravanan S Chef Bilal Khan fuels our conversation on Hyderabadi cuisine with the story of meat-loving toothless Nawabs. \u201cThe royal cooks had to come up with something that the nawab could eat without having to chew. They ground the meat into a fine paste and then added ginger and garlic, poppy seeds and various combinations of spices, made them as patties and roasted them over a fire. The resulting kebabs were crispy on the outside but so soft and silky within that even the toothless could eat them with pleasure,\u201d he explains, speaking about cuisines from Hyderabad which is a blend of Persian, Mughlai and Lucknowi at an on-going food festival at Latitude Restaurant of Vivanta Coimbatore. Born in Hyderabad, Bilal who is now with Taj Krishna there, is an expert on royal cuisine and comes with 33 years of experience (earlier at Taj Banjara) with a knowledge of authentic Hyderabadi food and relates to the regal kitchens of the erstwhile Hyderabadi Nawabs.

Hung curd is another must. We wanted to offer an exciting royal fare for our diners,\u201d says Saratchandra Banerji, executive chef of Vivanta. Hyderabadi cuisine draws from the legacies of Deccani cuisine of Nizams with its delectable biryanis, haleem (pounded wheat and mutton dish) and kebabs.

And the best part is the indulgent sheer-e-khorma, a hot rich kheer made from super fine vermicelli, and double ka meetha, a juicy bread pudding garnished with finely chopped raisins, almonds and cashew nuts that can be savoured just the way the Nawabs relished it.

The Harmanpreet Singh-led Indian team edged past the hosts China in the final at the Moqi Training Base, Hulunbuir in China with a 1-0 win. With this, India have clinched a record-extending fifth Asian Champions Trophy title and their second consecutive crown in the tournament. India were denied for the first three quarters despite some big attacking moves by the defending champions. Chinese goalkeeper Wang made some brilliant saves from the field and on penalty corners. But the deadlock ended with a superbly planned goal from the Indians in the final quarter. Captain Harmanpreet Singh gave a brilliant ball to another defender Jugraj in front of the goal and Jugraj nailed his strike past the Chinese goal-saver. In the first three quarters, the Indians kept pressing to find an opening but the Chinese came in numbers in defence to deny any chances. The penalty corners were also saved. But the Indians stayed firm, knowing the reward would come if they kept playing with positive intent. Harmanpreet passed to Jugraj in the D came as a bit of a surprise as the Chinese might be keeping a tap on the attackers but the defender found the opening goal, which turned out to be the winner. China had reached the final of the tournament for the first time and they gave India a good run for the money. Their previous best finish was two fourth-placed finishes in 2012 and 2013. For India, this was their fifth title, having won it four times previously in 2011, 2016, 2018 (joint winners with Pakistan) and 2023. They are the most successful team in the tournament with Pakistan being the second-best side, having won three titles. Meanwhile, Pakistan settled with a third-place finish in this edition of the tournament as they defeated South Korea in the clash for the bronze medal. Pakistan registered a come-from-behind win to take the match 5-2 after trailing 0-1 at one point.",

            "content": "Mali's army said Tuesday (September 17, 2024) that the situation was \"under control\" after what it called a foiled infiltration attempt by \"terrorists\" into a military police base in the capital, Bamako, where attacks are rare. \"Early this morning, a group of terrorists tried to infiltrate the Faladie military police school,\" the army said on social media. \"The situation is under control,\" it also announced in a news flash on radio and television. The security ministry spoke of \"terrorist attacks\" against \"sensitive points of the capital\", including the military police school. Mali's military-led authorities generally use the term \"terrorists\" to describe jihadists and separatists in the north of the country. Search operations are under way, the army said, calling on people to remain calm and avoid the area. Two members of the military police were wounded, they and their family told AFP . Bamako is normally spared the kind of attacks that occur in some parts of the West African country on an almost daily basis. But the city awoke on Tuesday to the sound of gunfire and explosions, an AFP correspondent said. Sporadic shots were still ringing out at the start of the morning. \"This morning armed men attacked at least one military police base in Bamako. They have not been formally identified,\" a police source told AFP on condition of anonymity. Black smoke could be seen rising from an area near the airport. \"Bamako airport is temporarily closed due to events,\" an airport official said, without saying how long the closure would last. Gunfire, explosions Volleys of gunfire interspersed with explosions began at around 5:00 a.m. (local and GMT), the AFP correspondent said. A witness said he and other worshippers were stuck in a mosque near the area during early morning prayers. The French high school, Liberte, announced it would remain closed \"due to external events\". Staff at the United Nations mission in Mali received a message, saying: \"Gunshots heard in parts of Bamako. All UN personnel are to restrict movements until further notice.\" Poor and landlocked Mali has since 2012 been ravaged by different factions affiliated to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, as well as by self-declared defence forces and bandits. The violence spilled over into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger. Mali has been ruled by a military junta since back-to-back coups in 2020 and 2021. Under junta leader Colonel Assimi Goita, Mali broke a long-standing alliance with European partners and former colonial power France, turning instead to Russia and its Wagner mercenary group for support. The military government last year also ordered the withdrawal of the U.N. stabilisation mission, MINUSMA, and in January ended a 2015 peace agreement with separatist groups in the north. Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger - the latter two also now under military leadership - formed their own Sahel alliance a year ago and all pledged to leave regional bloc, ECOWAS. The worsening security situation in Mali has been compounded by a humanitarian, economic and political crisis. The military leaders have pledged to regain control of the entire country.

            "description": "The bill would provide a legal basis for authorities to outlaw Pride events and public displays of the LGBT rainbow flag, and to impose censorship of films and books.",
            "content": "Georgian lawmakers on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) approved the third and final reading of a law on \"family values and the protection of minors\" that would impose sweeping curbs on LGBT rights. The bill would provide a legal basis for authorities to outlaw Pride events and public displays of the LGBT rainbow flag, and to impose censorship of films and books. Leaders of the governing Georgian Dream party say it is needed to safeguard traditional moral standards in Georgia, whose deeply conservative Orthodox Church is highly influential. Activists say the measure is aimed at boosting conservative support for the government ahead of a parliamentary election on Oct. 26 in Georgia, a country that has ambitions to join the European Union but which Western governments fear is now tilting back towards Russia. Tamara Jakeli, director of campaign group Tbilisi Pride, said the bill, which also restates an existing ban on same-sex marriage and bans gender reassignment surgery, would likely force her organisation to close its doors. \"This law is the most terrible thing to happen to the LGBT community in Georgia,\" Jakeli, 28, told Reuters. \"We will most likely have to shut down. There is no way for us to continue functioning.\" Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, a critic of Georgian Dream whose powers are mostly ceremonial, has indicated that she will block the bill. But Georgian Dream and its allies have enough seats in parliament to override her veto. LGBT rights are a fraught topic in Georgia, where polls show broad disapproval of same-sex relationships, and the constitution bans same-sex marriage. Participants in Tbilisi\u2019s annual Pride marches have come under physical attack by anti-LGBT protesters in recent years. Foreign agents The issue has become more prominent ahead of October\u2019s election, where Georgian Dream is seeking a fourth term in office and is campaigning heavily against LGBT rights. The ruling party, whose top candidate for the election is billionaire ex-prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, has deepened ties with neighbouring Russia as relations with Western countries have soured. Earlier this year, it passed a law on \"foreign agents\" that the European and U.S. critics said is authoritarian and Russian-inspired. Its passage sparked some of the largest protests Georgia has seen since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Opinion polls show the party, which in 2014 passed a law banning anti-LGBT discrimination before later pivoting to more conservative positions, remains Georgia\u2019s most popular, though it has lost ground since 2020, when it won a narrow majority in parliament. In one ruling party advert aired on Georgian television, Pride director Jakeli\u2019s face is shown alongside the words: \"No to moral degradation\". Jakeli said that the bill could only be stopped if Georgian Dream were to lose power in October, though she noted that the country\u2019s opposition parties are not overtly supportive of LGBT rights. \"The only way we can survive in this country and have any progress on LGBT rights is for us to go in great numbers to the elections and vote for change,\" she said.

            "content": "Sri Lanka will be up against New Zealand in a two-match Test series with a short turnaround after what eventually turned out to be a joyous series, especially after the win at the Oval. Sri Lanka got their batting and bowling plans spot on to bowl out England cheaply in the third innings while later chasing it down quite comfortably. The last time the two teams met in a Test series, New Zealand ended up winning both the games last year. However, that was at home and performing and winning away from home is quite critical for New Zealand, who despite winning the inaugural World Test Championship, haven't won a single overseas assignment since 2019. They have the team this time around, given the Black Caps have come well prepared with five spin bowling options but they'll have to get into their work quickly as they play five Tests, two against Sri Lanka and then three against India and losing more than two Tests might take the WTC final qualification out of their hand. The first Test of the two-match series in Galle begins at 10 AM IST on Wednesday, September 18 with the start at the same time for all six days and not five (September 21 being a rest day) till September 23. The SL vs NZ Test series will be live telecast on the Sony Sports 5 channel while the live streaming will be available on the SonyLiv app and website. Fancode will also stream the matches.

            "content": "Union Minister for Coal and Mines G. Kishan Reddy, also the Telangana BJP president saw a \u2018conspiracy to cover up\u2019 the historical facts in the State Government not celebrating the Telangana Liberation Day leading to the present generations being unaware of the protracted struggle against the erstwhile Nizam before Independence was gained for the region. People voluntarily participated in the armed struggle Addressing a press conference at the Parade Grounds on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) after he hoisted the national flag to celebrate the Telangana Liberation Day under the aegis of the Ministry of Culture, the BJP leader stated that people had voluntarily participated in the armed struggle against the Nizam with whatever they could marshal including kitchen implements and it has no parallel even in world\u2019s history. The \u2018atrocities\u2019 of the Nizam and his armed militia of Razakars led by Qasim Rizvi had began from 1940 itself against the majority community reaching the peak between 1946-48. These included indiscriminate imprisonments, high taxes, raids, restrictions on Telugu language and culture usage, rapes, torture, forced conversions, etc. He gave an account of some of the key incidents during the period. Hence, it is \u2018cruel\u2019 to hide such history when there was so much struggle from the masses, sacrifices by scores of people and many lives lost, he said. The Centre is determined to host the celebrations officially whether the local governments do it or not and a gazette notification was also issued to this effect, he reiterated. Union Minister of State for Defence Bandi Sanjay Kumar, Rajya Sabha MP K. Laxman and others were present. Kow-towing to Majlis Party Earlier, addressing the gathering at the Parade Grounds, Mr. Kishan Reddy has accused the current Congress Government as well as the Opposition Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) party of kow-towing to the \u2018communal and dynastic\u2019 Majlis Party and refusing to celebrate the Telangana Liberation Day. Majlis Party is a \u2018successor\u2019 to the erstwhile Razakars responsible for the atrocities on the women and common folk during the Telangana freedom struggle. However, these two parties (Congress and BRS) have been bowing before the party and cheating people, he maintained and implored people to fights against those practising the \u2018politics of bankruptcy\u2019. Conveying his best wishes to the people on the occasion, Mr. Kishan Reddy pointed out that while the entire country became independent from the British rule on August 15, 1947, the people of Telangana had to wait for a harrowing period till September 17, 1948 to get themselves freed from the \u2018tyrannical\u2019 rule of the Nizam. But, the liberation came at a great cost as thousands of lives lost, before the then Home Minister Sardar Patel ordered \u2018O\u0301peration Polo\u2019 where the Indian Army had decisively inflicted a crushing defeat on the Nizam\u2019s forces leading to a surrender. Mr. Kishan Reddy noted that the day has become even more special as it coincided with the conclusion of the nine-day festivities of the Ganesh Chaturthi where the idols are immersed in the water bodies, \u2018Vishwakarma Jayanthi\u2019 and Mr. Modi\u2019s birthday. Cultural programmes and a march past by central para-military forces were also part of the celebrations. The BJP leader hoisted the national flag at the State office, has paid his respects to the martyrs at the War Memorial and also garlanded the statue of Sardar Patel.

            "content": "Even as Kalyana Karnataka Utsav celebrations were underway on September 17, 2024, to mark the anniversary of the region\u2019s liberation from the rule of Hyderabad Nizam, the BJP in Kalaburagi district resorted to protests demanding the government to allow the Siddhasiri Ethanol and Power Unit at Chincholi to resume operations. The plant in question, which was forced to down its shutters for non-compliance and violation of environmental norms, and terms and conditions set by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, is owned by BJP\u2019s firebrand leader and MLA for Vijayapura Basangouda Patil Yatnal. After Chief Minister Siddaramaiah hoisted the national flag and delivered his address at the District Armed Reserve (DAR) police ground in Kalaburagi, BJP leaders, including MLA for Chincholi Avinash Jadhav, MLA for Kalaburagi Rural Basavaraj Mattimadu, MLC Shashil Namoshi, leaders Amarnath Patil, Shivaraj Patil Raddewadagi and Chandu Patil, staged a demonstration along with a few activists and farmers at Public Garden in the city. They demanded that the government allow the plant to resume cane crushing. BJP activists protesting in Kalaburagi on Kalyana Karnataka Utsav Day demanding the government to allow BJP leader Basangouda Patil Yatnal-owned Siddhasiri Ethanol and Power Unit to resume its operations at Chincholi in Kalaburagi district, on September 17, 2024.| Photo Credit:ARUN KULKARNI Some BJP leaders said that the agitation was planned on Kalyana Karnataka Utsav Day to bring the attention of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to the issue. In Chincholi, BJP activists and farmers attempted to take out a procession and stage demonstrations with the same demand. However, police detained them in the taluk administrative complex and arranged a discussion on the issue with the Pollution Control Board and Revenue Department officials. Officers of the Pollution Control Board Shivaraj, Rakesh and Sudharani tried to convince BJP leaders Vijayakumar Cheganti, K.M. Bari, Sreemanth Kattimani and Chitrashekhar Patil and farmers\u2019 leaders Nandkumar Patil, Janardhan Kulkarni, Suryakanth Huli and others about the reasons for issuing the closure notice to the plant. Unconvinced agitators tried to walkout from the meeting. However, the police did not allow them to leave the complex. Protestors detained BJP leaders later alleged that the agitating activists and leaders were detained inside the taluk administrative complex in the name of discussion just to avoid the agitation. In Sedam, a group of farmers led by BJP leader and former Sedam MLA Rajkumar Patil Telkur was stopped by the police at Malkhed when it was moving towards Kalaburagi to submit a memorandum to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. It is learnt that the farmers wanted to raise several \u2019 issues before the CM. They protested on the spot as they were not allowed to meet him. Police also stopped the farmers at Mahagaon Cross, Ashok Nagar, Edga Cross, Kodli Cross, Kamalapur, Kalagi and other places to prevent them from reaching Kalaburagi where Chief Minister Siddaramaiah participated in the Kalyana Karnataka Utsav. \u201cWe wanted to meet Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and raise many problems that the region\u2019s farmers are facing. However, the police did not allow us. The district administration used force to prevent us from meeting the CM,\u201d a farmer said.

Despite trailing against the Koreans 0-1, the Green Shirts came back roaring to win the match 5-2 and take the third prize home. Pakistan had earlier stunned by the hosts China in the first semifinal on penalties but put aside the disappointment of not playing for the title with a brilliant win in the third-place playoff. Korean skipper Lee Jungjun opened the scoresheet with a strike early in the second quarter. Pakistan had their chances in the quarter with a few penalty corners but they could not score. The deadlock for the Green Shirts broke into the third quarter when Sufyan Khan converted a penalty corner into a goal to bring it 1-1. Hannan Shahid got the former champions into the lead in the very next minute but the Koreans equalised soon. The top goal-scorer of the tournament Yang Ji-hun brought South Korea back on level in the same quarter to leave the match open. In the last moments of the third quarter, Rooman brought Pakistan into the lead again 3-2 after a cross from Ahmad Nadeem. The Koreans trailed for the first time and needed some inspiration to get the better of the Green Shirts in the final quarter. But Pakistan upped their game in the final quarter, scoring two more goals to kill the match. Sufyan Khan",

Kejriwal cited personal reasons for his departure but did not elaborate on the specifics. The announcement comes as a surprise to many, as Kejriwal has been a central figure in Delhi politics since his first election win in 2013.",
            "content": "Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal resigned as Delhi Chief Minister on Tuesday, handing over the reins to his colleague Atishi. This move followed Kejriwal\u2019s release on bail in the liquor policy case. He submitted his resignation to Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, alongside Atishi and ex-Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who is also out on bail in the same case. Atishi, the newly appointed Chief Minister, expressed her commitment to working for the people of Delhi and securing victory in the upcoming election. Speaking to reporters, she referred to Kejriwal as her \"mentor\" and assured that her primary goal would be his return to power. \"Delhi has only one Chief Minister, and that is Kejriwal,\" she declared, while also accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of conspiring against Kejriwal with \"fake charges.\" Earlier, the AAP announced Atishi\u2019s unanimous selection as the leader of its legislative party, positioning her to lead the party until the next Assembly election in February. Kejriwal, however, has called for an early election, possibly as soon as next month. Following his release from jail, Kejriwal made a dramatic statement, asserting that while he received justice from the legal system, he now seeks justice from the people of Delhi. \"I want to ask the people of Delhi, is Kejriwal innocent or guilty? If I have worked, vote for me,\" he declared. Atishi\u2019s succession comes amidst ongoing tensions with the BJP, as Kejriwal continues to deny the corruption charges against him. The former CM was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in March and later by the Central Bureau of Investigation in June, both linked to the liquor policy scam.",

            "content": "The two-match series between India and Bangladesh will kick off on September 19 in Chennai at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Sarfaraz Khan has expressed his excitement about the prospect of sharing the Indian team\u2019s dressing room with the legendary Virat Kohli during the upcoming two-match Test series against Bangladesh, which begins on Thursday, September 19, at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. While Sarfaraz has previously shared a dressing room with Kohli during his stint with the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), he is particularly thrilled about the opportunity to do so with the Indian national team. Kohli was not part of Sarfaraz's debut international series earlier this year against England due to personal reasons. However, both players have been selected for the squad for the first Test against Bangladesh. \"His passion and spirit are unmatched. Whenever I saw him, even in the pre-match meetings, he'd take charge and tell everyone how many runs he'd score off a particular bowler and break that down for everyone. To be gutsy enough to stand up and talk with such positivity in front of everyone and then deliver the next day is a very unique ability,\" Sarfaraz told JioCinema. ('Different Style But No...': Rohit Sharma On Gautam Gambhir-Led Coaching Staff Compared To Rahul Dravid) \"I met him at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium for the first time. I had scored 45 runs in 21 balls here and he bowed to me. I had a lot of fun that day. It was a dream to share an Indian team dressing room with him it will come true in the future if I get the opportunity,\" he added. Sarfaraz made his international debut for India during the home Test series against England this year which Virat missed due to birth of his second child. In three matches, Sarfaraz has scored 200 runs at an average of 50.00, with three fifties in five innings and best score of 68*. The two-match series between India and Bangladesh will kick off on September 19 in Chennai at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. The second long-format game will begin on September 27 in Kanpur. In his first Test assignment, head coach Gautam Gambhir will be keen on securing a series win. For Rohit Sharma's side, this series against Bangladesh will be followed by New Zealand's tour of India for three Tests starting from October 16, and then the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia from November 22. India's squad for the 1st Test against Bangladesh: Rohit Sharma (C), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Sarfaraz Khan, Rishabh Pant (WK), Dhruv Jurel (WK), R Ashwin, R Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Jasprit Bumrah, Yash Dayal.",

            "description": "This analysis has been billed as the first research to track the global impact of superbugs over time, and to estimate what could happen next",
            "content": "Infections of drug-resistant superbugs are projected to kill nearly 40 million people over the next 25 years, a global analysis predicted on Monday, September 16, 2024, with the researchers urging action to avoid this grim scenario. Superbugs -- strains of bacteria or pathogens that have become resistant to antibiotics, making them much harder to treat -- have been recognised as a rising threat to global health. The analysis has been billed as the first research to track the global impact of superbugs over time, and to estimate what could happen next. More than a million people died from the superbugs -- also called antimicrobial resistance (AMR) -- per year across the world between 1990 and 2021, according to the GRAM study in The Lancet journal . Deaths among children under five from superbugs actually fell by more than 50 percent over the last three decades, the study said, due to improving measures to prevent and control infections for infants. However, when children now catch superbugs, the infections are much harder to treat. And deaths of over-70s have surged by more than 80 percent over the same period, as an ageing population became more vulnerable to infection. Deaths from infections of MRSA, a type of staph bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics, doubled to 130,000 in 2021 from three decades earlier, the study said. The researchers looked at 22 pathogens, 84 combinations of drugs and pathogens, and 11 infectious syndromes such as meningitis. The study involved data from 520 million individual records across 204 countries and territories. The researchers used modelling to estimate that, based on current trends, the number of direct deaths from AMR would rise by 67 percent to reach nearly two million a year by 2050. It would also play a role in a further 8.2 million annual deaths, a jump of nearly 75 percent, according to the modelling. Threat to modern medicine Under this scenario, AMR will have directly killed 39 million people over the next quarter century and contributed to a total of 169 million deaths, it added. But less dire scenarios are also possible. If the world works to improve care for severe infections and access to antimicrobial drugs, it could save the lives of 92 million people by 2050, the modelling suggested. \"These findings highlight that AMR has been a significant global health threat for decades and that this threat is growing,\" said study co-author Mohsen Naghavi of the US-based Institute of Health Metrics. Jeremy Knox, infectious disease policy head at the UK-based health charity the Wellcome Trust, warned that the effects of rising AMR rates would be felt across the world. \"An increasing AMR burden at the scale described in the GRAM report would represent a steady undermining of modern medicine as we know it, as the antibiotics we rely upon to keep common medical interventions safe and routine could lose their effectiveness,\" Knox told AFP . While there has been a steady increase in political attention on the subject over the last decade, \"we have yet to see governments around the world go far enough, fast enough in tackling the threat of AMR\", he added. He described a high-level AMR meeting at the United Nations scheduled for September 26 as a \"vital moment\" for the fight against superbugs. Antimicrobial resistance is a natural phenomenon but the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and plants has made the problem worse.

            "description": "Disappointment with southern leadership over long-pending demands, and a divided Tamil polity have led them to consider different options",
            "content": "Sri Lanka\u2019s northern Tamil voters are torn this presidential election, between a candidate who may win, and one who will certainly lose. While some are backing one of the frontrunners among the Sinhalese candidates, others have decided to support a Tamil candidate. Every voter knows well that \u201cTamil common candidate\u201d P. Ariyanethiran \u2014 fielded jointly by some political and civil society groups based in the island nation\u2019s north and east \u2014 cannot win, given the numeric reality of Sri Lanka\u2019s electoral map. The Sinhalese majority make up around 75 % of the country that was torn apart by bitter ethnic conflict between the two communities. All the same, many Tamil voters see him personifying their grievances. GROUND ZERO: A poverty of hope among Sri Lankan Tamils \u201cAfter the civil war ended in 2009, our people hoped that even if their political rights were denied, they could live with some security and dignity. Listening to our [Tamil] political leadership, they backed different candidates in past elections. What did we gain?\u201d asks Fr. Santhiyogu Marcus, President of the Mannar Citizens Committee, an influential civil society group in the coastal district. Also read: The slippery slope to the Kurunthurmalai hilltop For at least two decades Tamils had a straightforward choice and delivered a bloc vote \u2014 except when the rebel Tamil Tigers enforced a boycott in 2005 \u2014 in the presidential elections. They despised the Rajapaksa clan, accused of serious human rights violations during and after the civil war. They emphatically rejected Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2010 and 2015, and Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019. The main Tamil party representing Tamils of the north and east, too, invariably backed the chief challenger of the Rajapaksas in every national election. Altered landscape However, this is the first election campaign in 20 years that is not dominated by a Rajapaksa surname. Two years after a people\u2019s uprising evicted Mr. Gotabaya from office in 2022, when the island faced a crushing economic crisis, Sri Lanka\u2019s political terrain looks starkly different. The September 21 election, the first poll since, has three candidates at the fore \u2013 incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe, opposition politicians Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, one of whom is expected to win. \u201cAriyanethiran is not seen as an individual who will win this contest, but as someone who is a symbol of our identity and struggles,\u201d Fr. Marcus observes. Many acknowledge his bleak electoral prospects but say they will back him nevertheless, to deliver a \u201cstrong message\u201d to the southern political establishment and the international community. On the other hand, critics of the move term it \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d. Abandoning pragmatic negotiation with the southern leadership would further isolate Tamils and weaken their bargaining power, they contend. Fifteen years after the civil war ended, after claiming several tens of thousands of civilian lives, Tamils in the north and east are unable to live in peace. Their lands are systematically grabbed by state agencies, their call for truth and justice over alleged war crimes remain, the whereabouts of scores of forcibly missing persons are unknown, a just political solution is elusive, and the war-battered economy has not created decent jobs or livelihoods. Also read: In Sri Lanka\u2019s north, a search for livelihoods and loved ones In this context, sections see backing the Tamil candidate as a way of airing their frustration \u2013 not just with the national leadership, but also with their own, deeply divided Tamil political leadership. \u201cTamil leaders are showing us that they cannot be united in this struggle. The parties have split and there are so many splinter groups. They have weakened our position so much,\u201d says K. Rajachandran, leader of a Jaffna-based fisheries cooperative. \u201cSo, we want to tell our Tamil politicians, even if you can\u2019t stand united, the Tamil people will come together behind this common candidate.\u201d Fragmented Tamil polity The northern Tamil polity is in shreds, with prominent leaders taking poll positions ranging from backing a southern candidate; campaigning for the Tamil \u201ccommon candidate\u201d; to boycotting the polls altogether. The once-powerful Tamil National Alliance (TNA), led by the prominent Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), has collapsed, with two other constituents breaking away some years ago. Even the ITAK is marred by serious internal divisions, seen in the conflicting positions aired by its members on a daily basis in the run up to the polls. The contradictions within were no secret earlier but have become more pronounced after the passing of senior Tamil leader R. Sampanthan in June. Earlier this month, the ITAK, through its Jaffna legislator M.A. Sumanthiran, announced its support for presidential aspirant Mr. Premadasa , a popular choice among Tamils who have decided to back a southern leader. Explaining its decision on Monday, the party said although none of the three leading candidates\u2019 manifestos fully accommodated Tamils\u2019 basic political demands, Mr. Premadasa\u2019s assurance was \u201cin relative terms, somewhat satisfactory\u201d. In his manifesto, Mr. Premadasa has promised to fully implement the 13 th Amendment, which devolves some power to the provinces, and swiftly hold elections to the now-defunct provincial councils. Meanwhile, ITAK legislator Sivagnanam Shritharan is canvassing for Mr. Ariyanethiran, and senior leader Mavai Senathirajah continues to give mixed signals. \u201cVoters are finding it very confusing this election,\u201d notes Rajany Rajeshwary, founder of Vallamai, a Jaffna-based movement for social change. While she appreciates why some people are drawn to the Tamil candidate, her concern is that if he does poorly, it will defeat its political motive. \u201cI fear that our votes will be split, and we will expose our weakness,\u201d she says. Tamils, she argues, must also factor in concerns of Tamil-speaking Muslims [they identify as a separate ethnic group] and fellow Tamils of the hill country to forge a strong, consolidated political position. Meanwhile some voters, especially youth, are disillusioned. They voice little hope about their future, regardless of a \u201ctactical vote\u201d for a Sinhalese contestant or a \u201cprincipled vote\u201d for a Tamil candidate this election. \u201cSome of us have no plans or resources to go abroad,\u201d says Marynathan Edison, a fisherman and environmentalist in Mannar. \u201cWe will live in this country until we die. In the south, they tell us \u2018think and vote as a Sri Lankan\u2019. How can I do that when their discriminatory actions keep reminding me that I am Tamil?\u201d he asks.

            "content": "The Supreme Court's intervention was prompted by a case from Gujarat, where municipal authorities threatened to demolish a family's home after a member of the household was named in an FIR. The Supreme Court of India has temporarily halted bulldozer demolitions across the country until October 1, unless they involve public roads, water bodies, or railway lines. The court's decision reflects concerns over the widespread use of demolition as a punitive measure without proper legal oversight. The ruling was issued on Tuesday, and the court announced it would develop formal guidelines to regulate when and how properties can be demolished under municipal laws. Criticism of Bulldozer Justice Last week, a Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Hrishikesh Roy, Sudhanshu Dhulia, and SVN Bhatti expressed strong disapproval of the increasing use of bulldozers in demolitions, particularly in cases where properties are destroyed without due legal process. The bench criticized what it referred to as \"bulldozer justice,\" calling it a practice that is \"inconceivable\" in a nation governed by the rule of law. The justices emphasized that any state action, including demolitions, must be in accordance with the law and not used arbitrarily. Case in Gujarat Sparks Concern The Supreme Court's intervention was prompted by a case from Gujarat, where municipal authorities threatened to demolish a family's home after a member of the household was named in an FIR. The family, which has lived on the land in Kathlal, Kheda district for over two decades, sought the court's protection against what they viewed as an unfair and retaliatory action. The petitioner\u2019s lawyer argued that the house in question was legally constructed, and the involvement of one family member in an alleged crime should not justify the demolition of their residence. The Supreme Court concurred, stating, \"In a country where actions of the State are governed by the rule of law, the transgression by a family member cannot invite action against other members of the family or their legally constructed residence.\" Akhilesh Yadav's Reaction On Supreme Court's direction, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said, \"Bulldozer can't be justice. It was unconstitutional, it was to scare people. Bulldozer was to deliberately suppress the voice of Opposition. I thank Supreme Court for this direction that has stopped bulldozer. CM, UP government and the people of BJP glorified the 'bulldozer' as if this is justice...Now, when the Supreme Court has given a direction, I think the bulldozer will stop and justice will come through court.\"",

            "content": "Jammu and Kashmir is gearing up for its first assembly elections in a decade, with the first phase of polling set for Wednesday (September 18). Over 23 lakh voters will decide the fate of 219 candidates, including 90 independents, who are running for 24 Assembly segments\u2014 eight in three districts of Jammu region and 16 in four districts of Kashmir valley. The first round will see 24 assembly constituencies contested across the Chenab Valley districts of Doda, Kishtwar, and Ramban, as well as the South Kashmir districts of Anantnag, Pulwama, Kulgam, and Shopian. The second phase, covering 26 seats, is slated for September 25, while the third and final phase, involving 40 seats, is scheduled for October 5. Here is the schedule in detail: If the infographic isn\u2019t visible or is incomplete, click here to exit AMP mode Dissolution and delimitation Since the dissolution of the Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly, despite contrasting claims , on November 21, 2018, by the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Satya Pal Malik, the then-state has gone through much change; mainly the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India on August 5, 2019, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. With this, and the passing of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, the State was split up into the union territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir from October 31, 2019. On May 5, 2022, the Jammu and Kashmir Delimitation Commission notified the new boundaries, names, and the number of Assembly constituencies. Compared to the previous delimitation, which comprised 87 seats (including the 4 seats in the Ladakh region), the new Assembly in the Union Territory has 90 seats: 47 in Kashmir and 43 in Jammu. This is an increase from the earlier 83 (in the regions of Jammu and Kashmir), with six additional seats being in Jammu and one in Kashmir. These 90 seats will be contested across three phases, as shown in the graphic below. 2014 elections: A recap In the 2014 elections, which were held across five phases in the unified Jammu and Kashmir, the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed-led Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (JKPDP) won 28 seats, which was the most won by any party, but still short of the majority of 44 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 25 seats, followed by the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) which won 15 seats, and the Congress won 12. The breakup of the seats won in the 2014 election, and the elections in 2008, 2002, and 1996 are shown in the graphic below. When the four major parties (stated above) active in the State are considered across the divisions of Kashmir, Jammu, and Ladakh; the JKPDP established a stronghold in Kashmir by winning 25 of the 46 seats in the valley. Meanwhile, the BJP won 25 of 37 seats in the Jammu region, and Congress won three of four seats in the Ladakh division. The constituency-wise results are presented in the graphic below. When it comes to the margin of victory, out of the 87 seats, a total of 50 seats were tightly contested with the margins of victory of the winning candidates being lesser than 10% of the vote share. The graphic below shows the constituencies that fall within different brackets of the margins. The voter turnout was relatively low in the valley, and higher in the Jammu division, as seen in the graphic below. The total voter turnout averaged to 65.23% over the five phases in the Assembly elections. Seat shares since 1996 Since 1996, it can be seen from the chart below, the strength of JKNC has gone downhill in the State from winning 57 seats in 1996, to 15 in 2014. Meanwhile, the BJP has seen a noticeable rise in power since 2002, especially in the Jammu division. This year, while the Congress has tied up with NC , BJP is set to contest the polls solo. While BJP has not officially allied with any party, it has backed several \u2018independents\u2019 or local parties aligning with the party\u2019s policy on J&K\u2014 i.e., accepting revocation of J&K\u2019s special status. Apart from these four main players, there are three other noteworthy parties in the poll fray \u2013 Sajjad Lone\u2019s J&K People\u2019s Conference (PC), ex-Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad\u2019s Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP), and Altaf Bukhari\u2019s J&K Apni Party.

            "content": "HYDERABAD Working president of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) K.T. Rama Rao has suggested Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy to fulfil all his pre-poll promises made to people, if he is capable enough, instead of making meaningless comments, using filthy language against political opponents and focusing on pleasing Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Speaking after unfurling the national flag and cleansing the \u2018Telangana Thalli\u2019 statue on the premises of BRS headquarters in Hyderabad on Tuesday he said they had been celebrating September 17 as the National Integration Day as it was on the same day in 1948 the princely State of Hyderabad was integrated with the Indian Union. However, some parties were misleading people on the importance of the day. Instead of biding time on targeting the opposition parties and please the Congress party\u2019s high command, the Congress Government could as well focus on enhanced Rythu Bharosa of \u20b915,000 per acre as only 14 days time was left for the completion of Kharif season, \u20b92,500 per month assistance to women, \u20b94,000 per month social security pension including to the parents of government employees and filling two lakh vacancies by December this year, as promised. He reasoned that Mr. Reddy had got the Rajiv Gandhi statue installed in a hurry to appease Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as he had termed them as \u2018bali devatha\u2019 and \u2018mudda pappu\u2019 (goddess seeking sacrifice and a dumb) in the past when Mr. Reddy was with Telugu Desam Party. By installing the Rajiv Gandhi status in the place earmarked for Telangana Thalli status, he not only insulted Telangana but also hurt the self-respect of the people. The BRS leader reiterated that they would shift the Rajiv Gandhi statue to Gandhi Bhavan and install a Telangana Thalli statue in front of the Secretariat building as soon as they come back to power. He demanded that the government clear bills for completed works in gram panchayats before elections as sarpanches and panchayat secretaries were worried about the money they spent on works by borrowing it. Party leaders C. Malla Reddy, S. Madhusudana Chary, Palla Rajeshwara Reddy, K. Venkatesh Yadav, G. Jagadish Reddy, Maloth Kavitha, Dr. Methuku Anand, Dasoju Sravan and others participated in the national integration day and cleansing of Telangana Thalli statue as part of the party\u2019s protest call against the installation of Rajiv Gandhi statue.

National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah, during his campaign in Budgam, where he is contesting elections, said that the restoration of Article 370 is not impossible as it was not a decision made by God. He noted that the Supreme Court, which gave the verdict against the article, could tomorrow rule in their favor. \u201cThe court has ruled in our favor three times before, and it can do so again. Nothing is impossible,\u201d he stated. Omar further explained, \"Three previous decisions made by the Supreme Court were changed by a five-judge bench, and in the future, a seven-judge bench could also reverse the decision.\" He was responding to Home Minister Amit Shah, who recently said that Article 370 is now history and will never be part of India's Constitution again. Targeting Shah, Abdullah added that the Home Minister should focus on the current situation and the rise of terrorism in Jammu, saying, \"The Centre has been directly ruling Jammu & Kashmir for the last ten years. So, who is responsible for the situation in Jammu now?\" Earlier, Farooq Abdullah stated, \"We will fight for the restoration of Article 370 and will again approach the Supreme Court.\" He added that the National Conference remains committed and will continue its fight for the restoration of Article 370.",

            "content": "In Gambhir\u2019s first outing as coach, India swept the T20I series against Sri Lanka 3-0, but lost the ensuing ODI series 0-2. Team India skipper Rohit Sharma on Tuesday (17 September) said new head coach Gautam Gambhir's style is different from his predecessor Rahul Dravid but insisted he shares a good rapport with the former KKR coach, and the rest of his fresh set of support staff. Gambhir, who's a World Cup-winner, took charge of India in July during a white ball tour to Sri Lanka. It now time for his first Test series assignment as coach of the Indian cricket team against Bangladesh. The first Test will begin on Thursday (September 19). In Gambhir\u2019s first outing as coach, India swept the T20I series against the Islanders 3-0, but lost the ensuing ODI series 0-2. \"Obviously, Rahul bhai, Vikram Rathour (former batting coach) and Paras Mhambrey (former bowling coach) were a different team and it is only acceptable that the new support staff will bring different perspective,\" Rohit said in the pre-series press conference here on Tuesday. \"But the matches that we engaged in (with the new staff) in Sri Lanka, they seemed to be sensible and understanding. They began to learn things pretty quickly within the team,\" he added. Dravid's tenure ended after India's T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies and he will next be seen heading the coaching staff of IPL side Rajasthan Royals. Rathour and Mhambrey were replaced by Abhishek Nayar (assistant coach) and South African Morne Morkel (bowling coach), while former Dutch all-rounder Ryan ten Doeschate also joined as an assistant coach. While Nayar joining the team was largely a given, Morkel and Doeschate, who worked with Gambhir at the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, beat former pacers R Vinayakumar and L Balaji in the race to spots among the India support staff. Rohit used his long association with Gambhir during the latter's playing days, and with Abhishek Nayar in the Mumbai dressing room to underline his comfortable working relation with them. \"It's a new (support) staff for sure, but I have known Gautam Gambhir and Abhishek Nayar long enough. Every support staff has its operating style, and that's what we were expecting. (India vs Bangladesh: IND vs BAN Test Match Preview, Head To Head Stats, Full Squads, Records- Check Details Here) \"I have worked with different coaches over 17 years of my career, and it's vital to understand that all of them have a unique perspective (about cricket), and it's a must that you adjust with them,\" said Rohit. While Rohit has never worked alongside Morkel and Doeschate, the 37-year-old said he has enough knowledge of them from their days as cricketers to strike a comfortable equation. \"I have also played matches against Morne Morkel and Ryan ten Doeschate. I have some close encounters with Morkel, but not so much with Ryan, may be a couple of matches. But that doesn't matter. \"As of now, there have been no issues or problems as such (with the new set of support staff). We have a great understanding of each other. \"Good understanding is important, and I have that with them,\" he added on his dynamics with the new head coach and his team. (ICC Announces Record Breaking Prize Money For Women's T20 World Cup 2024) In his first media interaction after taking charge in July, the 42-year-old Gambhir had also rejected apprehensions about his equation with the team's senior players by citing his familiarity with them during his playing days.

            "content": "Ravichandran Ashwin revealed coach Ravi Shastri's reaction after India's infamous 36-all out in the 2020 Adelaide Test. IND vs AUS: Indian spin veteran Ravichandran Ashwin revealed the atmosphere in the dressing room following their dreadful 36-all out in the first Test against Australia at Adelaide back in 2020. In one of the dark chapters of their cricketing history, Team India was skittled for their lowest over in Tests during the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2020-21 at Adelaide. This came after they enjoyed a 53 run lead over the hosts in the first innings. This set Australia a target of 90 runs, which they chased down easily to take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series. Ashwin revealed in a video on Vimal Kumar's official Youtube Channel, that though the team members were feeling down and not even thinking of a series win, the then head coach Ravi Shastri lifted the mood by organising a team dinner and arranging for a karaoke, singing some Hindi songs himself. \"We were not thinking about a series win because we were just bowled out for 36. The mood in the dressing room was a bit own. Ravi Bhai organised a team dinner. He arranged for karaoke, he started singing. He sang old Hindi songs. Everybody joined in,\" said Ashwin. Ashwin recalled that after the first Test, Virat was preparing to leave in order to be with his wife and Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma for the birth of their first child. The team kept \"small targets\" following a humiliating defeat by eight wickets in the first Test. \"We were in a bubble, Virat was also getting ready to return. We were just focussing on doing well in the next Test in Melbourne. We kept small targets,\" said Ashwin. What happened after such a big defeat for India was nothing short of a movie plot. Rather than getting bogged down, the team played some inspirational, positive cricket in next three Tests under the leadership of Ajinkya Rahane, who led in Virat's absence. India secured a memorable 2-1 series win after handing Australia their first loss at the Gabba in around 32 years in the final Test. The team overcame every challenge hurled at them. The Border-Gavaskar series between India and Australia will begin on November 22, with the first Test at Perth. The second Test, scheduled for December 6 to 10 at Adelaide Oval, will feature the exciting day-night format under the stadium's lights. After that, fans will turn their attention to The Gabba in Brisbane for the third Test, which will be held from December 14 to 18.The customary Boxing Day Test, set for December 26 to 30 at Melbourne's storied Melbourne Cricket Ground, will bring the series to its penultimate stage. The fifth and final Test, taking place at the Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3 to 7, will serve as the series climax, promising a dramatic conclusion to an exciting contest.",

            "description": "Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped up the party\u2019s election campaign in the State in which he was seen dispelling fears of the Dalit community surrounding the reservation.",
            "content": "As the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) continues to make extensive efforts to retain its decade-long power in Haryana , the party\u2019s outreach to Dalits has been growing in an apparent bid to woo the crucial vote bank. The Scheduled Castes (Dalits) account for over 20% of the State\u2019s population, according to the 2011 Census, and with the BJP losing its electoral sheen in the reserved assembly segments of the State over the years, the path to gain their support and vote would certainly be not an easy task for the party. Notably, the BJP, which came to power in 2014 in Haryana had then won nine of the 17 Assembly seats reserved for SCs, however, the number of seats for the BJP dropped to five in the 2019 Assembly polls, while the Congress though went up from four seats in 2014 to seven seats in 2019. In the recent Lok Sabha polls, the Congress improved its vote share in the SC-reserved seats. A post-poll analysis by CSDS-Lok Niti pointed out that a majority of all Dalits in Haryana shifted from BJP-led National Democratic Alliance to Indian National Development Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped up the party\u2019s election campaign in the State in which he was seen dispelling fears of the Dalit community surrounding the reservation. At a rally in Kurukshetra, Mr. Modi while assuring the Dalits about \u201cno intention of the BJP to end the reservation,\u201d he blamed the Congress party of being the biggest opponent of Dalits, saying \u201cThe Congress has always opposed reservation... but Congress should listen carefully as long as Modi is here, I will not allow even an iota of the reservation given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar to be looted or taken away... this is Modi\u2019s guarantee.\u201d He added that the Congress was anti-Other Backward Classes and tribals as well . Soon after the Prime Minister\u2019s rally, the BJP leaders in their election campaign could be consistently seen focusing on the Dalit plank by raising their issues prominently in public rallies and events across the State. However, political observers have reservations about their success. According to Ronki Ram, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Chair Professor of Political Science at Panjab University, during the 2024 Lok Sabha election the narrative that the BJP could end the reservation worked against them. \u201cThe Lok Sabha elections were held only a few months ago, and the narrative that the BJP could end reservation during the poll campaign had gone deeply into the minds of SCs, which is difficult to undo at this stage. The BJP is making a desperate attempt but it would be difficult to regain the lost trust,\u201d he said. BJP focussing on Jats too The BJP had been at the receiving end of farmers\u2019 anger since the year-long farmers\u2019 protest surrounding the now-repealed central government\u2019s farm laws. The party faced farmers\u2019 wrath during the poll campaign of the recent Lok Sabha election, which is still palpable in the ongoing campaign of the State assembly polls in the rural areas of the State. \u2018Jat\u2019, the dominant agrarian class constitutes about 22% of the State\u2019s population. The BJP appears to be focusing its electoral politics surrounding the \u2018Jats\u2019 and \u2018non-Jats\u2019. Earlier this year, by replacing Manohar Lal with Nayab Singh Saini , who is an Other Backward Class (OBC) leader, as Chief Minister, the BJP seemed firming up its electoral hold among the OBCs, which accounts for around 35% of the State\u2019s population, according to ballpark statistics. However, garnering the support of the Dalit community remains a crucial factor for the incumbent government to make a comeback.

Elangovan has said power sharing in the government after the 2026 Assembly election is not possible as the first duty of the parties in the DMK alliance is to give a big electoral defeat to the religious fanatics. Addressing media persons after garlanding the statue of \u2018Periyar\u2019 E.V. Ramasamy on his 146 th birth anniversary here on Tuesday (September 17, 2024), the MLA said when political parties who are yet to reveal their policies talk about capturing power, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) founder Thol. Thirumavalavan has been in politics for many years and has significant vote share in the State. \u201cThere is nothing wrong in what he said as it is common for parties to think of having power in their hands,\u201d he said and added that power sharing after the Assembly election is not possible. Agreeing with the call for closing down Tasmac shops in the State, Mr. Elangovan said opening of toddy shops will not affect people\u2019s health and it will be of great help to the palm farmers. The MLA said he believed in total prohibition and pointed out that all his remarks on prohibition and toddy shops are his personal opinion. Taking a dig at the BJP over sharing the video of Coimbatore-based restaurateur apologising to the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , the MLA said, the owner raised issues related to different rates of Goods and Services Tax (GST) for sweets and other products. \u201cBut, he was threatened and forced to seek an apology and the BJP releasing the video in social media is disgusting,\u201d he added. The MLA said the Union Minister does not have the human nature to respect humans and claimed that political leaders and businessmen are marching against the BJP. Responding to Union Minister L. Murugan\u2019s claim that Chief Minister M.K. Stalin\u2019s US visit was a failure, Mr. Elangovan said Mr. Stalin met businessmen without taking a break everyday and succeeded in bringing Ford Motor Company back to the State . \u201cHis trip was successful and saying that he went to the US because of ill-health is out of jealousy,\u201d he said.

            "description": "West Bengal has experienced a continuous decline in its relative economic performance over several decades, according to a working paper by Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister(EAC-PM).Authored by EAC-PM member Sanjeev Sanyal, the paper 'Relative Economic Performance of Indian States: 1960-61 to 2023-24' said the development of eastern part of the country remains a concern.It said maritime states have clearly outperformed other states, with the exception of West Bengal.Although Bihar's relative position has stabilized in the last two decades, it remains significantly behind other states and requires much faster growth to catch up, the paper noted.Conversely, Odisha, traditionally a laggard, has shown a marked improvement in recent years.\"West Bengal, which held the third-largest share of national GDP at 10.5 per cent in 1960-61, now accounts for only 5.6 per cent in 2023-24. It has seen a consistent decline throughout this period.\"West Bengal's per capita income",

            "content": "The social media giant has been shrinking the influence of the Russian state-controlled media across its platforms since 2022. New York: Social media giant Meta announced that it has banned Russian state media broadcaster RT and other Kremlin-controlled networks over the alleged \"foreign interference activity.\" Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has alleged that the outlets were involved in deceptive influence operations and tried to avoid detection. Announcing the move in a statement on Monday, a Meta spokesperson stated, \"After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets. Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity.\" The ban will be implemented in the upcoming days across Meta's platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. The social media giant has been shrinking the influence of the Russian state-controlled media across its platforms since 2022. Before the ban, RT had 7.2 million Facebook followers and 1 million Instagram followers. This action is in response to recent allegations by the US that Russian media, especially RT, has been participating in covert activities to influence worldwide viewers. Earlier this month, two RT workers were charged by US authorities with money laundering. They are accused of planning to engage an American company to create material with the intention of impacting the 2024 US presidential election. On Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on several countries to treat the Russian state broadcaster RT in the same manner as \"covert intelligence operations.\" The coordinator for the State Department's Global Engagement Center, James Rubin, restated these worries, labelling RT as a channel where \"propaganda, disinformation, and lies are spread to millions, if not billions, of people around the globe.\" RT has derided the actions of the US, accusing it of trying to impede the broadcaster from operating as a journalistic organisation. Meanwhile, Russia has not yet commented on the ban.",

            "content": "While Maharashtra clocked broadly steady performance throughout the 1960-61 to 2023-24 period, West Bengal\u2019s share has been in continuous decline while Tamil Nadu, after a mid-way decline, picked up post-1991, according to the EAC-PM paper. New Delhi: Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu -- home to India's three largest industrial clusters in the 1960s -- have seen their fortunes subsequently diverge when it comes to their share of the national economy since 1960-61, with Mamata Banerjee-led state facing the steepest decline -- especially after she became the Chief Minister in 2011, a new paper by the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) to the Prime Minister showed on Tuesday. While Maharashtra clocked broadly steady performance throughout the 1960-61 to 2023-24 period, West Bengal\u2019s share has been in continuous decline while Tamil Nadu, after a mid-way decline, picked up post-1991, according to the EAC-PM paper which looked at the relative performance of states in terms of their share of the national economy and their per capita GDP as per cent of the national average. West Bengal, which held the third-largest share of national GDP at 10.5 per cent in 1960-61, now accounts for only 5.6 per cent share in 2023-24. The state had a 6.7 per cent share in the nation\u2019s economy in 2010-11 when Mamata Banerjee assumed CM\u2019s office. \"It (West Bengal) has seen a consistent decline throughout this period. West Bengal\u2019s per capita income was above the national average in 1960-61 at 127.5 per cent, but its growth failed to keep pace with national trends. As a result, its relative per capita income declined to 83.7 per cent in 2023-24, falling below that of even traditionally laggard states like Rajasthan and Odisha,\" the paper revealed. Maharashtra\u2019s economic performance has remained relatively steady throughout the period, despite a slight decline in its share over the last decade.",

            "content": "India\u2019s goods exports dropped 9.32% to $34.71 billion in August, while the import bill expanded 3.3% to $64.36 billion. The trade deficit widened to a ten-month high of $29.65 billion, reckoned to be the second highest monthly gap in goods trade. \u201cGold imports more than doubled from $4.9 billion a year ago to $10.06 billion this August. Trade deficit should not be a matter of concern for a developing economy and you should not compare the deficits of developed countries with fast growing countries like India,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal. \u201cTo the extent there are no foreign exchange issues, it should not matter,\u201d he asserted. On the spike in gold imports, Trade Ministry officials said \u201cGold prices have declined globally and there has also been an import duty cut. Moreover, this is the time of the year that jewellers start stocking up for the festive and wedding season.\u201d \u201cThe decline in value of petroleum products with oil prices dropping six dollars was a key factor for lower petroleum exports while gems and jewellery exports have been impacted by the sanctions imposed due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict that has made it difficult to procure rough diamonds,\u201d the Commerce Secretary said. \u201cHowever, the performance of our non gems and jewellery and non petroleum exports gives us comfort that despite the clouds of uncertainty hovering globally, India is still a bright spot,\u201d he noted. \u201cWhile the decline in petroleum prices is good for the oil import bill, which stood at $11.01 billion in August, it hurts the value of petroleum exports,\u201d he said.

He has been appointed as Additional Director General, Special Task Force. Mr. Verma, an officer of the 1998 batch, was the ADG and IGP (Law & Order) in his last assignment. After an extensive discussion between Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and protesting junior doctors on Monday (September 16, 2024), the West Bengal government decided to remove Commissioner of Kolkata Police, Health Department officials, and Deputy Commissioner (DC) North from their positions . Starting from September 2, 2024, junior doctors in Kolkata have been demanding the resignation of Mr. Goyal and have raised allegations of \u201cevidence tampering\u201d and suppression of the rape and murder of the RG Kar doctor whose death triggered the protest across Bengal in demand of justice. The victim\u2019s parents and family members also alleged that the police had offered them money even as the body of their daughter was lying at home. \u201cThe police offered us money when the body of our daughter was lying at home. Is this the humanity of the police,\u201d the aunt of the victim told reporters earlier. The deceased\u2019s father said the Divisional Commissioner of Kolkata Police, North, had entered their house and offered money. \u201cI told him that my daughter worked harder to become a doctor than he had to become an IPS officer,\u201d the father had said.

Australia got $1 million for winning the tournament in 2023 but this time the prize money of the champions has increased by 134 per cent which is a a staggering $2.34 million. The runners-up will also benefit from a 134 per cent rise, securing $1.17 million in the upcoming edition. The semi-finalists will receive $675,000 each, more than three times their 2023 payout. The prize money extends beyond the knockout stages, as each group stage win will now be rewarded with $31,154, reflecting a 78 per cent increase from last year's $17,500. Furthermore, teams that exit during the group stage won't leave empty-handed. There is a base prize of $112,500 awarded to all 10 participating teams, totalling $1.125 million. This ensures that every team receives substantial support for their participation, no matter where they finish. (Virat Kohli Leads Team To Victory In Fielding Competition Ahead Of IND vs BAN 1st Test, Video Goes Viral - Watch) Teams finishing fifth to eighth will earn $270,000 each, and teams finishing ninth and 10th earn $135,000 each.

            "content": "Processions for the immersion of Lord Ganesh idols began in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) morning amid tight security and fanfare as the 10-day festival drew to a close. The \u2018Ganesh Chaturthi\u2019 festival, which began on September 7, concludes with \u2018Anant Chaturdashi\u2019 on Tuesday (September 17, 2024). In Mumbai\u2019s Lalbaug area, famous for celebrating the festival with grandeur, the procession of the idol of Tejukaya mandal started amid the chants of \u201cGanapati bappa morya, pudhchya varshi lavkar ya\u201d (come soon next year Lord). Crowds gathered on the lanes of Lalbaug, braving the scorching sun to bid farewell to the famous Lalbaugcha Raja idol, which attracts the maximum number of devotees, celebrities and prominent personalities. Processions from various parts of Mumbai, including Fort, Mazgaon, Byculla, Dadar, and Chembur, will make their way towards the Arabian Sea and other water bodies for the final immersion, marking the end of this year\u2019s festivities. Devotees thronged the streets, especially on the main road leading to the Girgaon beach, in large numbers, eager to catch a final glimpse of the elaborately adorned idols of the elephant-headed god when they are taken out of pandals for their journey to immersion sites. There was also a large gathering of people at Lalbaug\u2019s Shroff building to witness \u2018pushpa vrushti\u2019 (showering of flowers) on the Ganesh idols. The Lalbaugcha Raja Ganapati idol hit the main road around 12.45 p.m. and headed towards Bharatmata junction, from where it will return to the Shroff building junction for \u2018pushpa vrushti\u2019. The processions of Rangari Badak Chawl Ganpati, Kalachowki Mahaganpati and Bal Ganesh Mandal\u2019s Ballaleshwar also reached the main roads. \u201cMore than 24,000 police personnel have been deployed in Mumbai to thwart any untoward incident during processions,\u201d officials said. Thousands of households and \u2018sarvajanik\u2019 (public) Ganesh idols will be immersed at 204 artificial ponds across the city, along with 69 natural water bodies like Girgaon, Dadar, Juhu, Marve and Aksa beaches. According to officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 675 Ganapati and Gauri idols, including six Sarvajanik Ganpatis, were immersed in the water bodies. Of these, 235 idols were immersed in artificial ponds, they said, adding that no untoward incidents were reported. The BMC said it has deployed more than 12,000 officials and staffers and set up 71 control rooms to manage the processions. It has posted 761 lifeguards and deployed 48 speed boats at the city beaches as a safety measure, and citizens have been advised to avoid entering the deep sea. It has also cautioned citizens about marine species such as \u2018blue button jellyfish\u2019 and \u2018stingrays\u2019 along Mumbai\u2019s coastline and advised immediate first aid in case of fish stings. According to the Mumbai police, drone surveillance will be in place at important immersion sites such as Girgaon Chowpatty, Dadar, Bandra, Juhu, Versova, Powai Lake, and Madh Island, along with a network of more than 8,000 CCTVs. Besides the local police deployment, State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) platoons, quick response teams (QRT), riots control police (RCP), delta, combat, home guards, and Maharashtra Security Force have also been roped in, the officials said. More than 2,500 traffic police personnel will ensure the smooth movement of vehicles across the city during immersion processions. Entry to some roads will be restricted, and some routes will be made one-ways, while some will have diversions, they said. For efficient coordination, 192 control rooms have been established across various administrative divisions, and 66 observation towers have been erected to monitor key areas. To promote eco-friendly celebrations, the BMC has introduced a QR code system providing information on nearby artificial ponds. Citizens can scan the code or visit https://portal.mcgm.gov.in for directions to these ponds via Google Maps.

            "content": "NCPI has said that with this new feature, the UPI LITE balance will automatically be reloaded by an amount chosen by the user, not exceeding the UPI LITE Balance limit, whenever the balance falls below a maximum limit set by them. New Delhi: National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a circular on auto top-up feature on UPI lite, that will allow the balance to be automatically reloaded whenever it falls below a minimum limit set by the user. UPI LITE enhances the user experience by allowing PIN less transactions under Rs 500 with a maximum UPI LITE balance limit of Rs 2000 at any point of time. NCPI has said that with this new feature, the UPI LITE balance will automatically be reloaded by an amount chosen by the user, not exceeding the UPI LITE Balance limit, whenever the balance falls below a maximum limit set by them. This increases the convenience and adaptability of UPI LITE by automating the process of reloading funds. Additionally users shall be provided with the option of revoking the auto top-up mandate at any point of time by the PSP/App. Since the balance resides with the users' bank and the UPI LITE can be deleted anytime with instant refund of UPI LITE balance to users' main bank account, the requirement of pre-debit notification which is a usual mechanism for merchant mandate payments, has been dispensed with. NCPI has asked banks and PSP/App to ensure the following guidelines 1. Issuer banks live on UPI LITE shall support the functionality of auto top-up on UPI LITE wherein the banks should allow creation of UPI LITE mandate and allow debits whenever the request comes from PSP/App. 2. UPI Apps shall support the necessary functionality and interface on their App for the customer to use auto top-up on UPI LITE 3. Members shall ensure that the mandate created successfully are executed successfully 4. PSP/Apps shall put necessary controls to limit the number of auto-replenishment transactions to 5 per day per LITE account 5. Issuer bank shall ensure the necessary communication to teh customer of all the mandate related operations In addition to this bank shall also be required to follow the necessary guidelines released by NCPI on auto top-up UPI LITE from time to time. Members who are live on UPI LITE are requested to hereby note the changes and enable the feature by 31 October 2024.",

            "content": "Learn 4 effective strategies to lead through uncertainty. Discover how to embrace the unknown, communicate transparently, encourage curiosity, and overcome perfectionism to thrive in challenging times. In today's rapidly changing world, uncertainty has become the norm. With increasing complexity, fierce competition, and evolving market conditions, leaders face the daunting challenge of making decisions in an ambiguous environment. Despite the lack of a clear roadmap, leaders must continue to guide their teams and organizations forward. Research shows that what sets high-performing leaders apart isn't their ability to make flawless decisions but rather their ability to make decisions quickly and confidently, even in the face of limited information. Navigating through uncertainty requires a blend of foresight, resilience, and trust. Here are four key strategies that can help leaders not only survive but thrive amid the turbulence. 1. Embrace the Unknown with Confidence One of the most important traits of an effective leader is the ability to embrace uncertainty with confidence. In an unpredictable environment, maintaining complete control is an illusion. Great leaders acknowledge this and view uncertainty as an opportunity for growth and innovation, rather than a threat. By reframing uncertainty as a chance to explore new possibilities, leaders can foster a culture of resilience. This positive mindset helps create an environment where team members feel empowered to experiment, take calculated risks, and even experience occasional failure without fear. When leaders present a calm and confident demeanour, it instils a sense of optimism within their teams, encouraging them to navigate the unknown together. This mindset shift is crucial for creating a culture where innovation and progress can thrive. 2. Communicate with Transparency and Authenticity Effective communication is vital during times of uncertainty. Leaders must prioritize transparency, providing regular updates and sharing information as it becomes available. In periods of change, over-communication is better than under-communication. In addition to frequent updates, leaders need to articulate a clear vision that aligns with the aspirations of the team. This \"change story\" should address the concerns of team members and customers alike, helping to foster trust and reduce anxiety. Open and honest communication also involves acknowledging the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead. By listening to employees' concerns and addressing potential risks, leaders build credibility and create a culture of openness. When leaders communicate authentically, they provide a sense of stability in uncertain times, allowing their teams to stay focused and engaged in their work. 3. Encourage Curiosity and Healthy Debate During times of uncertainty, innovation is crucial. Encouraging curiosity and fostering healthy debate among team members can help leaders and organizations uncover creative solutions to their challenges. Leaders must create an environment where employees feel comfortable challenging assumptions and exploring new ideas. By promoting diverse perspectives and open dialogue, teams can discover innovative approaches to problem-solving. Healthy debates allow for psychological safety, where employees feel confident expressing their views and are given equal opportunities to contribute. Research shows that fostering a culture of curiosity and open discussion is key to effective problem-solving and creative thinking. Leaders who encourage this approach will see their teams thrive in uncertain times, developing solutions that can propel the organization forward. 4. Overcome Perfectionism In the face of uncertainty, the pursuit of perfection can be paralyzing. While striving for excellence is important, perfectionism often leads to unnecessary delays, missed opportunities, and a fear of taking risks. Leaders must recognize the difference between perfectionism and healthy striving. Healthy striving involves setting realistic expectations and knowing when to say, \"that's good enough\" and move forward. As one CEO famously put it, \u201cPursuit of perfection does not produce great results; it just stops people from taking action or risks.\" Leaders who embrace uncertainty understand that progress is often more important than perfection. By promoting a culture of experimentation, they encourage their teams to take action, learn from mistakes, and adapt quickly to changing circumstances. This mindset helps organizations remain agile and better equipped to handle the unpredictability of the future. Leading through uncertainty is no easy task, but by embracing the unknown, communicating transparently, fostering curiosity, and overcoming perfectionism, leaders can navigate the challenges of today\u2019s unpredictable environment. These strategies help build resilience, drive innovation, and ensure that teams can move forward with confidence, even when the path ahead is unclear. By accepting uncertainty as a dynamic force, leaders can manage it more effectively and guide their organizations toward future growth and success.",

            "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) lashed out at the Congress for creating a controversy around his participation in a Ganesh Utsav alongside Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud . Speaking at the launch of the \u2018Subhadra\u2019 scheme , Mr. Modi highlighted the significance of September 17, marking the historic annexation of Hyderabad into India and this year\u2019s Ganesh Visarjan. \u201cAt a time when we are bidding farewell to Lord Ganesh, you have seen Congress and its ecosystem expressing anger over the past few days because I attended a Ganesh Puja (without mentioning the event with CJI). In Karnataka, under the Congress government, they committed an even greater offense \u2014 they placed an idol of Lord Ganesh behind bars. The entire country is disturbed by these images,\u201d the PM remarked. \u201cThe hate-filled thinking and mindset to infuse poison in society will prove dangerous for our country. We should not let these hatred groups move ahead. We have to achieve many goals by staying together,\u201d he said. Also read | Indira Jaising, MP Sanjay Raut question CJI Chandrachud\u2019s independence after Ganpati Puja celebration with PM Modi Narrating how Ganesh Utsav played role in India\u2019s freedom struggle, Mr. Modi said, \u201cGanesh Utsav is more than just a festival of faith. It played a key role in India\u2019s freedom struggle. At a time when the British were sowing divisions based on caste and using the \u2018divide and rule\u2019 strategy to maintain power, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak awakened the spirit of the nation by transforming Ganesh Utsav into a public celebration.\u201d \u201cThe religion teaches us to stay united by rising above caste divides. Ganesh Utsav had become symbol of such effort,\u201d he observed. Today, Ganesh Utsav brings people together, fostering unity and participation across all sections of society. There is no discrimination. The festival creates a sense of collective strength and harmony. Just as the British once viewed it with suspicion, today\u2019s power-hungry individuals and groups who seek to divide society also resent the festival,\u201d Mr. Modi said taking pot shot at Congress. On Hyderabad Mukti Diwas \u2013annexation of Hyderabad with India, the PM said, \u201cwhen foreign forces sought to destabilize India after its independence, and opportunists attempted to divide the nation for their own power, Sardar Patel stepped up with remarkable resolve, uniting the country. September 17 is not just a date. It serves as a reminder of our duty to uphold the unity of our nation.\u201d Published - September 17, 2024 03:50 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Prime Minister Narendra Modi / Orissa / politics",

            "content": "India's overall exports, combining merchandise and services, fell by 2.4% in August, reaching USD 65.4 billion compared to USD 67 billion in the same month last year, according to Commerce Ministry data released on Tuesday. Merchandise exports dropped to USD 34.71 billion from USD 38.28 billion, while services exports rose to USD 30.69 billion from USD 28.71 billion. For the first five months of 2024-25 (April-August), total exports stood at USD 328.86 billion, reflecting a 5.35% year-on-year increase. Despite the recent dip, the government remains optimistic about achieving its full-year export target of USD 800 billion. India's overall imports in August rose by 3.45%, reaching USD 80.06 billion, up from USD 77.39 billion the previous year. This led to a widening of the trade deficit, which increased from USD 10.39 billion to USD 14.66 billion in August. India recorded USD 778 billion in exports in the financial year 2023-24, with services exports rising to USD 341.1 billion and merchandise exports slightly declining to USD 437.1 billion. Despite this, overall imports fell from USD 898 billion in 2022-23 to USD 853.8 billion, significantly reducing the trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion to USD 75.6 billion. The government\u2019s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and exports, has contributed to making Indian manufacturers globally competitive and reducing the country's import dependence. The initiative is showing signs of success in sectors like electronics and other key industries.",

            "content": "A day after his release from Tihar Jail, Arvind Kejriwal announced that he would resign from the post of the Delhi chief minister. Earlier in the day, he announced that senior AAP leader Atishi will be Delhi\u2019s new chief minister after the party unanimously agreed on Tuesday. Kejriwal will meet Lt Governor VK Saxena at Raj Niwas at 4.30 pm to tender his resignation as chief minister, paving the way for Atishi's appointment as his successor. After Kejriwal's resignation, a delegation of AAP legislators will meet the lieutenant governor to stake claim for the formation of a new government led by Atishi, party leader Gopal Rai told reporters. Amid these developments, take a look at all the chief ministers who resigned mid-term in the last few years. Just ahead of a Supreme Court-mandated floor test, resigned as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh as the government fell short of numbers in the Assembly. During that time he told reporters that he had decided to step down from the post. However, he will continue working for the people despite his post. After Kamal Nath's resignation, BJP leader returned as the chief minister of the state. Just 9 days before completing four years as head of a BJP government in Uttarakhand, Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned as chief minister in March 2021, saying the time had come to pass on the baton. Giving reasions for his resignation, Rawat said a collective decision was made and he decided to step down. In less than four months later, Tirath Singh Rawat, who had replaced Trivendra Singh Rawat as the Uttarakhand chief minister also resigned from the post of chief minister. And soon after submitting his resignation, Tirath said after considering the constitutional crisis, he found it appropriate to resign. Senior BJP leader BS Yediyurappa also resigned as the Karnataka chief minister after months of speculations in Karnataka\u2019s political circles. Soon after resignation, Yediyurappa said there has been no coercion from anyone in Delhi and he voluntarily decided to resign on the occasion of the second anniversary of the government. Veteran BJP leader Vijay Rupani also resigned from the post of Gujarat chief minister in September 2021, becoming the fourth chief minister to do so in the year. Notably, he resigned as the Gujarat chief minister, saying this is an \u201copportunity\u201d for the party\u2019s new leadership to take over. Just before Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate over an alleged land scan, he submitted his resignation as the head of government in the state. The incident marked the end of days of drama between Soren and the investigative agency \u2013 from the ED searching his Delhi residence to his party lashing out over his image being \u201cmaligned\u201d. Arvind Kejriwal followed suit and is all set to resign as Delhi chief minister on September 17 at 4:30 PM. Before his resignation, he chose Atishi as the next Delhi chief minister.",

            "description": "Meghalaya minister says those who advocate beef ban are extremists; Nagaland refuses permission for the Gau Dhwaj Sthapana Bharat Yatra; AAPSU and its Mizroram counterpart too object the rally",
            "content": "A rally by a cow protection group has earned the wrath of several northeastern parties, including the Nagaland unit of the BJP. Meghalaya Education Minister Rakkam A. Sangma on Monday expressed concern over the Gau Dhwat Sthapana Bharat Yatra by the representatives of Shankaracharya Avimukteshwaranand to hold the rally on October 2 seeking the declaration of the cow as the \u2018mother of the nation\u2019 and a cow slaughter-free India. The minster is a leader of the National People\u2019s Party, an ally of the BJP. \u201cI request the organisers of such rallies not to enact this drama. They can hold the rally elsewhere in the country,\u201d Mr. Sangma said, asserting \u201cextremists\u201d have no right to dictate what people should or should not eat. \u201cNobody on earth can force me to stop eating a food I like and beef is my favourite food,\u201d he said and urged people not to link beef to any religion. Some of the State\u2019s political parties and some social organisations have been exerting pressure on the government to not allow the rally in Meghalaya. The regional Voice of the People Party (VPP) said the yatra could disturb peace and communal harmony in the State. \u201cWhile we fully support and uphold the principle of freedom of religion as enshrined in our Constitution, we are deeply troubled by the potential implications such an event could have on communal harmony in our State,\u201d the VPP\u2019s Shillong MP Ricky J. Syngkon said in a letter written to Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma. \u201cThis yatra is a Hindu majoritarian communal attack on the pluralist and secular culture of India and Meghalaya,\u201d Angela Rangad of the Thma U Rangli Juki, an activist group, said. \u201cThe consumption of beef, also for religious purposes, is common among the communities in Meghalaya,\u201d she added. Earlier, Nagaland BJP president Benjamin Yepthomi said the party was against the rally whose objective \u201cdirectly interferes with the culture and dietary choices of the Nagas\u201d. Announcing their support for his stand, the party\u2019s Phek district unit said that in Naga custom, equating a mother to an animal was outrightly disrespectful and insulting to the revered position mothers occupy in the family and the society. \u201cAny forceful imposition or alteration to the rich customs and traditions of the Naga people poses a threat to the peace and harmony that the Nagas have cherished for generations,\u201d the unit said in a statement. The Nagaland government, of which the BJP is a constituent, subsequently decided not to grant permission to the organisers to hold the ostensibly anti-beef rally in the State. The All Arunachal Pradesh Students\u2019 Union also objected to the yatra, calling it an encroachment on the people\u2019s right to decide what to eat. Their Mizoram counterpart, the Mizo Zirlai Pawl also criticised the yatra organisers for advocating against the slaughter of cattle in the State.

            "content": "Aparshakti Khurana\u2019s latest film 'Berlin' has captivated audiences, racking up over 50 million watch minutes in just three days on a leading OTT platform. New Delhi: Aparshakti Khurana's latest film, 'Berlin', is making headlines for all the right reasons. The thriller-drama, which recently premiered on a leading OTT platform, has achieved a remarkable milestone by amassing over 50 million watch minutes within just three days of its release. In 'Berlin', Khurana takes on a challenging and unique role as Pushkin Verma, a sign language expert. This role is a departure from his previous performances and highlights his remarkable versatility as an actor. Critics and audiences alike have been praising his portrayal, which stands in stark contrast to his more familiar comedic and light-hearted roles. The film's success is mirrored by the enthusiastic reception it has received online. Aparshakti celebrated the film's reception on social media, where he was met with a flood of positive comments. One viewer remarked, \u201cWatched it last weekend. Really really good,\u201d while another added, \u201cAmazing work all of you!\u201d The performance of Rahul Bose, who also stars in the film, has been widely discussed, with many viewers lauding his powerful expressions. A post shared by Aparshakti Khurana (@aparshakti_khurana) The success of 'Berlin' adds to Khurana\u2019s growing list of achievements. Currently, he is also enjoying the success of the horror-comedy blockbuster 'Stree 2', where his portrayal of Bittu has been well-received by audiences and critics alike. Looking ahead, Khurana is preparing for the release of his upcoming film, 'Badtameez Gill', scheduled to hit theatres on November 29, 2024. The film will see him sharing the screen with prominent actors such as Paresh Rawal and Vaani Kapoor. Additionally, Khurana has a documentary titled 'Finding Ram' in the works, further showcasing his diverse talents. With 'Berlin' setting new benchmarks and his career continuously on the rise, Aparshakti Khurana is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with in the Indian film industry.",

            "content": "The Indian adaptation of The Traitors is currently in production in Jaisalmer's fort. Bollywood filmmaker will take the reins as host of the thrilling reality show that has become one of the most popular reality game show formats worldwide. With independent distributor All3Media International, Prime Video India will stream the Indian adaptation of IDTV\u2019s BAFTA and Emmy Award-winning global format, The Traitors, produced by BBC Studios India Productions. The Traitors, an unscripted original reality show, has become one of the world's fastest-growing reality game show formats, with over 20 countries participating. The exhilarating performance eventually boils down to trust and deception, testing the contestants' brains, humour, and strategic prowess as they vie for a hefty financial prize. 20 participants arrive in a royal palace, hoping to win the cash bounty accumulated via various physical and psychological objectives completed by them. Players will be labelled as 'innocents', but few of them will be 'traitors'. In a game of brutal twists and turns, cold-hearted deception, and relentless manipulation, the traitors must eliminate the innocents. Adding another feather to his cap, host Karan Johar stated, \"The Traitors is one of the most watched reality series, with its popularity growing all over the world as the audience laps up the riveting drama and entertainment.\" After seeing the UK and US versions, I've become an obsessive admirer of the concept and admire Claudia Winkleman and Alan Cumming, who host their respective shows with composure and dramatic theatrics that keep you on the edge of your seat. I'm quite excited to take on the role of host for the show's Indian rendition.\"",

            "content": "Atishi had long been considered the frontrunner to succeed Arvind Kejriwal as Delhi Chief Minister. She is currently holding the Education and PWD Ministeries and is poised to become the third woman CM in the AAP-led Delhi government. Atishi Marlena is set to become Delhi's new Chief Minister after Arvind Kejriwal's resignation. Her name was approved during a meeting of AAP's legislative assembly. This move comes after Kejriwal was granted bail in the Delhi liquor scam case but was forced to step down due to bail conditions. Atishi had long been considered the frontrunner to succeed Arvind Kejriwal as Delhi Chief Minister. She is currently holding the Education and PWD Ministeries and is poised to become the third woman CM in the AAP-led Delhi government. Here are five things to know about Delhi\u2019s incoming Chief Minister, Atishi: Born and Raised In A Scholarly Family Atishi Marlena, born on June 8, 1981, hails from a Punjabi Rajput family in Delhi. Both her parents, Vijay and Tripta Singh, are esteemed professors at Delhi University. Interestingly, her name 'Marlena' was inspired by revolutionary leaders Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, a nod to her father\u2019s ideological leanings. However, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Atishi dropped 'Marlena' and is now widely recognized by her first name. From Sisodia\u2019s Advisor To Delhi\u2019s Next CM Atishi\u2019s journey in politics began as an activist within the AAP, a party she has been associated with since its early days. In 2015, she was appointed as an advisor to Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, specifically aiding in the education sector. Her impact in shaping Delhi's education reforms gained her widespread recognition. After Sisodia's arrest in connection with the liquor scam, Atishi took charge of key portfolios, including education, continuing to build upon the foundation of reforms initiated under Sisodia. Setback In 2019 Lok Sabha Elections Despite her contributions to Delhi\u2019s education system, Atishi faced a tough political battle in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Running from the East Delhi constituency, she was defeated by BJP's Gautam Gambhir, losing by a margin of 477,000 votes. However, in 2020, she bounced back in the Delhi Assembly elections, securing a victory from the Kalkaji constituency. Strong Educational Background Atishi\u2019s academic journey is as impressive as her political career. She attended Springdales School in New Delhi before moving on to St. Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi University, where she graduated in 2001. Furthermore, she completed her post graduation from University of Oxford. After returning to India, she contributed her expertise to Rishi Valley School in Andhra Pradesh and later worked with the Sambhavana Institute of Public Policy, cementing her credentials as a leader with a robust academic foundation. Credited with Transforming Delhi\u2019s Education System Atishi\u2019s work in the education sector remains one of her most notable achievements. Under her guidance, Delhi\u2019s government schools saw a significant improvement in both infrastructure and quality of education. Her dedication to enhancing public education earned her praise not just within Delhi, but across India. As she steps into the role of Chief Minister, her vision for governance is expected to carry forward the reformist spirit that defined her previous roles.",

Israel has regularly launched airstrikes in response and has targeted and killed senior Hezbollah commanders. As recently as last month it appeared a full-blown war was imminent.The tit-for-tat strikes have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. Hezbollah has said it would halt the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but those talks have repeatedly bogged down. The United States has pressed for restraint even as it has rushed military aid to Israel, warning its close ally that a wider war would not achieve its goals.Israeli .",

To get it in your inbox, subscribe here .) Amazon mandates five days a week in office Amazon.com said it would require employees to return to the office five days per week , effective Jan. 2, 2025. The company further said it would bring back assigned desk arrangements in locations that were previously organized that way, including the U.S. headquarters locations. As part of an organizational restructuring, Amazon is looking to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. In May last year, employees at Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters staged a walkout protesting changes to the ecommerce giant\u2019s climate policy, layoffs and a return-to-office mandate. Meta bans Russian state media Facebook owner Meta said it was banning RT, Rossiya Segodnya and other Russian state media networks, alleging the outlets used deceptive tactics to carry out influence operations while evading detection on the social media company\u2019s platforms. The announcement comes days after Washington unveiled sanctions against Moscow backed outlets. The Biden administration also announced the launch of a diplomatic effort to alert international community to what U.S. officials have described as RT\u2019s role as \u201cfully-fledged member of the intelligence apparatus\u201d of Moscow. The ban will be rolled out on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads. Apple iPhone 16 faces weak demand Shares of Apple fell nearly 3% on Monday after some analysts said delivery times for the new iPhone 16 Pro models indicated weaker-than-expected demand , possibly due to the delayed rollout of key artificial intelligence features. Early pre-order data showed shorter global shipping times for the iPhone 16 Pro models compared with last year\u2019s 15 Pro models, three days after Apple started taking pre-orders. Apple Intelligence is set to arrive in the U.S. version of the English language in beta next month, and for other versions as late as next year, potentially keeping some customers on the fence about upgrading to the 16 series.

Out of the USD 2 billion, the ADB will give around USD 1 billion at a fixed 2 per cent rate under its concessional window.Despite having reached a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pakistan has become a desperate borrower in recent years, striking deals at unsustainably higher interest rate",

            "description": "The rupee appreciated 2 paise to 83.84 against the US dollar in early trade on Tuesday, helped by a weak greenback against major crosses overseas and lower crude oil prices in international markets.However, a sluggish trend in the domestic equities and fresh foreign fund outflows amid US rate cut expectations restricted the rise in the local unit, forex traders said.At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened slightly weak at 83.87 but gained some ground to turn positive at 83.84, registering a rise of 2 paise from its previous close.On Monday, the local unit settled at 83.86 against the US dollar.\"A decline in crude oil prices, (recent) healthy foreign institutional inflows into Indian equities, and speculation about a possible rate cut by the Federal Reserve have stirred hopes of stability. Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India is poised to step in around the crucial 84-mark, likely deploying its reserves to prevent a further slide in the rupee,\" said, Amit",

By having it in India, the organisers hope to help young Indian drivers stay in the country and do the series at a fraction of what it would cost to do the same category in Europe. While helping drivers is one part of the equation \u2014 and it remains to be seen how much it can improve \u2014 the league is having a more profound impact on another group of young Indians who want to have a career in motorsports. The drivers are the sport\u2019s protagonists, showing immense grit and bravery to throw around mean machines at eye-popping speeds with control and precision. Beating heart But there is another group of people who are actually the sport\u2019s beating heart, helping design and run these machines \u2014 the engineers. The cars used in the F4 and IRL are made in Europe, and engineers from abroad are needed to run them. For example, the F4 cars are run by a Dutch team called MP Motorsport, which competes in the feeder categories like the F2, F3 and a few regional F4 championships. But since last year, there has been an attempt to address this gap by adding more Indian engineers to the mix. During the first two rounds of the 2024 championship in Chennai, youngsters \u2014 graduates and those still pursuing their degrees \u2014 were seen working with laptops to download data and running with car parts up and down the pitlane. These students are part of the United Motorsports Academy (U.M.A.), an initiative started by a former F1 aerodynamist to help Indians become motorsport engineers. After undergoing a two-week course at U.M.A., they qualify for an internship in the IRL and F4 series as part of a scholarship called L.I.M.E. (Launchpad for Indian Motorsports Engineers). The enterprise is the brainchild of Shubham Sangodkar \u2014 who worked with the Red Bull Racing F1 championship-winning team in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 and Omkar Rane. Shubham Sangodkar.| Photo Credit:Siva Sankar Arokaran \u201cAfter returning to India, I started giving guest lectures, and the problems I saw 10 years ago were still there in that there was no real platform for someone who wants to be a motorsport engineer,\u201d Sangodkar explained on what prompted him to start U.M.A. \u201cSo I took a step back to see what I can do. I did some career counselling and recorded an online course that went viral, which has 1200 students,\u201d he added. \u201cBut, there is a bigger problem to solve, and that\u2019s how U.M.A. came up. I then collaborated with Akhilesh Reddy and Aditya Patel (the co-founders of the IRL), and they wanted to do this as well. So, I offered to take up this vertical.\u201d For Sangodkar, the aim in four to five years is for Indians to make up 80% of the engineers in the F4 India championship. \u201cMy vision is to create a programme that allows us to do that. Last year, we did a four-day programme, which was not optimised because of the timing. But this year, we could do what we wanted to last year,\u201d said the former Red Bull engineer. As part of that, U.M.A. conducted a 13-day workshop earlier this year for a cohort of 146 applicants, which involved an equal number of days for theory and practical training in Mumbai. Photo Credit: Siva Sankar Arokaran The course was conducted by Rex Keen, a former race engineer and technical director who has worked in various motorsports categories. It was held at the D&O Motorsports garage, where the students got classes on one side and hands-on experience on the other side of the garage. At the end of the course, the students took an open-book test, in which 24 qualified for the L.I.M.E. scholarship to do an internship this year at F4 and IRL. Even last year, 24 students graduated from L.I.M.E. 1.0, some of whom are back for a second time this year. The students learnt about corner balancing, wheel torques, the architecture of an open-wheel car, and double-wishbone suspension. This season, 36 people who have come through this programme are currently involved. These interns do everything the chief mechanic asks, from noting track temperatures and tyre pressure throughout the day to helping adjust set-ups. Seven junior race engineers in this cohort do all the data work after the sessions. Going forward, Sangodkar said the aim is to create the next lap of the ladder and nurture this talent. \u201cL.I.M.E. is right now an identification and upskilling programme. My vision is to nurture talent and provide 100 opportunities for motorsport volunteering at a high level in this country, and out of that, take 10-15 abroad and provide the opportunity.\u201d \u201cPeople who do this, their resumes stand out. Whether it is a scholarship you are looking for while applying abroad or a differentiation in the market when trying to get a job with the big manufacturers, it helps,\u201d Sangodkar added. Photo Credit: Siva Sankar Arokaran Success stories One of the success stories of the L.I.M.E. programme is Mrugank Divekar, who participated last year and is working in the FIA F2 series. Divekar, who impressed his engineer during the 2023 season, was referred to work in the upcoming F1 movie starring Hollywood star Brad Pitt. The opportunity to get onto the F1 grid during shooting helped Divekar network and eventually land a job in F2. Marc Stephen, a third-year Mechanical and Automotive engineering student from VIT Vellore, is doing this internship for the second year. \u201cLast year, I was with the F4 championship, and it was about observing and learning. This year, I get to work on the car. I am the primary data engineer for the Kolkata team in IRL. So, after every session, we check reliability and collect data,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cWhat we are learning here correlates to what we study in college. You never learn something like this anywhere else. In mechatronics, there is something called Electronically Controlled Solenoids. We saw that being used here. Similarly, we opened up an engine and did a compression test. These are stuff you read about in college, and we are doing that here.\u201d Pranav Rao, a fourth-year engineering student from Bengaluru who is also doing this internship for the second year, credits the U.M.A. for coming up with such an initiative. \u201cWhat we do here is the a-b-c-d of putting the car together. We are doing data work, understanding the car inside out, the tyres, driver coaching and psychology. We get to sit with MP Motorsport guys and learn how a race weekend goes. These guys won the F2 championship last year. So this is an amazing platform. \u201cDuring the two-week course, we started by understanding suspension systems, a bit of aero, and vehicle dynamics and brushed up on our basics. Our mentor Rex Keen has been drilling us with a lot of knowledge, and because of that, our basics are solid,\u201d he added. Akshara Vinjamuri, a third-year Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering student from Symbiosis Institute of Technology, was a trackside engineer last year and is a junior race assistant engineer in the F4 category this year. \u201cThis year, I got to do many more things and have more responsibility. My job is to sit with the chief engineer and understand how he handles the weekend. They do data and the knick-knacks of cars. They predict what to do and what will happen next,\u201d explained Akshara. \u201cThere is a lot of analysis, which I\u2019m picking upon. You can\u2019t learn analysis because everyone has their own thought process. I am here to understand what my thought process is and how I can put that into practice. I see what my engineer is telling the driver so I can handle it myself in the future. It is a great learning curve. You can\u2019t rote learn, but you must understand,\u201d she added. Photo Credit: Siva Sankar Arokaran Akshara also felt the L.I.M.E. programme is a great way to have more women in motorsports. \u201cI would like other women to follow my path. If there is any woman interested in motorsports, they should come to U.M.A.\u201d India, especially South India, is known to produce thousands of engineers every year. So why hasn\u2019t motorsport engineering taken off? According to Sangodkar, one reason is that the mechanical engineering department is undervalued in Indian colleges. \u201cThe mechanical engineering department is one-tenth of the size of Computer Science or IT. So colleges and universities are finding it difficult to run it qualitatively because the fees pay for the equipment and professors.\u201d \u201cIf we can infuse motorsports as part of the curriculum in mechanical engineering, we can make it attractive and lucrative. But it needs a sustained push,\u201d he said. The programme is open to applicants over the age of 16, and students do not necessarily need an engineering background. Sangodkar even cites an example of a student from a commerce background who has a passion for motorsport and came second in the test. \u201cIt is the vision that we collectively have at U.M.A. and RRPL. Together, we want to build the entire ecosystem, and we can\u2019t have one without a strong grassroots. There is good support from RRPL and scope for taking a few junior race engineers and mechanics to a championship in the UAE or elsewhere. When that happens, you get calls from race engineers to come and work for one or two race weekends, and that\u2019s how this ecosystem grows. In four or five years, you will have enough Indians within this ecosystem, and it will grow,\u201d Sangodkar said as he signed off on a hopeful note.

Early Monday, after taking down the post about the apparent Trump assassination, the 53-year-old billionaire wrote on the platform: \u201cWell, one lesson I've learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X.\u201d The original post was in response to DogeDesigner, one of the 700 accounts that Musk follows, who asked: \u201cWhy they want to kill Donald Trump?\u201d Musk's reply was quickly condemned by many X users, and \u201cDeportElonMusk\u201d began trending on X on Monday morning. \u201cViolence should only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about,\u201d said White House spokesperson Andrew Bates in response to mr.

            "description": "Embracing QNLP and QGen-AI, and advancements in time-series forecasting, can pave the way for more efficient and performant AI systems",
            "content": "In recent years, the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly within the realm of natural language processing (NLP), has undergone a remarkable transformation. We have witnessed the rise of powerful large language models (LLMs) made by OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, among others, and generative AI (Gen-AI), characterised by its unparalleled ability to generate data based on user inputs. These sophisticated models have revolutionised human-computer interactions, bestowing upon users experiences akin to human understanding. The advent of these cutting-edge technologies and their wide availability has compelled the people at large, industry stakeholders, and governmental bodies to pay attention to their implications. Problems with current LLMs LLMs are a cornerstone in AI and mirror the complexities of human language processing. They can classify text, answer questions, and translate between languages. But they also consume a lot of energy to be trained and when put in use. For example, as models go, LLMs are much larger than other AI applications such as computer vision. The energy consumption of a large language model (LLM) is determined mostly by the number of parameters it has. Larger models demand more computational power for both training and inference. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters and required around 1,287 MWh of electricity to train. This is around what an average American household consumes in 120 years. LLMs also surpass non-AI applications in this regard. Training an LLM with 1.75 billion parameters can emit up to 284 tonnes of carbon dioxide, which represents more energy than that required to run a data centre with 5,000 servers for a year. It\u2019s important that we lower LLMs\u2019 carbon footprint to ensure they are sustainable and cost-effective. Achieving these goals will give LLMs more room to become more sophisticated as well. Another shortcoming of LLMs pertains to their pre-trained nature, which restricts the level of control users have over their functioning. These models are trained on large datasets with which they develop awareness of word-use patterns in diverse linguistic contexts. But such training often also results in \u201challucinations\u201d. Essentially, LLMs may generate text that is contextually coherent but factually incorrect or semantically nonsensical. This arises from limitations inherent to the training, when the model\u2019s understanding may diverge from reality. A third limitation revolves around the abilities of current LLMs to understand syntactics. Syntax refers to the structural arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence. LLMs excel at processing the semantic (meaning-related) aspects of natural language but struggle with syntax. For example, they may overlook or misinterpret syntactic cues and impede their ability to generate contextually appropriate text. In sum, we need to develop sustainable, energy-efficient approaches that yield more accurate language models. Quantum computing Quantum computing is a highly promising way to address these challenges. It harnesses the remarkable properties of quantum physics like superposition and entanglement for computational needs. In particular, quantum natural language processing (QNLP) has emerged as an active and burgeoning field of research with potentially profound implications for language modelling. QNLP incurs lower energy costs than conventional LLMs by leveraging quantum phenomena. QNLP models also require far fewer parameters than their classical counterparts in order to achieve the same outcomes (on paper), thus promising to enhance efficiency without compromising performance. This processing paradigm takes advantage of quantum correlations, an approach in which the system focuses on grammar (syntax) and meaning (semantics) together, rather than separately as conventional systems do. QNLP achieves this using a better \u2018mapping\u2019 between the rules of grammar and quantum physical phenomena like entanglement and superposition. The result is a deeper, more complete understanding of language. The approach is also expected to mitigate the \u201challucinations\u201d that plague many existing LLMs, as the resulting QNLP models are better equipped to distinguish the contexts of various pieces of information and produce more accurate outputs. With the help of QNLP, researchers also hope to uncover the mental processes that allow us to understand and create sentences, yielding new insights into how language works in the mind. Time-series forecasting From the basic details of quantum mechanics, we learn that a quantum system (like an atom or a group of particles) can be described by a quantum state \u2014 a mathematical representation that keeps evolving with time. By studying this representation, we can determine the expected outcomes of an experiment involving that system. Based on the same idea, researchers have proposed a quantum generative model to work with time-series data. A generative model is a mathematical model that generates data, if required with a user\u2019s inputs. A general model designed to run on a quantum computer is a quantum generative model (QGen). Here, the techniques of quantum computing can be used to create or analyse sophisticated time-series data that conventional computers struggle with. Time-series data is data of something that has been recorded at fixed intervals. This new data can then be used to teach quantum algorithms to identify patterns in the data more efficiently, to solve complex problems related to forecasting (e.g. stock market trends), and/or to detect anomalies. On May 20, 2024 , researchers in Japan reported that a QGen AI model they built could successfully work with both stationary and nonstationary data. Stationary data refers to information that doesn\u2019t change much over time. It stays fairly constant or fluctuates around a stable average. For example, the current price of a commodity like gold or the world\u2019s population can be considered stationary: the data doesn\u2019t show big changes in trends over a short period and the values move within a predictable range. On the other hand, nonstationary data keep changing, such as ambient temperature, stock prices, and the GDP. Classical methods struggle to analyse such data accurately. In the new study, the researchers built a time-series QGen AI model and evaluated its performance by applying it to solve plausible financial problems. They wrote in their preprint paper: \u201cFuture data for two correlated time series were generated and compared with classical methods such as long short-term memory and vector autoregression. Furthermore, numerical experiments were performed to complete missing values. Based on the results, we evaluated the practical applications of the time-series quantum generation model. It was observed that fewer parameter values were required compared with the classical method. In addition, the quantum time-series generation model was feasible for both stationary and nonstationary data.\u201d That fewer parameters were required means the model based on the quantum computer could solve the same problems as a classical computer but while requiring less computational resources. In sum, quantum computing holds considerable potential to revolutionise AI applications, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by current LLMs. By embracing QNLP and QGen-AI, together with advancements in time-series forecasting, we can pave the way for sustainable, efficient, and performant AI systems.

Thiruvalluvar asks: \u201cOf what use is your intelligence if you do not see another person\u2019s suffering as your own, and try to provide relief?\u201d Thirumoolar had spiritual jnana, which he wanted to impart to the world. He says that he composed his Thirumantiram for the benefit of the world. Not content with having acquired jnana himself, he wanted everyone to have jnana. Thiruvalluvar says that the learned will want to study more, when they find that their learning brings joy to others too. Thirumoolar said that what was offered to man would reach God. So, if we offer food to the hungry, it is like offering food to God Himself. Vallalar was moved when he saw withering crops. He prayed that he should have love towards all living beings. There were kings in Tamil Nadu, who showed their concern not just for human beings, but for all living things in unique ways. One day King Pegan saw a peacock getting drenched in the rain. He did not want the peacock to feel cold, and put his shawl around it. King Paari saw a jasmine creeper lying on the ground. He picked it up and draped it around his royal chariot. People might argue that, instead, he could have built an arch for the creeper to climb on. But that would have taken time. The king provided immediate relief to the creeper, by offering it his chariot. Published - September 17, 2024 05:19 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "As the Maharashtra Congress works to position itself as the leading force within the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections, internal strife has surfaced due to instances of unresolved organisational indiscipline. A recent incident underscores the problem. It happened when the party\u2019s newly elected MP from Chandrapur, Pratibha Dhanorkar, attended a Kunbi community event in the Brahmapuri Assembly constituency, which is represented by party leader and Leader of the Opposition, Vijay Wadettiwar. The event, also attended by BJP MLC Parinay Phuke, saw Dhanorkar advocating support for a Kunbi candidate, irrespective of political affiliation. She appealed to attendees, saying, \u201cRegardless of the party \u2014 whether Shiv Sena, NCP, BJP, or Congress \u2014 let\u2019s focus on electing a candidate from our community.\u201d Also read | Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders stay united ahead of Assembly polls, say Pawar, Aaditya Thackeray Mr. Wadettiwar and other senior Congress leaders brought the matter to the attention of the party\u2019s leadership in New Delhi. Mr. Wadettiwar, a member of the minority Teli community, has already faced issues with Ms. Dhanorkar\u2019s camp, who accused him of undermining her Lok Sabha election campaign after his daughter, Shivani, was denied a ticket. Ms. Dhanorkar\u2019s comments were seen as an effort to challenge Mr. Wadettiwar\u2019s influence within the party. In response, the Congress leadership stepped in to mediate. AICC mediation Sources told The Hindu that AICC in-charge General Secretary (Organisation) K.C. Venugopal \u201csummoned\u201d both leaders and asked them to set aside their differences and cooperate. The meeting, held in New Delhi on Saturday, aimed to resolve the rivalry and foster unity within the ranks. \u201cFirstly, he (Mr. Venugopal) questioned her about why she attended a meeting in the Brahmapuri constituency, which is outside her jurisdiction. He also asked how she could urge the gathering to support a Kunbi candidate from any party, while she herself represents the Congress, especially considering the constituency is already represented by a party colleague,\u201d said a Congress inside. Though the constituency is located in Chandrapur district, it is part of Gadchiroli\u2013Chimur Lok Sabha constituency. BJP exploits rift The issue became further complicated by BJP MLC Mr. Phuke\u2019s announcement that he would ask Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a Kunbi candidate from Brahmapuri. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Wadettiwar confirmed the meeting and said he did not file any formal complaint against her. He acknowledged that senior Congress leaders, including AICC in-charge of Maharashtra, Ramesh Chennithala, raised the issue in Delhi. Ms. Dhanorkar did not respond to repeated calls from The Hindu for comment. The internal discord within the party has been aggravated by growing frustrations among members. Congress leaders said the lack of action against legislators accused of crossvoting during MLC polls, which contributed to the defeat of the MVA candidate, is not helping. Further complicating matters, Congress MLA Zeeshan Siddique was recently spotted attending Deputy CM Ajit Pawar\u2019s Jan Sanman Yatra, raising additional concerns about party discipline. Though State Congress President Nana Patole said two MLAs, Mr. Siddique and Jitesh Antapurkar, have been expelled from the party, no official statement was issued. \u201cI\u2019m still a Congressman; no action has been taken against me. I did not get any written communication about being expelled,\u201d Mr. Siddique, who represents Bandra (East) constituency in Mumbai told The Hindu . He is the son of former Congress leader Baba Siddique, who joined the Nationalist Congress Party led by Mr. Ajit Pawar.

            "content": "Madras, Sept. 16: The Southern Railway authorities are concerned over the growing menace of alarm chain pulling which has upset the punctuality of trains in the broad gauge sections of the Madras Division. There has been a significant rise in the number of such incidents in recent months. From 501 in July, the figure rose to 579 in August. It is unlikely to go up still further in September, the tally for the first ten days being 233. A study of the figures shows the Gudur-Madras section accounted for the largest number \u2014 153 out of 233 reported till September 10 \u2014 and the incidents occurred mostly between Tiruvottiyur and Ennore stations. Railway sources attribute the spurt in the number of chain pullings to increased smuggling of rice from Andhra centres in the context of rice scarcity and high prices in Madras. The smugglers, it is said, pulled the alarm chain to unload the stocks midway between stations. The re-imposition of Prohibition in Tamil Nadu from September 1 has given rise to smuggling of liquor also from Andhra Pradesh in recent weeks, according to a Railway spokesman. Yet another matter agitating the Railways is the cases of assault on train crew reported from this section. The driver of a Madras-Gummidipundi local sustained head injuries yesterday, as a result of stone-throwing by a group of persons standing beside the track between Tiruvottiyur and Ennore.

It added that the Consulate \u201cis in touch with the community and has raised the matter with the US law enforcement authorities for prompt action against the perpetrators of this heinous act\u201d. Melville is located in Suffolk County on Long Island and is about 28 kilometres from the 16000-seater Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address a mega community event on September 22. According to footage shared online, expletives have been sprayed on the road and the signage outside the temple. The temple is expected to hold a prayer meeting later in the afternoon following the incident. The Hindu American Foundation said in a post on X that the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security \u201cmust investigate\u201d the attack on the temple \u201cafter recent threats to Hindu institutions as a large Indian community gathering is planned in nearby Nassau County this weekend\u201d. \u201cIt is hard to comprehend the absolute cowardice of those who would attack a Hindu temple to air hatred for an elected leader. This attack, following recent threats at Hindu and Indian institutions, must be seen in the context of that threat scenario,\u201d executive director of the Hindu American Foundation Suhag Shukla said in a post on X.

            "content": "The Bihar Police on Monday (September 16, 2024) arrested two persons for waving India\u2019s national flag with a \u2018crescent moon and star\u2019 in place of the Ashoka Chakra during the procession of Milad-un-Nabi in Saran district. Police in Saran said that the act is a violation of Section 2 of the Indian Flag Code, 2002, which states that anyone who intentionally disrespects the national flag in any public place or in any other place within public view is a punishable offence. On Monday morning, a video surfaced on social media in which the tricolour flag with a moon and star instead of the Ashoka Chakra was being waved during a Milad-un-Nabi procession in Kopa Bazaar under Kopa police station of Saran district. After the video went viral, the police took immediate action and detained the two youths. \u201cToday, in the case of hoisting of the tricolour flag in a so-called modified form by replacing the Ashoka Chakra with a moon and a star in the Milad-un-Nabi procession under the Kopa police station, the police team took immediate action and seized the alleged flag along with the pick-up vehicle. Two people who were waving the flag have been arrested. One more person is involved in the case who has provided the flag to them. We are conducting raids to nab that person as well,\u201d Saran Superintendent of Police Kumar Ashish said during the media briefing in Chapra. Asked about the reason behind waving such a flag, Mr. Ashish further said: \u201cAs of now, we don\u2019t know the possible reason but mishandling with the national symbol and national flag itself is a crime and [officials] will take strict action against them. Apart from Section 153 of the BNS, the act is also a violation of Indian Flag Code, 2002.\u201d Published - September 17, 2024 03:22 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Bihar / police",

He was speaking at an event in Mumbai on Sunday (September 15, 2024). \u201cOur institutions: the Election Commission, investigative agencies, and others work in trying situations. An observation can dispirit them. It can start a political debate. It can trigger a narrative. We have to be extremely cautious about all our institutions,\u201d he said in his speech. The comments come after recent observations by the Supreme Court about the CBI in the matter of the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. The apex court had observed that the CBI must be above board, and it must dispel the notion of it being a caged parrot. He said this was avoidable. \u201cThey [the institutions] are robust. They are working independently. There are checks and balances. They work under the rule of law. In that situation, it might work in a manner to generate some sensation, to become the focal point of a political debate or a narrative. That I will appeal to those concerned is wholly avoidable.\u201d The VP was talking to young students. He said that all institutions and organs of the State worked with the underlying goal of making the Constitution successful. \u201cAll organs of state \u2014 judiciary, legislature, executive \u2014 have only one goal. That the intention underlying the Constitution should be successful. The common man should get all the rights. India should flourish. They need to work in tandem and togetherness to nurture democratic values and further constitutional ideals.\u201d He also pointed out the limitations of each organ. \u201cAn institution is well served when it is conscious of certain limitations. Some limitations are obvious. Some limitations are very fine, subtle. This announces the sublimity and efficacy of our State,\u201d he said.

His remarks assume significance in the backdrop of Sirsa MP Kumari Sejla, one of the top contenders for the CM post in the Congress, not contesting the coming Assembly election. Without naming former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Mr. Surjewala, in a viral clip, told a news channel that the party had made an MP the Chief Minister in 2005. He said the party\u2019s MLAs and the high command would decide on the party\u2019s next Chief Minister at the right time if Congress was voted to power. Both, Ms. Selja and Mr. Surjewala had expressed their desire to contest the Assembly poll, but the party had decided not the field any of its MPs.

The interrogation is likely to continue late in the night, he added. Both Ghosh and Mondal are in CBI custody till September 17.

            "content": "Asserting that the first 100 days of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government has been marked by \u201cU-turns\u201d, the Congress on Monday said that Mr. Modi in his third term has proven to be a \u201cweak\u201d Prime Minister. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate, who heads the party\u2019s social media department, said the government\u2019s first 100 days have been marked by \u201cinstability, indecisiveness and immaturity\u201d. She said this period has weighed heavily on the nation\u2019s farmers, youth, women, infrastructure, Railways, and overall peace. Ms. Shrinate said that the Prime Minister\u2019s relationship with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has soured, there is intense infighting within the BJP and the government lacked direction. \u201cDo you remember the tall claims made during the election campaign that Narendra Modi was planning for the first 100 days? Where is that plan now? Because from day one, Modi has proven to be a weak Prime Minister, dependent on crutches, setting new records for U-turns,\u201d she said. Ms. Shrinate referred to the shelving of the plan to hire bureaucrats through the lateral entry route, putting the broadcast Bill on the backburner, sending the Waqf Board Bill to a Joint Parliamentary Committee, going back on the proposal to hike long term capital gains and indexation and announcing the Unified Pension Scheme in place of the National Pension System as examples of U-turns. Raising queries about the Prime Minister\u2019s plan or vision for the next five years, Ms. Shrinate asked, \u201cDo you have a plan to improve relations with our neighbouring countries? Do you have a plan to address the economy, income inequality, unemployment, inflation, or women\u2019s safety?\u201d She also talked about the recent flare-up in Manipur where rocket-propelled grenades and drones are being used in attacks, protesters from Ladakh marching towards Delhi to raise the issue of alleged Chinese incursions, economic situation deteriorating with the rupee at a historic low, foreign direct investment (FDI) down 43% and unemployment rate at an eight-month record high. Talking about the Railways, she said there had been 38 train accidents, resulting in 21 deaths and more than 112 persons injured, in the past 100 days. Similarly, she said there have been 26 terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir that left 21 soldiers and 15 civilians dead while scores were injured. Ms. Shrinate said 56 major infrastructure projects, including airports, bridges, roads, and statues that were inaugurated recently have crumbled. \u201cThe Jabalpur airport, Delhi, and Rajkot airports couldn\u2019t withstand a single rain. [Chhatrapati] Shivaji\u2019s statue broke within eight months. The leaking roof of the new Parliament building with water falling into buckets below is evidence of failure,\u201d she claimed. Water is leaking inside the sanctum sanctorum of Ram temple in Ayodhya and the \u20b918,000-crore Atal Setu bridge in Mumbai has developed cracks, the Congress spokesperson claimed.

            "content": "In a setback for the BJP Rajya Sabha (RS) MP from Himachal Pradesh, Harsh Mahajan, the HP High Court on Monday (September 16, 2024) upheld the maintainability of the petition filed by Congress RS MP from Telangana and senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi challenging the RS election results in the State. Mr. Singhvi was defeated by Mr. Mahajan. Mr. Singhvi moved the HC in April this year, challenging the interpretation of rules in the process of results declaration in polls held in February for the only RS seat in HP. Only two leaders were contesting, and it was a tie as both Mr. Singhvi and Mr. Mahajan, a Congress turncoat, secured 34 votes each. The winner was then announced by a draw of lots, which returned Mr. Singhvi\u2019s name, but the returning officer (RO) added that one vote to the kitty of the respondent, who was consequently declared the winner. Procedural \u2018mistake\u2019 Mr. Singhvi\u2019s loss came as a major embarrassment for the ruling Congress party in HP that had 40 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. However, six Congress MLAs voted for Mr. Mahajan, their old aide, and even the independents voted for the BJP candidate. Mr. Singhvi, in his petition, contested whether the RO relied on the correct rules for carrying out the draw of lots to choose the candidate. The petitioner also contended that the RO ought to have relied upon Section 65 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 rather than Rule 75 and Rule 81(3) of the Election Rules, 1961. After Mr. Singhvi\u2019s petition, Mr. Mahajan also approached the HC, stating that material facts have not been stated in the petition filed by Mr. Singhvi and that his plea does not disclose any cause of action against the respondent. \u201cThe petition is also barred by principles of estoppel and waiver,\u201d Mr. Mahajan\u2019s application stated. The bench of Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua maintained the election petition filed by Mr. Singhvi discloses all material facts as required to be disclosed in law, and that the law does not obligate the petitioner to project the respondent\u2019s case in his petition. The Court also stated that the petition clearly disclosed a cause of action as well and noted that it cannot be said at this stage that the result of the election had not been materially affected by the alleged non-compliance with the provisions. \u201cIn view of the above discussion, I find no merit in any of the contentions raised by the respondent to reject the election petition filed by the petitioner,\u201d the court noted. Singhvi\u2019s lawyers were senior advocates P. Chidambaram and Prashanto Chandra Sen.

But, she has not taken a decision for the Principal Health Secretary, based on our points surrounding evidence tampering and the threat culture and corruption in the healthcare system,\u201d Debasish Halder, one of the protesting doctors said right after the meeting concluded. \u201cIt is because the safety and security issues are not only external, they also stem from internal threat culture, mafia culture, and other corrupt, unethical practices that exist in the hospitals,\u201d Mr Halder said. \u201cFor that we need a democratic forum to be able to uproot these entirely, and for this, we have kept doors open for further discussion.\u201d Kinjal Nanda, one of the PGT doctors from RGKHC thanked the support of common people in the movement. \u201cIt is you who has helped us keep the movement going and keep our spine in place.

            "content": "The Supreme Court has struck down the detention of a person under the anti-smuggling law on learning that the jail authorities delayed sending his representation against the restraining order for nine months. A three-judge Bench headed by Justice B.R. Gavai, in a 60-page judgment, found the conduct of the jail authorities \u201ccallous and casual\u201d. The prison officials had opted to send the detenu\u2019s representation by ordinary post rather than email it. Justice Gavai, who authored the judgment, ordered the man to be released forthwith, observing that \u201cin matters pertaining to personal liberty of the citizens, the authorities are enjoined with a constitutional obligation to decide the representation with utmost expedition. Each day\u2019s delay matters in such a case\u201d. Kochu Mohammed Shaji was detained on August 31 last year under the provisions of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974, to \u201cprevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the augmentation of foreign exchange in future\u201d. Mr. Shaji was taken into custody on September 2, 2023, and put in detention in Central Prisons at Poojapura in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The judgment said the conduct of the prison authorities violated the detenu\u2019s right under Article 22(5) of the Constitution. \u201cPrison authorities should ensure that the representations are sent to the competent authorities immediately after the receipt thereof. In the present era of technological development, the representation can be sent through email within a day,\u201d Justice Gavai observed.

            "content": "Olympic medallists Sakshi Malik and Aman Sehrawat, along with former world championship bronze-winner Geeta Phogat, on Monday (September 16, 2024) announced that they would soon launch a Wrestling Champions Super League (WCSL) for the country's budding grapplers but the national federation has refused to sanction the initiative. Sakshi, along with Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, had spearheaded the wrestlers' protest against ousted Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who was accused of sexual harassment. She has, however, distanced herself from the latter two after they took the political plunge by joining Congress ahead of next month's Haryana assembly elections. She won the 58kg bronze in 2016 Rio Olympics, and announced the project with Phogat, a 55kg bronze winner in 2012 World Championships through their social media handles. The two, while announcing that they had Paris Games bronze-winner Aman on board, did not provide any details. Phogat told PTI that she is hopeful of support from the federation and the government. \"Sakshi and I have been planning this League for long. Soon it will take a final shape. We have not yet spoken to the WFI but it would be great if WFI and government support us. It will be the first league that will be operated only by the players,\" Phogat said. \"We are doing it for the players, for their benefit. That is the idea and vision, so no one should have any problem with it. It's a proud moment for us. We won't stop anyone from getting involved in it, if WFI or government comes on board, even better. We have not yet spoken to them. \"There will be international wrestlers, and coaches involved, so it should help our junior wrestlers. They will get good exposure.\" The WFI said it would not give its sanction to the league. \"We won't approve it. We are reviving our pro wrestling league and hopefully we will have it soon. The wrestlers are free to do their own league, they can promote the game, but we won't be linked with that,\" WFI President Sanjay Singh said. Asked if there will be prize money involved, and about the format and venue for the event, Phogat said, \"You will have to wait a bit to know all this. We will share the details very soon.\" Sakshi, who retired from wrestling after Sharan Singh's close aide Sanjay Singh became WFI head, said she hopes to give back to the sport through this initiative. \"The only way to repay your trust is to dedicate our sporting talent, experience, grit & success to the service of the sport. The 2 of us have therefore come together to create the Wrestling Champions Super League (WCSL),\" she posted on X. \"The WCSL, a world class international league, will skill & strengthen our wrestlers to dominate the sport globally by taking on the world's best in a hyper competitive, expertly supervised environment with best-in-class support systems in place.\" She also said that Sehrawat, who won bronze in 57kg in Paris Olympics, also \"shares our vision and is joining us on this journey.\" \"This league is a very commendable initiative which will help Indian wrestling greatly and therefore I want to be a part of it and support it fully,\" Aman was uoted as saying by Sakshi. Daughter of noted wrestling coach Mahavir, Geeta is a cousin of Vinesh, who will be contesting from Julana constituency during the Haryana elections. Sakshi said the aim of the league is to build a culture of sustained high performance in the sport in the country. \"While WCSL is focused on wrestling, it is inspired also by our overwhelming urge to build a culture of sustained high performance in Indian sport & motivate every Indian to experience the joy of playing. \"Although founded by the 2 of us, the WCSL is a national mission committed to respecting & working in close partnership with all stakeholders. Winning, afterall, is a team sport. Our hearts beat only for India, for Indian wrestling & for Indian sport. Come, let's build the sporting India of our dreams mil ke, ek saath!\" Published - September 17, 2024 02:19 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit wrestling",

            "description": "Sharma, who was in the top-15 after the first two days, ended with a total of 4-over 288",
            "content": "Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma had a choppy back nine leading to a round of 1-over 72 as he finished a disappointing T-42nd at the Amgen Irish Open at Royal County Down. Sharma, who was in the top-15 after the first two days, ended with a total of 4-over 288. He parred through the front nine and two more holes before finding his first birdie on the 12th. He bogeyed 13th and the 15th but birdied 16th only to drop a shot on 17th and close with a par. Meanwhile, Rasmus H\u00f8jgaard holed out twice and produced a stunning finish with four birdies in last five holes as he beat local favourite Rory McIlroy. McIlroy looked on course to claim his first professional win on home soil when he led by two shots with four holes to play at a venue just an hour from where he grew up. However, H\u00f8jgaard's superb closing 65 saw him claim his fifth DP World Tour title and move to second in the Race to Dubai Rankings and to the top of the European Ryder Cup standings. McIlroy had taken a one-shot lead into the final round and made the ideal start with birdies on the first and second. With playing partner Matteo Manassero then dropping shots on the third and fourth, McIlroy briefly enjoyed a four-shot lead before making a bogey on the seventh after failing to get up and down from left of the green. He then missed from inside ten feet for birdie on both the eighth and the ninth as H\u00f8jgaard kickstarted his challenge with an outrageous chip-in for birdie on the tenth. A birdie on the 11th edged McIlroy two in front again, but that advantage was wiped out as H\u00f8jgaard birdied the 16th and McIlroy bogeyed the 15th. H\u00f8jgaard then dramatically holed out from a greenside bunker on the 17th and, although McIlroy drew level with a birdie on the 16th, he charged his birdie putt on the 17th past the hole and missed the return. H\u00f8jgaard's third birdie in a row on the 18th meant McIlroy needed to make an eagle on the same hole to force a play-off and a towering approach from 191 yards gave him a chance from 15 feet, only for the eagle putt to slide just wide. \u201cI was nervous. I was shaking out there the last few holes. I obviously knew that Rory was going to be there because he's got the whole support on his back there. It was nerve-wracking going down the last few holes knowing that he was right behind me,\u201d H\u00f8jgaard said.

            "content": "Champions Inter Milan were knocked off the Serie A summit on Sunday (September 15, 2024) after they came from behind to play out a surprise 1-1 draw at lowly Monza. Monza took the lead in the 81st minute through substitute forward Dany Mota, who headed the ball into the top corner before Denzel Dumfries levelled for Inter in the 88th from close range. Inter, who drew at Genoa in their season opener followed by wins against Lecce and Atalanta, dropped to second in the table with eight points after four games. They are one point behind Napoli, who beat Cagliari 4-0 earlier on Sunday. Simone Inzaghi's men next travel to Manchester City on Wednesday to kick off their Champions League campaign before they host AC Milan in the league next Sunday. There were no early signs of trouble for Inter, who were patiently building play from the back, controlling the pace of the game. Lautaro Martinez should have put them in front inside the opening 10 minutes, when he received a perfect cross from Federico Dimarco. His header from the centre of the box, however, sailed slightly above bar before Dimarco and Davide Frattesi also had their chances early on. But Monza's calm defence did not leave the visitors much space and they went on to earn a shock lead as Mota nodded home from a neat lofted cross from Armando Izzo. Inter intensified their efforts and defender Dumfries equalised with first touch two minutes from time, tapping a low cross from Carlos Augusto, but lacked time to find a winner. Monza, who drew with Empoli and Fiorentina either side of their home loss to Genoa, are 15th with three points. They still await first win under new coach and former Milan defender Alessandro Nesta as they are now winless in their last 13 Serie A games, the longest ongoing run of any side currently in the top flight.

            "content": "Two prominent journalists of Bangladesh , known for their work in both print and TV, were arrested by the police on Monday (September 16, 2024) morning in Mymensingh. Editor of Bhorer Kagoj Shyamal Datta, and Muzammil Babu, Managing Director and Chief Editor of Ekattor TV , one of the biggest TV channels in Dhaka, were surrounded by a mob who took them to a police station in the district, sources have informed. They were subsequently taken to Dhaka. Mr. Datta is known for extensive coverage of India-Bangladesh relations and has often courted controversy for his revealing reports and analyses. Similarly, the Muzamil Babu-led Ekattor TV is known for its coverage of the South Asian scenario. Both journalists have travelled extensively across the world and had visited India on June 21 during the state visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Both are known to have extensive contacts regarding Bangladesh\u2019s political scenario. Dozens of journalists have had cases lodged against them in Bangladesh in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the arrests of Mr. Datta and Mr. Babu are believed to be related to some of the cases that pertain to the period of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. A source in Bangladesh pointed out that genocide cases have been lodged against Ms. Hasina for her role in the killing of protesters during July-August 2024 and the two senior media professionals have been arrested for remarks that they might have made regarding the protest.

However, Monday\u2019s arrest in Dhobaura of Mymensing bordering Meghalaya triggered speculation that both were planning to cross into India. Ekattor TV was earlier attacked by a mob on 5 August that had burnt down the studio and other facilities belonging to the channel. Subsequently, the channel revived itself and resumed its telecast.

A post on Instagram, accompanied by a video that played lyrics of popular songs by the singer, warned people about the possible online scams that could take place if they clicked on unverified links. Speaking to The Hindu, a senior official said the step was taken to warn youngsters who are likely to fall prey to such scams. \u201cEvery coveted event, taking into consideration their popularity, has attracted a large number of scamsters [in the past], who try to reap the benefit of people\u2019s enthusiasm,\u201d said the officer.

            "description": "The Rajya Sabha under Jagdeep Dhankar\u2019s chairmanship is leading by example in translating the ideal of women-led development into a reality",
            "content": "T he phrase \u2018women-led development\u2019, which was recognised as one of the six focal points during India\u2019s presidency of the G20, has always been a cornerstone of the government\u2019s priorities and policies. Under a women-led development approach, women are not just beneficiaries of development, but also set the agenda for development. They are key participants in planning and decision-making. Explained: On political representation of women Measures in the House At a time when women are leading governance and development initiatives across the world, India\u2019s legislature, a pivotal organ of its democracy, cannot afford to be left behind. It is in this backdrop that the Vice President of India and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Jagdeep Dhankar, has introduced a slew of progressive measures in the proceedings of the House as well as in the Secretariat. Mr. Dhankar has always held the view that the role of women in Parliament is enormous. He has stated that women are the backbone of Parliament and the country\u2019s economic development. When the nation witnessed the historic passage of the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam (Women\u2019s Reservation Bill), 2023, Mr. Dhankar, in a historic move, reconstituted the panel of vice-chairpersons to include only women. He emphasised that this would \u201csend a powerful message to the world at large and it would symbolise that they held a \u2018commanding position\u2019 during this epochal moment of change\u201d. Mr. Dhankar also began the practice of nominating four women members, who constitute 50% of the panel of vice-chairpersons. As a result, S. Phangnon Konyak became the first woman Rajya Sabha member from Nagaland to preside over the House. Eminent athlete P.T. Usha also created history by becoming the first nominated MP in history to become the Vice Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha. Under India\u2019s presidency, the G20 New Delhi Leaders\u2019 Declaration underscored that investing in the empowerment of all women and girls has a multiplier effect in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. India is already working tirelessly towards goal 5.5 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which calls for \u201cwomen\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic, and public life.\u201d The Rajya Sabha Secretariat is expected to set the highest standards in this direction. Also Read: Women Ministers increase their presence in the Houses, but remain stagnant in Union Ministry Initiatives in the Secretariat With the aim of striking a gender balance at the Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Mr. Dhankar has started many new initiatives. For example, the sections related to House duty were conventionally considered a male domain because they involved late sittings. The Chairman felt the need to break such stereotypes and so, all the gazetted women officers of the Secretariat were trained to perform House-related duties. Today, the Table of the House is largely being \u2018womanned\u2019 by female officers. Accordingly, a duty roster is prepared and women officers are deputed on chamber duty. Moreover, an application-based system called \u2018Vahan\u2019 was introduced to address the problem of commutation during late sitting hours. Through this app, women officers can avail themselves of commutation facilities during odd hours. In addition, through a process of selection, some women officials of the Secretariat have been appointed as chamber attendants. This has created a favourable atmosphere even inside the House for women MPs. During various interactions with the officers of the Secretariat, Mr. Dhankar has unequivocally stated that women-led development is going to be the future road map of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat. The process has already begun. Women officers have been appointed in key positions and leading roles in the Rajya Sabha Secretariat. Today, responsibilities such as human resources, the legislative section, and the capacity-building division have been entrusted to women officers of the Secretariat. Besides, high skill-based work such as officiating in Parliamentary Standing Committees of the Rajya Sabha is being done by women at various levels. Even some senior positions in security service are being occupied by women officers. Top performing women officers are being recognised and rewarded all across the services. A woman officer of the Secretariat has been appointed as master trainer for iGOT-Karmayogi Bharat. The noteworthy aspect about introducing women-centric measures in the Secretariat is the spirit of congeniality. Gender sensitisation workshops and talks have been organised to create a healthy culture of gender parity. The Chairman, from time to time, has also impressed upon the need of synergising work with creativity and recreation. The celebration of women\u2019s day in the Secretariat is a case in point. Women\u2019s day programmes are conceptualised, organised and executed by women officers or employees. These events give them many opportunities to showcase their talents. In a vibrant democracy, it is healthy to have regular interactions between the legislature and academia. The buck should not just stop at the Secretariat. Therefore, Mr. Dhankar offered to invite five interns from Miranda House in Delhi for a 15-day course on parliamentary procedures. The Rajya Sabha under Mr. Dhankar\u2019s chairmanship is leading by example in translating the ideal of women-led development into a reality. This may pave the way for other legislatures in India to follow suit. Kusum Sudhir, Joint Secretary (Interpretation) Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Parliament of India.

After the meeting, Mamata Banerjee addressed the media and said that the talks yielded positive results. She said that Goyal is also ready to resign from his post. During the meeting, doctors also demanded to remove the Director of Medical Education (DME), DHS and the Health Secretary. CM Mamata accepted the demand and removed DME, DHS from their posts. She said that she talked to everyone separately and she believes that the doctors should return to work. Notably, after many invitations by the government, the medics decided to meet CM Mamata today. The junior medics of RG Kar Hospital, who left work demanding justice for the Kolkata rape-murder case victim put conditions for the meeting. Their condition of noting minutes of the meeting was accepted by the Chief Secretary, following which, the doctors met CM Banerjee. The latest talk comes after four unsuccessful bids to initiate a dialogue to resolve the deadlock. The delegation of around 30 junior doctors was escorted by a pilot police vehicle to Banerjee's residence at 6.20 pm. The meeting, which was originally scheduled at 5 pm, began around 7 pm.",

            "content": "The Indian cricket team is gearing up for their first Test match against Bangladesh at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai from September 19 onwards. The Men in Blue will look to make the most of the two-match series against the Bangla Tigers, who themselves are coming off a series sweep over Pakistan recently. Ahead of the opening Test, the Indian players are training hard at Chepauk to get in the groove for the real action. The same happened in the third training session on Monday when all the 16 players - including Sarfaraz Khan, who joined the team after Duleep Trophy's second round - took part in an intense session. During the session, rising star Yashasvi Jaiswal was seen struggling big against the iconic pacer . The speedster cleaned up the Southpaw several times, sending his stumps flying for fun. As per reports, Jaiswal was struggling against India's senior pro and was not sure of his off-stump. Apart from Bumrah, he was troubled by the net bowlers Simarjeet Singh, Gurnoor Brar and Gurjanpreet Singh in the training session. Batting maestro , captain , and Sarfaraz Khan also batted. A fielding session also took place and India's fielding coach, T Dilip, opened up on it. \"Today, the whole session idea was to get everyone together for a team drill with two segments to it. First is competition taking humidity into account, we made sure that volume is less but intensity is more,\" Dilip told bcci.tv after the session. \"We split teams into two groups and made some competition in catching and the team that made less number of errors won. It was Virat's team that won today. We split two batches -- bowlers and all-rounders split into two stations, where outfield and in-field catching was taken care of along with attacking ground fielding. \"The second group was standard batting group for slip cordon catching and also short-leg, silly point with some reflex catching. Overall, I feel it was a fantastic session, considering hot overhead sun and getting used to it but one great part about this team is throughout all stations, the intensity was top notch in this weather,\" Dilip explained.",

            "content": "The CPI-affiliated AITUC has urged the government to urgently implement the long-pending plea for a welfare board for unorganised labourers. The AITUC general council, which held a meeting presided by Dinesh Ponnaiah, AITUC president, passed a resolution asking the government to not delay any further the establishment of a welfare board that would extend a social security net for more than 40,000 workers in the unorganised sector across diverse vocations. Pointing out that the government, which had announced the constitution of a welfare board following a long workers\u2019 struggle, the proposal was yet to take off. The government should immediately set up a welfare board and allocated adequate funds, the resolution said. Through another resolution, the AITUC reiterated its demand for a textile park that would aggregate defunct mills and generate jobs. It urged the Lt. Governor, K. Kailashnathan, who had recently visited the defunct AFT Mills and suggested putting the space to other use, to abandon the idea and instead take steps to revive the textile unit. The AITUC has also demanded that enterprises such as PASIC and PAPSCO immediately disburse salary arrears to workers. It also wanted the Pondicherry Municipality to conduct the election to the street vendors committee as the process had been postponed abruptly after the filing of nominations. AITUC general secretary K. Sethuselvam, AITUC honorary president V.S. Abishegam and others leaders participated.

A government source told The Hindu that Mr. Mohan was likely to reach Puducherry on Sunday evening. On the following day, he would hold a high level meeting to review progress of the Centre\u2019s flagship programmes and subjects pertaining to Union Territory administration. He is likely to leave Puducherry on Monday, the source said. Mr. Mohan took over as the Home Secretary in August. Prior to his appointment as Home Secretary, he was Secretary, Culture. Before moving to the Ministry of Culture, Mr. Mohan had a long stint in the Ministry of Home Affairs as Additional Secretary and Joint Secretary in-charge of the U.T. desk of the Ministry, said an official. \u201cHe is visiting U.T.s after taking charge as Home Secretary. Last week, he visited Andaman and reviewed implementation of schemes. Tentatively, the tour to Puducherry has been planned for Sunday and Monday. The schedule is yet to be fixed. As we come under the direct control of MHA, his visit will be of great significance,\u201d the source said. According to a ruling party member, the visit would be an occasion for the government to take up long pending administrative requirements. \u201cIn the recent times, we didn\u2019t have any visit by the Home Secretary to Puducherry to hold a review meeting. Since the officer is an old hand in the Ministry, he will be very aware of the issues and requirements of Puducherry. It is a good initiative on the part of Centre to depute the Home Secretary himself to assess the requirements of UT. We can discuss, sort out administrative issues and find ways to speed up implementation of infrastructure and welfare schemes,\u201d the member said.

Following the video going viral on social media, the police have now begun a probe. According to the police, the accused identified as Pawan Gowda alias Kadubu, is a rowdy sheeter at Rajagopal Nagar police station. The victim is his friend turned foe, who was assaulted reportedly over a trivial row, to teach him a lesson. The victim also has a criminal past and has hence not lodged a complaint, a senior police officer said. \u201cWe are on the lookout for both of them who are presently on the run \u201c the official added. The video was deliberately put on social media by the accused to create a fear psychosis among his rivals, as part of a well thought out strategy, the official said.

            "content": "The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) on Monday held a day-long fast to highlight the failure of the AINRC-BJP government to prevent frequent power tariff hike in Puducherry. Addressing the workers at the fast venue on Anna Salai, party secretary A. Anbalagan said the government cannot shrug its responsibility by merely stating that the power tariff was decided by the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC). The government did not put pressure on JERC to defer the hike, he said. The frequent hike has created huge financial burden on the common man, he said adding that the fast was only a token protest. The party would intensify its agitation if the hike was not withdrawn, he added. Participation of INDIA bloc constituents In a significant development, an Independent legislator, representatives of social organisations and Tamil outfits, who are usually associated with the INDIA bloc only in Puducherry, have participated in the protest. Extending support to the fast, Independent legislator, Nehru alias Kuppusamy, addressed the gathering and sat with the protestors for a few minutes. He said the recent hike was unwarranted and the subsidy announced by the government to offset the increase in tariff was insufficient. Representatives of social organisations and Tamil outfits also addressed the protesting workers.

            "content": "The Jipmer Resident Doctors\u2019 Association (JRDA) staged a pen-down protest confined to elective duties for an hour on Monday as part of a nation-wide stir to express solidarity with the month-long agitation by resident doctors in Kolkata seeking justice in the rape-murder of a PG trainee at the RG Kar Hospital. The JRDA rescheduled its pen-down stir planned initially during the forenoon to 4 p.m. following a request from the administration. They also took out a rally in the Jipmer campus from the OPD screening section to the Administration Block. Resident doctors also formed a human chain in a symbolic gesture of solidarity with the All India Resident and Junior Doctors\u2019 Joint Action Forum (AIJAF) that had called for a nation-wide protest in support of counterparts in Kolkata a day prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s next hearing on the rape-murder case. The core demands of the medicos\u2019 stir include expeditious justice in the Kolkata case and concrete measures to ensure workplace safety and security for healthcare professionals. Though the JRDA called off a ten-day boycott of elective services in August on the basis of \u201cpositive developments\u201d in the Supreme Court that had suo motu taken up the case, it had continued to hold silent protests, which have been backed by the Jipmer Faculty Association, as a means of sustaining pressure on authorites to address the key concerns of the medical fraternity while minimising impact on hospital services.

            "content": "The accused in the sensational case of rape and murder of a girl child in Puducherry has allegedly committed suicide inside the Central prison at Kalapet on Monday morning. According to police, the body of Harikrishnan alias Viveganandan, 56, was found in the toilet of the prison. Further investigation was on, police said. The case, which is at the trial stage now, had led to lot of political bickering and protests ahead of the recent Lok Sabha election in the Union Territory. What started off as a girl missing case on March 2, later turned out to be a heinous crime after police recovered the partially decomposed body of the child from a storm water drain next to the victim\u2019s house on March 5. Police arrested Viveganandan and his accomplice Kakka alias Karnas, 19, on the same day when the police recovered the victim\u2019s body. Both the accused were residing close to the house of the victim and knew the child and her family. Around 60 days after the incident occurred, the police had filed a 572-page chargesheet for prosecution of the accused under various charges including sections 376 AB (punishment for rape a woman under 12 years), 302 ( punishment for murder) of Indian Penal Code (now Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita), POCSO Act and sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. (Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State\u2019s health helpline 104, Tele-MANAS 14416, and Sneha\u2019s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050).

The video clip of the incident went viral on social media. Reacting to the social media post, several internet users compared it with the usual fights held in the Delhi Metro. It can be seen in the video that two groups are fighting with each other and threatening each other. The reason for the dispute is unclear, however, several media reports suggest that the argument began over keeping handbags in the cabin of the plane. The argument between the two families escalated to such an extent that other passengers and flight crew members had to intervene in the matter. Despite all efforts to pacify the fighting passengers, the spat did not stop and both started threatening each other. The other passengers can be heard advising them to speak politely. At the same time, the passenger travelling with his family threatened the other passenger that he would not be able to reach Delhi. Along with this, he also threatened the flight crew members by saying that no one would be able to go to Delhi. \"I will not let this flight fly,\" a passenger said while hurling harsh words at the co-passenger.",

            "content": "Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes on Monday (September 16, 2024) killed 16 people in the Gaza Strip, including five women and four children. A strike flattened a home in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 10 people there, including four women and two children. The Awda Hospital, which received the bodies, confirmed the toll and also said 13 people were wounded. Hospital records show that the dead included a mother, her child and her five siblings. Another strike on a home in Gaza City killed six people, including a woman and two children, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. Israel says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million. Here\u2019s the latest: JERUSALEM \u2013 The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says the first round of a polio vaccination campaign in Gaza ended successfully by reaching 90% of the children it targeted. UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on the social media platform X, that Israel and Palestinian militants had largely observed humanitarian pauses to allow the campaign to proceed. The vaccination drive showed that \u201cwhen there is a political will, assistance can be provided without disruption,\u201d Mr. Lazzarini wrote on Monday (September 16, 2024). UNRWA is the main provider of humanitarian assistance in the coastal enclave. Health workers plan to administer a second dose of the vaccine at the end of this month. The campaign was launched after the detection of Gaza\u2019s first polio case in 25 years and sought to reach some 640,000 children under the age of 10. Health workers faced a host of challenges, including damaged roads, gutted health facilities and ongoing fighting nearly a year into the Israel-Hamas war. JERUSALEM \u2013 Israel\u2019s defense minister has told his U.S. counterpart that time is running out for an agreement with Hezbollah to halt the fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. Yoav Gallant told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that \u201cthe possibility for an agreed framework in the northern arena is running out as Hezbollah continues to \u2018tie itself\u2019 to Hamas.\u201d \u201cThe trajectory is clear,\u201d Mr. Gallant added, according to a statement released from his office on Monday (September 16, 2024). Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones into northern Israel after the outbreak of the war in Gaza, which was ignited by Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack. Both armed groups are allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded to the attacks with airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders. It has threatened a wider operation, raising fears of another all-out war. Hezbollah has said it will halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but months of talks brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as part of any agreement to release the scores of hostages it still holds from the October 7 attack. Mr. Gallant told Mr. Austin that \u201cin any possible scenario, Israel\u2019s defence establishment will continue to operate with the aim of dismantling Hamas and ensuring the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza \u2013 by any means.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 11:47 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Watch: Is Israel winning the war in Gaza?

            "content": "175 individuals in Malappuram district have been identified on the contact list linked to the recent Nipah virus outbreak. Kerala\u2019s Health Minister, Veena George, has confirmed that 175 individuals in Malappuram district have been identified on the contact list linked to the recent Nipah virus outbreak. Among them, 74 are healthcare professionals, and 104 are considered high-risk due to their close proximity to the infected. Breakdown of Contacts and Medical Attention Of the 175 contacts, 126 people are listed under primary contact, with 49 classified as secondary contacts. Ten individuals are currently receiving treatment at Manjeri Medical College Hospital. The health minister added that samples from 13 people have been sent for testing, with results still pending. This outbreak follows the death of a 24-year-old man on September 9, marking the second fatality from the Nipah virus in Kerala this year. The state witnessed its first death due to the virus on July 21, 2024. Kerala has faced repeated Nipah outbreaks since 2018, which have heightened vigilance in the region. The virus, identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a priority pathogen, poses significant epidemic potential due to the absence of vaccines or specific treatment options. Containment Zones and Public Restrictions in Malappuram In response to the threat, the state has enforced stringent containment measures in five wards of Malappuram district. These areas have been declared containment zones, where all shops must close by 7 PM. Public spaces such as cinema halls, schools, colleges, Madrassas, anganwadis, and tuition centers will remain closed. Authorities have also restricted public gatherings. Events like weddings and funerals have a cap on the number of attendees. People are required to wear masks in public and avoid large gatherings to curb the virus's spread.",

            "content": "The Halasuru Gate police have registered a cheating and forgery case against a gang of six running a fake job racket for cheating several unemployed youth promising government jobs. Two of the victims, who have been working as a senior and junior assistant in Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) for two years on a contract basis realised that they have been cheated and complained to the police on Saturday. Based on their complaint, the police registered an FIR against Praveen M. Somankatti and Vignesh Hegade along with four others charging them for cheating, forgery and criminal intimidation. B. Lohith Gowda, the complainant in this case said that he met the accused in 2021 who claimed to be working in Bescom and Indian Railways. The accused claiming high-level contacts promised to get jobs in different departments. Following this, Lohith Gowda contacted his friends and relatives for government jobs and even paid several lakhs. The accused even asked two of the victims to join as senior and junior assistants in Bescom, M.G. road and Jalahalli division on a contract basis and even got the salary through executive engineer concerned account. The duo was asked to work on a contract basis for 18 months and promised to get them a permanent role later. After the deadline when the victims in March last year went to check for the update, they were sent back asking them to continue work for six more months. Even after several deadlines passed when the accused started giving evasive responses, the victim realized that they had been cheated and filed a complaint. Initial probe revealed that the accused were not the employees of Bescom or Indian Railways as they had claimed and that they were cheating gullible youth with fake letter heads and ID cards. The accused are said to have cheated many people. There is a similar case pending against them in High Grounds Police Station, probe has now revealed.

Kombans, playing in front of a boisterous crowd, cashed on to the chances through set pieces to score full points in the scrappy encounter. T.M. Vishnu (15) and Lalhmangaihsanga (69) were the goal-scorers for the host. There was no magic from Thrissur in the first half as Kombans enjoyed more possession and made more forays into the rival box. Kombans earned three corners in the first quarter and the opening goal came off the third. The ball was whipped in by captain Patrick Mota and T.M. Vishnu rushed in and headed it past \u2019keeper Sanjiban Ghosh\u2019s near post. Thrissur had its first look at the rival goal in the 22nd minute when it earned a freekick at the edge of the Kombans box. Marcelo Toscano\u2019s kick rebounded off the wall and the striker retrieved the loose ball and passed it to Vineeth who shot out from close. Thrissur showed more cohesion towards the end of the first half and had a chance to equalise. Vineeth arrowed in a cross from the left but Abhijith Sarkar failed to connect. The visitor off its timidity in the second half and the side strung a few threatening moves down the flanks but Kombans defence kept their shape. Kombans increased the lead against the run of play. The goal came through another freekick which was whipped in by Mota, Marcos Santos flicked it on to an unmarked Lalhmangaishsanga, who made no mistake. The result: Thiruvananthapuram Kombans 2 (Vishnu 15, Lalhmangaihsanga 69) bt Thrissur Magic FC 0.

            "description": "After a slash in the export duty on onions, the delay in updating the Customs Department\u2019s software is costing traders and farmers dearly",
            "content": "Three days after the Union government slashed the export duty on onions from 40% to 20%, onions worth lakhs of rupees are stuck at India\u2019s borders and ports, awaiting an update for the system, as a result of which farmers and traders have not yet been able to benefit from the export duty slash. Around 380 containers are stuck at various ports of the country, including the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (JNPA) in Navi Mumbai, while 90 lorries wait at two checkpoints on the border with Bangladesh, an official of the Horticulture Produce Exporters\u2019 Association (HPEA) said. Each container carries about 30 tonnes of cargo, and each lorry carries about 25 to 30 tonnes. \u201cThere is a technical issue in the Customs\u2019 portal. There are two serial numbers on the portal for onions. But the portal does not process the order. We are unable to avail the 20% export duty. We can\u2019t even send the onions with 40% customs duty. Our onions have been stuck for the last three days. Now we fear they will start rotting,\u201d Vikas Singh, vice president, HPEA told The Hindu . \u201cOur containers are stuck everywhere. Tomorrow (Wednesday) morning, almost 60 containers are planned to be sent to Malaysia and Singapore. The vessel has been booked. But if the containers are not cleared in the system, the vessel will leave [without] these containers,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost 300 containers are stuck at the JNPA since Friday evening. Nothing could be loaded due to lack of clearance. Fifty containers await clearance at the dry port of Janori in Nasik; 60 lorries have been waiting at Goja Danga check point on the Bangladesh border; and 30 lorries are at Mehndipur check point, also on the Bangladesh border,\u201d Mr. Singh said. He added that if the issue was not resolved within a few hours, 35 containers that were slated to reach Tuticorin port in Tamil Nadu early on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) morning, would also be delayed. \u201cTuticorin is the sub-port for Sri Lanka. The vessel, which has already been booked, will arrive on Wednesday. So those 35 containers will need to be cleared on Tuesday,\u201d Mr. Singh said. The HPEA is the only recognised association for exporters of onion, garlic, and horticulture, Mr. Singh said. \u201cWe have updated this [issue] to the Consumer Affairs Ministry, and to the Agriculture Ministry,\u201d he added. An onion trader who did not wish to be named rued the restrictions. \u201cWhen the government imposes restrictions, the implementation is immediate. But while opening the system, why is there so much of delay? Each container is worth approximately \u20b921 lakh. Today (Monday) is the third day and we are still suffering. On one hand, China is becoming very aggressive with respect to onions. And here, we face so many restrictions,\u201d he said. Sources in the Customs Department said there was a \u201csystem issue\u201d that was being resolved. \u201cEverything is being monitored. The communication has been sent to the concerned persons.

            "content": "Kejriwal's decision to resign comes after his release from Tihar jail on Friday, following his arrest in the excise policy case. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is expected to step down from his position on Tuesday. The AAP has scheduled a legislative party meeting at 11 a.m. to discuss and select his successor. The name of the new chief minister is likely to be announced at the same time. Kejriwal's decision to resign comes after his release from Tihar jail on Friday, following his arrest in the excise policy case. On Sunday, he declared that he would resign as the chief minister within two days, adding that he would not return to the position unless the people of Delhi grant him a \"certificate of honesty.\" The AAP leader plans to meet Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday to formally submit his resignation. Simultaneously, the new CM will stake their claim to the position. Legislative Party Meeting to Decide Successor Ahead of the legislative party meeting, Kejriwal held a series of one-on-one discussions with senior AAP leaders during the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) meeting on Monday. According to AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj, Kejriwal sought feedback from party leaders regarding his potential successor. Names being considered for the role include prominent AAP leaders such as Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj, Kailash Gahlot, Gopal Rai, and Imran Hussain. There is also speculation that Kejriwal's wife, Sunita Kejriwal, could be a potential candidate for the post. However, Kejriwal has ruled out former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia as a successor. Possibility of a Dalit Leader as Next CM Some AAP members have suggested the appointment of a Dalit leader as the next chief minister. Although no specific names have been confirmed, this possibility reflects the party's broader agenda of inclusivity. The new CM will hold office until the next elections are conducted. Kejriwal's Call for Early Elections During his resignation announcement, Kejriwal expressed his desire for early elections in Delhi, ideally in November 2024, ahead of the current schedule of February 2025. He emphasized that he would only return to the CM position after successfully proving his honesty to the public. \"I will sit on the CM's chair only after people give me a certificate of honesty. I will become chief minister and Manish Sisodia deputy CM only when people say we are honest,\" he declared.",

            "content": "Maharashtra has 288 legislative assembly seats and the state will go to the polls in October-November this year. NAGPUR: Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Monday said the constituents of the Mahayuti alliance- Shiv Sena, BJP, and NCP- have arrived at a consensus on contesting 70 to 80 per cent of 288 seats for the assembly elections. He hinted winnability will be the criterion for distributing poll tickets. \"The three leaders of Mahayuti (Eknath Shinde, Devendra Fadnavis, and Ajit Pwar) should be congratulated for vowing to win elections unitedly instead of quoting numbers. We will agree upon fielding winnable candidates,\" the BJP leader told reporters in Nagpur. He was replying to a query on NCP, headed by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, purportedly staking claim to 70 to 80 seats. A consensus has been reached on 70 to 80 per cent of seats and Mahayuti leaders will soon address a joint press conference, he said. Bawankule asked Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange to respond to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remarks on \"removing\" reservation. \"Rahul Gandhi is trying to remove the present reservations; what will happen to the Maratha quota? Jarange should respond to Rahul Gandhi's remarks,\" Bawankule told reporters. The BJP has accused the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha of making \"anti-reservation\" remarks during his visit to the US.",

A 38-year-old Muslim man has been arrested here for allegedly deceiving a Dalit Hindu woman into marriage under a false identity and then raping her, police said on Monday. Accused Danish, who went by the alibi of Dev, has been arrested by the Sahibabad police station officials here, a senior officer said. \"The woman initially met 'Dev' about a year-and-a-half ago while applying for a driving licence. According to her complaint, in April of the previous year, 'Dev' persuaded her to wear a 'mangalsutra' and establish a physical relationship during a visit to a Sahibabad hotel,\" Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Sahibabad Rajneesh Upadhyay said. \"They subsequently lived together in a rented accommodation in Dasna, where she became pregnant. Danish secretly administered an abortion pill, and it was only after the pregnancy was terminated that she learned of his true identity,\" Upadhyay added. Upon discovering the truth, the victim confronted Danish at his home in July this year, where she was allegedly assaulted by his family members, he said. Following this, a Zero FIR was filed at Kapurpur police station in Hapur district and later transferred to Sahibabad police station. A formal case was registered on September 12. Upadhyay said the presence of both the victim and Danish at a Sahibabad hotel was verified through evidence. Danish has been charged under BNS sections 115(2)/123(2)/318(4), 64, and 3(2)5 of the SC/ST Act and has been sent to jail, the officer added.",

            "content": "The Madhya Pradesh government and the State police came under criticism from the Opposition Congress on Monday (September 16, 2024) after a video of a police officer tearing off his clothes during an argument with the husband of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillor inside a police station went viral. The leaked CCTV footage from the chamber of the station in-charge at Baidhan police station in Singrauli district shows officers and others trying to broker peace between assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Vinod Mishra and BJP leader Arjun Gupta, the husband of councillor Gauri Gupta. They were arguing over the construction of a drain near Mr. Mishra\u2019s house. According to the police, the incident happened in February, and disciplinary action has been taken against Mr. Mishra. Singrauli Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Shiv Kumar Verma told The Hindu that an inquiry into the matter was ordered by SP Nivedita Gupta and action was taken against Mr. Mishra. \u201cThe SP had taken action and halted the ASI\u2019s annual increment for his in actions,\u201d Mr. Verma said. An officer from the Baidhan police station said an argument had broken out between the BJP leader and the ASI. \u201cThe councillor\u2019s husband had said something about getting Mr. Mishra\u2019s uniform taken off which, I think, agitated him,\u201d the officer said. In the video, Mr. Mishra suddenly begins tearing off his shirt and throwing it away. He is also seen yelling even as other officers try to pacify him and Mr. Gupta. The officer further goes on to throw his cap and belt. When asked if any action was taken against Mr. Gupta, the ASP said, \u201cI am not aware if the ASI submitted any complaint. That is a different issue, and we will look into it.\u201d Ms. Gupta, in a statement, said she had ordered a probe when the matter was brought to her attention about four to five months ago, and that there was a land dispute between the two parties. Slamming the police officer\u2019s behaviour, Ms. Gupta said she took action against the ASI based on the facts of the investigation and also suspended then station in-charge. \u201cIn the probe conducted by a Deputy SP-level officer, an old dispute over some land and drain had come up. The ASI\u2019s health problems had also appeared as his blood pressure had increased that time. But I took action as he disrespected the uniform no matter whatever pressure he was under,\u201d the SP said. A separate inquiry is currently underway to ascertain who leaked the video, she said. The Opposition Congress hit out at the government over the issue. Sharing the video on X, the State Congress said that the threats of a BJP leader forced a police officer to tear off his uniform. \u201cThe level of policing in the State has reached zero! Crime is out of control, criminals are fearless, and the police are helpless at some places and under pressure at others,\u201d the post read. \u201cThis means both the condition and direction of the Home Department have deteriorated under Chief Minister Mohan Yadav! How will the public get justice, when the police itself has to tear its uniform!\u201d the Congress said. The party has long demanded that Mr. Yadav gave up the charge of the Home Department alleging that the Chief Minister has not been able to maintain law and order in the State. Multiple cases of rape from Indore and Ujjain, violence against Dalits and tribals, handling of communal situations and police brutality in recent months have given the Opposition ammunition to target the BJP.

            "content": "Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh remained tense on Monday after multiple Hindu outfits protested in the city over allegations of stone throwing at a local temple during an Eid Milad-un-Nabi procession, and demanded police action in the matter. Police said the alleged incident took place in the afternoon when members of the Muslim community were taking out an Eid procession. Hindu groups alleged that some stones were thrown from the procession at a local temple and an assistant of the temple priest was injured. The alleged incident comes just a week after the neighbouring Ratlam district was on the boil over allegations of stone throwing at a procession taken out to install a Lord Ganesh idol and the alleged death of a person in police lathicharge on protesting Hindu outfits on September 7. A magisterial probe is under way in this connection. Mandsaur Superintendent of Police (SP) Abhishek Anand told The Hindu that the temple priest had given a complaint that 10-15 unidentified men attacked the temple and hurled stones at it. \u201cBased on his complaint and the medical examination of the injured person, we have registered a case on charges of stone throwing and assault,\u201d Mr. Anand said, adding that the police were now scanning CCTV footage from the area around temple. The SP said that after the alleged incident, members of the Hindu outfits arrived at the temple to protest, demanding that the Eid procession be ended quickly. \u201cThe police beefed up security and the procession was taken out on the approved route and ended in time peacefully,\u201d he said. Speaking to reporters, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Ratlam Range, Manoj Kumar Singh, said, \u201cDuring a procession, attempts were made by a particular community to create unrest in the city, and there were some violent actions taken by them.\u201d Mr. Singh said that the situation was brought under control by the police who are now working to identify the accused. \u201cEverything is peaceful now and the upcoming festivals will be celebrated properly,\u201d he said. Mr. Anand also said that a meeting of representatives of various communities and citizen groups was held in the evening and an appeal to maintain peace was made. The SP, in a video message, also asked people to avoid believing and sharing misinformation and report it to the police. Police force and officers from 8-10 neighbouring police stations had been brought in, and 80 personnel of the reserved force had also been deployed in the city, he said.

            "content": "Super sub Alaeddine Ajaraie found the target in injury-time as NorthEast United FC prevailed over debutant Mohammedan SC by a solitary goal in their ISL match at the Kishore Bharati Stadium here on Monday. Mohammedan, which defended well and also created a few opportunities, saw its maiden league contest end in a heartbreak as Ajaraie struck late. The opening period was a battle between the Mohammedan defence and NorthEast attack. The visitors had an early chance but could not cause any damage as striker Guillermo Fernandez\u2019s left-footer went wide. Mohammedan lacked sharpness in the transition stage and looked hesitant in the attacking third. It was NEUFC which came close to scoring in the 36th minute but the opportunity went abegging as midfielder M.S. Jithin was off-target. The change of ends did not alter things as Mohammedan continued to be defensive. The few incursions it managed did not work well. NEUFC was determined to prove that its Durand Cup triumph was no flash in the pan, but was kept at bay by a resolute home defence till the fourth minute of extra-time. However, the match turned on its head when Ajaraie fired home a Thoi Singh assist to secure full points for the Highlanders. The result: Mohammedan SC 0 lost to NorthEast United FC 1 (Ajaraie 90+4). Tuesday\u2019s match: FC Goa vs. Jamshedpur FC. Published - September 16, 2024 11:12 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "Bangladesh has had a tough last few months, dealing with internal political turmoil followed by floods that affected the daily lives of scores of its citizens. Even as things were on the boil at home, the cricket team pulled off a stunning upset away in Pakistan, sweeping the two-Test series 2-0 recently, bringing some succour to the embattled nation. Fresh from the historic series win, Najmul Hossain Shanto\u2019s men embark on their next big challenge, searching for their first Test victory against India. The two-match series, though, will be a much more daunting task. It will be a true test of how far the outfit has come in the longest format, for India has lost just four Tests in its backyard in the last decade. The visitors have a balanced squad to give India a run for its money as compared to their visit four years ago. Key batters like Mushfiqur Rahim, Litton Das and all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz starred in the triumph over Pakistan. Litton and Miraz\u2019s tenacity \u2014 they rescued the side from 26 for six with a 165-run stand in the second Test \u2014 should give the squad confidence. On the bowling front, Bangladesh will feel it has the right mix of pace and spin to counter Rohit Sharma\u2019s men on any type of surface. In the second Test against Pakistan, the pace trio of Taskin Ahmed, Nahid Rana and Hasan Mahmud took all 10 wickets in the second essay while off-spinner Miraz finished with a series-high 10 scalps. Prior to its journey to India, the team had a camp in Mirpur. The Tigers slogged out in the hot sun for over three hours during their first practice session at the MAC Stadium on Monday. Skipper Shanto and opener Zakir Hasan were among the first to have long batting sessions against pace and spin. All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who was playing for Surrey, is expected to join the squad on Tuesday. In the morning, India had its third training session in four days. With the match expected to be played on a red-soil pitch, the home team trained on a track of similar nature which offered good bounce and carry for the pacers. The batters fine-tuned their sweeps and reverse sweeps. While Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and K.L. Rahul looked in fine touch, opener Yashasvi Jaiswal played and missed while facing the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep. In 2019, India had laid out seamer-friendly strips in Indore and Kolkata (day-night Test), where the quicks took 33 out of the 40 wickets and the host recorded innings wins. That strategy could be employed again. Published - September 16, 2024 11:10 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Haryana Election 2024: With a few weeks left for Haryana assembly elections, the BJP and the Congress are working hard to woo the voters. While the BJP has accused the Congress of factionalism within the party with multiple CM candidates, the same problem is now hurting the saffron party. In Haryana, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini's position is being eyed by his colleagues. After the scramble for tickets in the Haryana BJP, there's now a race to become the Chief Minister. After Union Minister of State Rao Inderjit Singh, now Haryana BJP's prominent leader Anil Vij has staked his claim for the Chief Minister's chair, creating challenges for the BJP leadership right before the elections. In today's DNA, Zee News decoded the challenge that the BJP is facing in Haryana: \u0917\u0923\u092a\u0924\u093f \u092c\u092a\u094d\u092a\u093e \u0915\u094b \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0928\u0947 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u092f\u093e '\u092c\u092a\u094d\u092a\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0908\u091c\u093e\u0928'?

I have been an MLA for six terms and am the most senior here. But today, I am asking \u2014 I am staking my claim for the Chief Minister's position...The people of Ambala have continuously demanded this. Whether or not the leadership appoints me, but if I become the Chief Minister, I will change the fate and face of Haryana,\" said Vij, staking claim to the CM post. Anil Vij, the former Home Minister of Haryana, who wasn't given a place in Nayab Saini's cabinet by the BJP leadership, is now directly staking his claim for the Chief Minister's post. Anil Vij is not the first one to express his desire to become the Chief Minister. Before him, Union Minister Rao Inderjit Singh had also staked his claim for the Chief Minister's position. \"The people here want me to become the CM. If the people here hadn't supported BJP, Manohar Lal Khattar wouldn't have become the Chief Minister of Haryana twice,\" said Rao Inderjit Singh on September 9. The race for the Chief Minister's position within Haryana BJP continues even though three months ago, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had made it clear that the BJP would contest the elections with Nayab Singh Saini as its face for the Chief Minister's position.",

            "content": "The Ministry of External Affairs on Monday rebuked Tehran over the recent remarks made by Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei regarding Muslims in India. In dia issued a statement condemning the remarks and said, \"We strongly deplore the comments made regarding minorities in India by the Supreme Leader of Iran. These are misinformed and unacceptable.\" In its statement, the MEA also advised countries making statements on minorities in India to look at their record. The statement read, \"Countries commenting on minorities are advised to look at their own record before making any observations about others.\" India's statement came hours after Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei said that one can not consider oneself a Muslim if they are oblivious to the sufferings of Muslims in Myanmar, Gaza and India. In a post on X, Khamenei said, \"The attempt of the enemies of Islam has been to make us indifferent to the unique identity called \"Islamic Ummah\", one cannot consider oneself a Muslim and at the same time be oblivious to the sufferings that a Muslim goes through at Myanmar, at Gaza, in India or elsewhere.\" Khamenei gave the statement while he faced backlash at home for curbing women's rights and imposing a burqa and hijab. Earlier in the day, thousands of women hit the street in Tehran marking the second death anniversary of Mahasa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after she was arrested by Iran's morality police for not wearing hijab. Amini's death sparked a series of protests. Eventually, she became the symbol of resistance for women's rights activists.",

            "content": "Medium-pacer Anshul Kamboj (23) was both surprised and hopeful when he was named in the India-C squad for the Duleep Trophy. \u201cI was not hoping for that (Duleep Trophy call-up), because I\u2019ve done well in white-ball cricket. Red ball was not good for me last year. But (after selection) I was hoping that maybe I will come in (into the XI) and play. I got my chances and I have done well,\u201d he said, after his team\u2019s second-round match against India-B at the Rural Development Trust (RDT) Stadium B-ground here on Sunday. It was his eight for 69, his maiden First Class five-for, that helped India-C secure a big first-innings lead. He was adjudged the Player-of-the-Match. What made this bowling effort even more special was that it came on a batting wicket, after the team lost its pace spearhead Sandeep Warrier to a hamstring injury. Kamboj and Vijaykumar Vyshak had to bear the extra workload in Warrier\u2019s absence. He had come into the tournament having played just 13 First Class matches. \u201cActually, not much was happening for the bowlers on this wicket. So, I bowled in front of them (the batters), so that I had the chance to get lbw and bowled dismissals,\u201d he said. Asked if there is one dismissal that he was happy about, he said: \u201cSaifu bhaiyya (Sarfaraz Khan). He is one of the best, has scored a lot of runs in the domestic circuit.\u201d India-B skipper and opener Abhimanyu Easwaran, who carried his bat with an unbeaten 157 (286b, 14x4, 1x6), felt good about having been able to bat for a long time since he came into the tournament after recovering from a hamstring injury. \u201cI was at the NCA for about two and a half months, and then I went to my Bengal team\u2019s camp. There, I batted and basically the preparation was just getting into match zone. I also played a practice match. \u201cTo be able to bat for a long period after my injury was good. I really enjoyed spending time in the middle, and I think it\u2019ll give me confidence for the next game as well,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a veiled attack on the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, on Monday said, \u201cCertain individuals filled with hate and negativity are undermining the country\u2019s unity and integrity besides maligning its image.\u201d The Prime Minister was addressing a gathering in his home state Gujarat, where he launched various development projects, inaugurated the new metro line between the twin cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar and a new train between Kutch and Ahmedabad. In his first visit to Gujarat after the Lok Sabha polls, he laid the foundation to various projects and inaugurated many, all worth \u20b98,000 crore. He also flagged off the Bhuj-Ahmedabad Namo Bharat Rapid Rail, the first Vande Bharat Metro service, and five Vande Bharat express trains. He interacted with the beneficiaries of a rooftop solar power scheme. \u201cSome people filled with negativity are targeting India\u2019s unity and integrity with the intention to divide the country. Those filled with hate are not leaving any chance to malign or defame India and Gujarat,\u201d he told the audience that had gathered at the sprawling ground of GMDC in western Ahmedabad. The crowd was brought in by several thousand state transport buses and local transport services. Talking about his Lok Sabha \u201celection victory\u201d, the Prime Minister said he was mocked and jeered by the opposition but he did not heed them. Instead, Mr. Modi said, he focused on working for the welfare of the people of the country. \u2018Positive interest in India\u2019 He said that the world was looking at India with a positive interest in all spheres. \u201cWhen the trust in India increases, our exports increase and more investment comes into the country. When the trust in India increases, foreign investors make investments in India. They invest in factories and businesses. On one hand, every citizen of the country wants to become India\u2019s brand ambassador for the whole world and is engaged in taking his country forward.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, in the same country, some people full of negativity are doing the opposite. These people are attacking the unity of the country. These greedy people hungry for power want to break India into pieces,\u201d he said in an apparent reference to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\u2019s recent speeches during his US visit. Hitting out at the opposition for talking about restoring Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Prime Minister asked if they wanted two constitutions in J&K.

Addressing the media here on Monday, she said that there was a need for early identification programmes as children with specific learning disability appear normal otherwise and with average/ below average IQ but without age-appropriate academic skills, showing a deficit of two years or more. \u201cThey will require appropriate intervention,\u201d she added. The school is celebrating their silver jubilee year and hosting a conference \u2018Learn 2024\u2019 on inclusion and empowerment of neuro-diverse children. Speaking about their two schools \u2013 Sankalp The Open School and Sankalp The learning Centre and Special Needs School \u2013 principal of the Learning Centre and Special Needs School Evelyn John said, \u201cThe school offers Class 10 and 12 academic stream training accredited through National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) along with vocational courses, such as data entry, sewing, weaving among others, which offer the individuals a chance at independency.\u201d Pointing out that there is a dearth of special educators in the field, especially those in specific learning disability, Ms. Ajith said, \u201cSankalp now offers a Diploma in Special Education (intellectual and developmental disabilities), a two-year programme. In our schools, we strictly follow the teacher-student ratio of 1:8 set by the Union government. However, it is becoming difficult to recruit qualified special educators as there is a shortage of such teachers graduating.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 10:49 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

If you see the promises that were made in first 100 days by the Prime Minister or the NDA government, none of them have been fulfilled. Today, the country needs a new leadership, a new government, and the INDIA alliance will come with a new government very soon. Count how many times in these 100 days, the PM was abroad,\" he said. The NDA government, which assumed office on June 9, has nothing to show in terms of achievements, the former state minister insisted. \"This is basically a statement of these 100 days.

            "description": "Why has Tamil Nadu not received its Samagra Shiksha funds for this year? What are the conditions attached to the release of Tamil Nadu\u2019s education funds? How does the National Education Policy 2020 affect funding? Why is the three-language formula a contentious issue?",
            "content": "The story so far: Tamil Nadu is yet to receive this year\u2019s funds from the Union government under the flagship education scheme Samagra Shiksha. According to the State government, the Centre has linked these funds to the complete implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which includes provisions that the State has opposed, including the contentious three-language formula. The impasse has come to a head over the last two weeks, with a public war of words between the Centre and State erupting on X. What is Samagra Shiksha and why has Tamil Nadu not gotten funds under it? Samagra Shiksha is an integrated Centrally-sponsored scheme for school education from nursery till Class 12, with components for teacher training and salaries, special education, digital education, school infrastructure, administrative reform, vocational and sports education, with grants for textbooks, uniforms, and libraries, among others. The scheme\u2019s estimated outlay between 2021 and 2026 is \u20b92.94 lakh crore, with the Centre and States contributing funds in a 60:40 ratio. For 2024-25, Tamil Nadu\u2019s allocation under the scheme amounts to \u20b93,586 crore of which the Central share is \u20b92,152 crore, with a first quarterly instalment of \u20b9573 crore, which has not yet arrived halfway through the financial year. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin accused the Centre of imposing a prerequisite for the fund\u2019s disbursal, namely, the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for another Centrally-sponsored education scheme called PM Schools for Rising India (PM Shri). This scheme, being run from 2022-2027, aims to create 14,500 model schools across the country to showcase the implementation of NEP 2020, and has a much smaller project cost of \u20b927,360 crore. The Centre has sent at least 10 letters to Tamil Nadu from September 2022, asking the State to sign the MoU, which included an agreement to fully implement the NEP. In March 2024, the State gave an undertaking that it would do so, with Tamil Nadu Education Minister Anbil Mahesh saying that this was because the PM Shri MoU was being linked to funding for the much larger Samagra Shiksha \u2014 the delayed third and fourth instalments from 2023-24, and the full funds for the current year. In July, the State signed a modified MoU, dropping the paragraph on NEP implementation, however, this was unacceptable to the Centre. In his August letter, Mr. Stalin noted that States which had signed the MoU had received the funds, and in a September post on X, accused the Centre of \u201cdenying funds to the best-performing States for refusing to bow to the NEP\u201d. The Union Education department has taken umbrage at this implication. In response to an article by The Hindu , a Ministry spokesperson said it was \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cincorrect\u201d to suggest any such \u201c quid pro quo \u201d. However, the fact remains that Tamil Nadu has not signed the complete PM Shri MoU and has not received Samagra Shiksha funds. What is Tamil Nadu\u2019s problem with the NEP 2020? In a post on X, Mr. Mahesh said the State\u2019s objections \u201crelate to specific elements like the three-language formula and curriculum changes\u201d, and noted that \u201cTamil Nadu is already implementing many acceptable aspects of NEP through its own initiatives\u201d. He also warned that linking the release of Samagra Shiksha funds to full NEP compliance \u201cinfringes upon the State\u2019s constitutional autonomy in education\u201d. Tamil Nadu\u2019s draft State Education Policy (SEP), submitted in July, clearly indicates that the State wants to stick to the 5+3+2+2 curricular formula, rather than the NEP, which includes the pre-school years. The SEP also proposes five years as the age of entry to Class 1, as against six years in the NEP. The State wants undergraduate college admissions to be based on Class 11 and 12 marks, rather than a common entrance test as proposed by the NEP. The biggest hurdle, however, is the NEP\u2019s three-language formula. Why does Tamil Nadu oppose the three-language formula? The NEP 2020 recommends the mother tongue or the local language as the medium of instruction till Class 5 and says that all school students should be taught at least three languages, of which two must be native to India. This three-language formula recommendation has been in every NEP since 1968, and has been implemented in many States by teaching the local language, as well as English and Hindi, with Sanskrit also offered as an option, especially in Hindi-speaking States. Tamil Nadu has had a long-standing opposition to this formula, dating back to social movements in the pre-Independence era. From a widespread agitation against mandatory Hindi in the 1930s to violent anti-Hindi riots in the late 1960s, to protests against the NEP and Navodaya schools in 1986, there has been a consistent political consensus on the issue. Instead, the State implements a two-language formula, making it mandatory for all students to study both Tamil and English throughout their school years, and they are free to choose Hindi or any other language as an optional third. \u201cWe embrace Tamil as a pillar of our identity while also ensuring future generations are equipped with English proficiency,\u201d Mr. Mahesh said in a recent post on X. NEP 2020 says that \u201cthere will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any State\u201d, indicating that it is not mandatory to include Hindi as one of the three languages. However, this would still allow students to choose Tamil as a third language, to be studied for just a few years in middle school. All major political parties in Tamil Nadu have rejected this formula on principle. When Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked whether this \u201cprincipled\u201d stance against NEP meant that Tamil Nadu was opposing education in the mother tongue including Tamil, Mr. Mahesh responded that the State\u2019s policy has \u201calways prioritised inclusive learning with Tamil as a cornerstone, while empowering students with knowledge in English\u201d.

            "content": "Campaigning for the first phase of the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly elections , in which the stakes are high for the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the National Conference, ended on Monday. Besides the traditional rivals, the electoral battle features the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress, the CPI(M), Independents backed by the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and Member of Parliament Sheikh Abdul Rashid, also known as Engineer Rashid, who is out on bail. Around 23.27 lakh voters, including 5.66 lakh youths, will decide the fate of leaders such as Iltija Mufti, 37, daughter of PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, who is contesting from Srigufwara-Bijbehara. All the 16 segments of south Kashmir\u2019s Anantnag, Pulwama, Shopian and Kugam, which the PDP claims as its bastion, will go to the polls in the first phase. In 2014, the party had won 11 seats from south Kashmir. \u201cBijbehara is not just a home to the Muftis but is our bastion. It will always remain so. I pledge to serve people not as a politician but as a daughter and a sister,\u201d Ms. Mufti said, as she wrapped up her first-ever campaign as a candidate. She is pitted against the NC\u2019s Dr. Bashir Ahmad Veeri, who too has campaigned with vigour attracting sizeable crowds in his rallies. Ms. Mufti sought votes on the resolution of the Kashmir issue, the release of arrested youth, ending the security crackdown and guaranteeing the rights and dignity of the people, besides restoration of Article 370. The PDP\u2019s Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra, who spent 19 months in jail on charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is contesting from the Pulwama constituency. He is up against 11 candidates, including the NC\u2019s Mohammad Khalil Bandh, a former PDP leader. Talat Majid Alie, who holds a PhD in Agriculture, is backed by the JeI. It is for the first time that the banned outfit is supporting Independent candidates in an election. The CPI(M)\u2018s M.Y. Tarigami is up against JeI-backed candidate Sayar Ahmad Reshi in Kulgam, which is set to see a neck-to-neck fight. The NC-Congress combine is looking at these elections as their potential chance to revive and expand in south Kashmir in the wake of several senior leaders leaving the PDP in the past five years and ahead of the elections. NC leader and former Member of Parliament Hasnain Massodi is contesting from Pampore and former Minister Sakeena Masood from D.H. Pora. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Ahmad Mir is fighting the election from Dooru and is pitted against the PDP\u2019s Mohammad Ashraf Malik. In Anantnag-44, the Congress\u2019 Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed will see a close fight from the PDP\u2019s Mehbooba Beg, also a former MP. Senior Congress leader Vikar Rasool Wani is contesting elections from Banihal. The NC-Congress has forged a pre-poll alliance, though fighting on separate manifestoes. For the first time, the BJP has fielded seven candidates in south Kashmir. The party is contesting from Rajpora, Shopian, Kokernag, Anantnag-43, Anantnag-44, Srigufwara-Bijbehara and Shangus-Anantnag seats. In the Chenab valley, with more Muslim voters than Hindus, the BJP is contesting on all eight seats and is banking on two Muslim candidates, Taraq Hussain Keen for the Inderwal seat, and Mohd. Saleem Bhat for the Banihal seat. It has fielded Shagun Parihar from Kishtwar, Sunil Kumar Sharma from Padder-Nagseni, Daleep Singh from Bhaderwah, Gajay Singh Rana from Doda, Shakti Raj Parihar from Doda-West and Rakesh Singh Thakur from Ramban. \u201cThere was a time when people thought the BJP wouldn\u2019t gain acceptance in Kashmir. The situation is different today. People are eager to listen to the BJP and understand our message. We are confident that we will win this election,\u201d senior BJP leader, and the party\u2019s election in-charge of J&K, Ram Madhav said. Engineer Rashid, released on a 22-day bail, also concluded his campaigning for the first phase in Shopian district on Monday. He targeted the NC and the PDP leadership for \u201cfailing to address the concerns and aspirations of the people of J&K\u201d. \u201cMs. Mufti forged an illegitimate alliance with the BJP to stay in power. Mr. Abdullah has added to the miseries of the people of Kashmir during his rule,\u201d Mr. Rashid said. His party is supporting 13 candidates in south Kashmir. Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, V.K. Birdi, on Monday said an elaborate security plan has been made for the first phase of elections in J&K. \u201cA multi-tier security system is in place for safe movement of security forces, security at booths, and polling stations. Quick Response Teams, Special Response Teams, and inter-district checkpoints have been made more effective to ensure seamless security,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Amid the ongoing political slugfest over Rahul Gandhi's remark on the condition of the Sikh community in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (September 16) in a veiled remark slammed the latter, stating that while many people in the country aspire to be brand ambassadors, some are trying to disrupt national unity. \"On one hand, every person in the country wants to be India's brand ambassador. On the other hand, some people, filled with negativity, are attacking the unity of the country,\" PM Modi said during a public event in Ahmedabad. \"Sardar Patel unified more than 500 princely states and integrated them into India. However, these power-hungry individuals now want to disintegrate the country,\" he added. Significantly, in reference to the upcoming Assembly Elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the Prime Minister during his speech further continued targeting the Congress and its ally, the National Conference, over their stance on reinstating Article 370 if they return to power. \"They are claiming that they will reinstate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. These people can go to any extent for appeasement. Filled with hate, they are leaving no opportunity to defame India,\" he said. \"They are persistently targeting Gujarat, so Gujarat needs to remain vigilant,\" he added.",

            "description": "Locals send out search parties to find 49 fishermen who had set out in three trawlers on Saturday. Contact established with 31 fishermen on two boats off the coast in the Sundarbans",
            "content": "Amid heavy rain that disrupted normal life in West Bengal, 49 fishermen, who had ventured into the Bay of Bengal from Diamond Harbour and Kwakdip near the Sundarbans on Saturday, are stranded in the sea. Local fishermen have contacted 31 men in two trawlers that had set sail from Diamond Harbour even as the third trawler with 18 fishermen is untraceable. Joy Krishna Haldar, general secretary of the United Fishermen Association of West Bengal, told The Hindu that they \u201cpleaded\u201d with the Coast Guard and Navy to send out search parties. \u201cBut they did not help much and said the sea was too turbulent. They said their rescue vessels are in the high seas. So we sent out six of our trawlers to rescue our fellow fishermen,\u201d he said. While two trawlers and the fishermen are being towed back to safety, families of fishermen in the third trawler have filed missing reports in local police stations. Mr. Haldar said the 18 fishermen who had ventured from the Kwakdip coast still remained in danger as their rescue parties have failed to establish any contact. West Bengal received \u201clargely excess rainfall\u201d between September 13 and 15, which continued till Monday morning when the three trawlers went missing in the sea. In its official statement on September 13, the India Meteorological Department, Kolkata, (IMD) had said, \u201cDeep depression over Gangetic West Bengal... it is likely to move slowly, nearly westwards across Gangetic West Bengal and maintain its intensity of deep depression till evening of September 15.\u201d It had issued a warning for coastal regions saying the sea conditions may likely be \u201crough to very rough\u201d and added, \u201cFishermen are advised not to venture into the sea along and off West Bengal-Bangladesh and Odisha coasts and North Bay of Bengal till September 16.\u201d The stranded fishermen had ventured into the deep sea in the search for hilsa, said sources. Officials also went around the coastal areas of the Sundarbans and urged fishermen not to go into the sea. They advised them to tie their trawlers and boats to coastal barricades. The local authorities have started a control room in the area to help distressed people. Houses collapse Multiple mud houses collapsed across Bengal as rain lashed 18 of the 23 districts. A woman died at the Block II area of Bankura district in a wall collapse. The victim was identified as Jyotsna Bagdi, 54. This is the second such death in the district this monsoon. In Birbhum\u2019s Nanoor area, a family of four were injured after their kutcha house caved in. Two children, aged 11 and 14, are in critical condition. In Paschim Medinipur district, multiple areas of Ghatal have been submerged. Locals agitated as flooding has become a yearly problem in the region despite multiple assurances by the authorities. Ghatal\u2019s Trinamool Congress MP, film actor Deepak Adhikari, visited the affected areas and assured the locals of immediate action. \u201cWater in the river is running above danger levels. We are assessing the gravity of the situation. We will ensure there is no lack of potable water and food. We will make provisions to take immediate action in case of snake bites and provide anti-venom,\u201d he said. Mr. Adhikari said the Ghatal Master Plan will solve the issue in the area. \u201cWe are in talks with all stakeholders. By this year-end we should be able to start the first phase of work. We cannot fight natural disasters, but what we can do is stand by our people,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Four agricultural labourers from West Bengal collapsed of starvation in Dr.MGR Chennai Central Railway Station on Monday after they reportedly did not have money to buy food for two days. One of them is on a ventilator in Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). The three other labourers who were admitted to the hospital are stable. Chennai Corporation officials rescued the homeless agricultural labourers and provided them food and shelter. \u201cWe have rescued seven persons from West Bengal, provided food and accommodation at the shelter for the homeless run by the Chennai Corporation. We are monitoring the condition of the persons admitted in the hospital,\u201d said Jagadeesan, City Health Officer, Greater Chennai Corporation. The labourer, who is on a ventilator in the RGGGH, has been identified as Manik Ghori, 50, of Mangrul village in West Midnapore of West Bengal. According to officials, 11 agricultural labourers from West Bengal had come to Tamil Nadu six days ago, looking for agricultural work in Ponneri, on the outskirts of Chennai. They reportedly stayed in Ponneri for three days and on not being able to get employed as agricultural labourers, they decided to return to West Bengal. On their way home, they stayed in Chennai Central Railway Station without having money to buy food. As they had not eaten for two days, four of them collapsed of starvation at 9.05 a.m. on platform number 4 of Central Railway Station on Monday. One of the eleven labourers had reportedly left for West Bengal in Howrah Mail on Sunday night, leaving the others in the railway station. They were shifted to RGGGH after being given first aid in Apollo Emergency Care Centre. The other three labourers \u2014 Satya Pandit, 33, Samar Khan, 35, and Asit Pandit, 35, also belong to the same village Mangrul in West Bengal as Manik Ghori. One of them has been discharged from the hospital on Monday, officials said. . Published - September 16, 2024 10:22 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "Trinamool Congress leaders continue to target junior doctors on strike in West Bengal. A key Minister and an MLA have ridiculed the resident doctors who are continuing their 37-day protest demanding justice for the woman doctor who was raped and killed on duty at Kolkata\u2019s R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9. In a video that surfaced online on Monday, Rajarhat-New Town MLA Tapash Chatterjee was heard saying, \u201cClapping and disco dance does not ensure the success of a movement. They can only ensure common people are inconvenienced. A true movement has a certain manner of progressing.\u201d In his public address, Mr. Chatterjee highlighted that the Chief Minister had visited the junior doctors\u2019 protest site outside the State Health Department headquarters (Swasthya Bhawan) at Salt Lake, invited them to her residence for a discussion, waited for hours on Saturday night for them to enter her house, and how she also offered the delegation tea. In a similar vein, senior Minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury on Monday strongly condemned the protests by junior doctors, calling their movement \u201chypocritical\u201d and \u201cmore than what is necessary.\u201d \u2018Political force\u2019 \u201cThere is a political force playing in the background. Do doctors dabble in politics? They are saying they do not trust the Chief Minister, but they certainly trust her when they receive their salary,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury told local mediapersons. \u201cThey are testing the patience of the common people, which they should not.\u201d He also alleged that protesters seek instability and that they deliberately wish to clash with the police. \u201cWhat kind of education have they [the doctors] received? The Chief Minister has manners, which is why she is not openly criticising their antics,\u201d the Trinamool Congress Minister added. Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress leader Kunal Ghosh shared audio clips that allegedly depict arguments between protesting junior doctors over arriving at an understanding with the government. He claimed that there are two conflicting groups of doctors \u2014 one which wants a solution and end to the deadlock, and the another which doesn\u2019t. In the audio of the phone conversation, two voices, allegedly belonging to protesting doctors, can be heard arguing. One of them said the other should take responsibility if punitive action is taken against all protesting resident doctors and chalked it up to the latter\u2019s unwillingness to carry forward discussions with the State administration. \u201cSome circles want this impasse [between protesting doctors and the government] to continue. Despite the Chief Minister making requests to them like a parent, some circles do not want to cooperate because they want this deadlock to continue,\u201d Mr. Ghosh said. \u201cIt is worth examining whether people with political interests are trying to mislead and exploit the emotions of the protesting doctors.\u201d Deny allegations Representatives of the West Bengal Junior Doctors\u2019 Front denied these allegations on Monday prior to their meeting with the Chief Minister. \u201cMany people have alleged that we have no intentions of conducting a discussion or coming to a resolution, but that is false,\u201d a protesting doctor, Kinjal Nanda, said on Monday. \u201cTime and again we tried to see whether the administration is equally willing to do so. The fight that we are fighting is to uncover the truth and ensure justice is served.\u201d Earlier, Trinamool Congress leaders Kalyan Bandopadhyay, Lovely Maitra, Kanchan Mullick, Udayan Guha and Atish Sarkar stirred controversy by making caustic remarks about the agitating doctors and issuing threats to them.

            "description": "According to sources, the BJP is likely to lead the panels on Finance and Defence while the SP will head the committee on Health. DMK and Trinamool will head one panel each",
            "content": "After prolonged negotiations, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has conceded the chair of Department-related Standing Committees on External Affairs, Agriculture, Rural Development and Education to the Congress. A notification is expected shortly. In 2014, with the Congress tally at just 44 MPs, the party held the chair of parliamentary panels on External Affairs and Finance. External Affairs was then headed by senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor and Finance by Veerappa Moily. Both sides have ceded space. The Congress had begun negotiations demanding External Affairs, Finance, Defence and Home Affairs. The government had refused to hand over even one of these four panels. It argued that since the Congress as the principal Opposition party heads the Public Accounts Committee, which audits all government expenditure, it need not be given finance. According to sources, the BJP is likely to lead the panels on Finance and Defence. Among BJP\u2019s Lok Sabha MPs are former Chief Ministers Biplab Deb and Basavaraj S Bommai. It is also likely to accommodate its two key allies, Telugu Desam Party and JD(U), though based on its numerical strength the TDP is not eligible to head the panel. Other parties Sources also said that the Samajwadi Party will be heading the Standing Committee on Health. Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav chaired the panel during the previous Lok Sabha. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Trinamool Congress will head one panel each. There are 24 Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committees. Out of these, 16 committees come within the ambit of the Lok Sabha and are chaired by a Lok Sabha member and the rest are under the Rajya Sabha. The committees provide an additional layer of scrutiny and accountability for the government, since these are non-partisan platforms where the members are not bound by the party\u2019s whip. With just four seats, the Congress has another tricky problem on its hands. In picking the chair of these four panels, it will have to balance the caste and regional factors. Much like BJP, Congress also has two former Chief Ministers - former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi and Puducherry Chief Minister V. Vaithilingam.

            "content": "The Ministry of External Affairs highlighted that Iran's remark was not based on accurate information. The Ministry of External Affairs of India has issued a strong statement in response to remarks made by the Supreme Leader of Iran concerning minorities in India. In the statement, India expressed its disapproval of the comments, calling them \"misinformed and unacceptable.\" The ministry highlighted that such remarks were not based on accurate information and advised nations to first reflect on their own track record regarding minorities before passing judgments on others. The government underscored that it would not tolerate any misrepresentation of its treatment of minorities, implicitly suggesting that Iran should look inward before making such observations. \"We strongly deplore the comments made regarding minorities in India by the Supreme Leader of Iran. These are misinformed and unacceptable. Countries commenting on minorities are advised to look at their own record before making any observations about others,\" said the MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. Statement on Unacceptable Comments made by the Supreme Leader of Iran: https://t.co/Db94FGChaF pic.twitter.com/MpOFxtfuRO \u2014 Randhir Jaiswal (@MEAIndia) September 16, 2024 This official stance comes in the wake of diplomatic sensitivities between the two countries, showcasing India's firm response to external criticisms regarding its domestic matters. Earlier in the day, Khamenei highlighted the 'suffering' of Muslims in regions such as India, Gaza, and Myanmar, urging for greater solidarity among global communities. \"We cannot consider ourselves to be Muslims if we are oblivious to the suffering that a Muslim is enduring in #Myanmar, #Gaza, #India, or any other place,\" the Iranian leader said in his post on X.",

            "content": "BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal has written to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das, alleging an \u201cunhealthy nexus\u201d between banks, e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart, and brand owners, and urged the RBI to issue \u201cimmediate directions to banks to cease offering exclusive discounts and cashback benefits\u201d that are not extended to traditional retailers. Mr. Khandelwal, who is also the secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), has also urged the central bank chief to initiate an investigation into banks\u2019 partnerships with e-tailers and their impact on purchasing patterns such as the proliferation of online mobile phone purchases using bank cards. Flagging \u201caggressive discounting strategies and bank cashback offers\u201d with discounts as high as 10% on e-commerce platforms, Mr. Khandelwal argued the collusion between banks, e-tailers and smartphone producers is distorting the retail ecosystem, with around 1.5 lakh retailers struggling due to these unfair practices, and over 50,000 small businesses shutting down already. This, he said, is also driving many small traders to rely on \u201cgrey market\u201d stocks, and asserted that \u201cknowingly or unknowingly\u201d, banks have become part of a cartel creating \u201can unhealthy, uneven market\u201d, posing serious challenges to competition and the fundamental right to trade. The MP also sought time with the RBI chief along with representatives of the All India Mobile Retailers Association. \u201cProtecting both retailers and the financial integrity of our banking sector is of utmost importance. Breaking this nexus is essential for safeguarding our economy,\u201d he concluded in his missive to Mr. Das.

            "content": "The Karnataka State Commission for Women has directed the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) to constitute a Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Committee within the chamber. The chamber has been given a 15-day deadline to respond. \u201cThe Supreme Court orders the establishment of a PoSH Committee in any workplace that has 10 or more women in it. It\u2019s high time the Kannada film industry had one such committee for women to have the confidence to tackle sexual harassment,\u201d said Nagalakshmi Chowdhary, chairperson of the commission. Ms. Chowdhary, along with members of the Film Industry For Rights and Equality (FIRE), led by filmmaker Kavitha Lankesh \u2014 an association formed in the wake of the #MeToo movement in 2018 \u2014 attended a meeting at the chamber on Monday (Sept. 16). They submitted a list of 17 demands concerning the working conditions of women in the industry. However, there was significant opposition to FIRE\u2019s demand for a committee that could speak confidentially with female artists in the industry to compile a report on the challenges they face. N.M. Suresh, Chairman of KFCC, expressed skepticism about the productivity of such a committee, similar to the Hema Committee in the Malayalam film industry. \u201cThe chamber\u2019s responsibility is to address the problems of the industry and provide appropriate solutions. Why do we need an additional committee? We encourage female artists to come forward and share their concerns with us. So far, neither the Women\u2019s Commission nor the KFCC has received official complaints of sexual harassment from women in the industry,\u201d Suresh stated. Kavitha Lankesh, President of FIRE, said, \u201cIf the industry\u2019s leaders believe that there haven\u2019t been enough women raising their voices for a healthier work environment, this research and the subsequent report will prove them wrong.\u201d FIRE has already submitted a petition to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, requesting the formation of a committee headed by a retired judge to investigate the working conditions of women in the Kannada film industry, similar to the Hema Committee that exposed widespread sexual harassment in the Malayalam film industry.

            "content": "Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has completed the cleaning of Okkiyam Maduvu waterway and has increased the capacity of the vents, way ahead of the monsoon season. This waterway plays a significant role in collecting excess floodwater from the southern areas during monsoon and taking it to the confluence point with Bay of Bengal at Muttukadu. During the floods in December 2023 caused by Cyclone Michaung, the carrying capacity of the Okkiyam Maduvu bridge was insufficient and hence it was decided that the vents should be expanded, according to a press release. \u201cSubsequently, to address this, a meeting was held at the Secretariat, and it was decided to increase the capacity of the vent to 200 m with an addition of 1.5-m vertical clearance. The work is part of the construction of a two-lane road on the bridge with a provision of three additional lanes on either side,\u201d the release said. The CMRL has finished the pile work for the two-lane road, completed the cleaning of the Maduvu and now, the five vents have bigger capacity to take in the surge of water. The CMRL will take up the remaining work when the monsoon ends. Published - September 16, 2024 10:01 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Once the victim sends a QR code, the fraudster take control of the phone and the original SIM becomes inactive",
            "content": "The Kerala Police have issued an advisory about a scam targeting those transitioning to e-SIM technology. The alert comes as fraudsters exploit the shift to electronic SIM cards to execute sophisticated scams. The sleuths have highlighted the modus operandi of the scam involving fraudsters posing as customer care representatives from mobile phone service providers to deceive users into switching to the e-SIM system. The scammers contact victims, advising them to replace their physical SIM card with an e-SIM by entering a 32-digit e-ID through the mobile service provider\u2019s application or website. The victims are instructed to activate their e-SIM using the e-ID and to send the QR code received to a WhatsApp number given by the fraudsters. Once the fraudsters receive the QR code, they use it to activate the e-SIM, gaining full control over the victim\u2019s phone number. As a result, the victim\u2019s original SIM card becomes inactive. The scammers then exploit their access to the victim\u2019s mobile number to gain control over linked bank accounts, usually within a 24-hour window promised for e-SIM activation. In light of such threats, the police have emphasised steps to avoid falling victim to such scams. Mobile users have been advised to confirm the legitimacy of any calls or messages claiming to be from customer care centres. One should always rely on the official application or website of mobile service providers for various services. QR codes, OTPs (one-time passwords), or passwords should never be shared with anyone. Enhanced security features including \u2018two-step verification\u2019 should be utilised for all digital accounts to add an extra layer of security against unauthorised access.

The announcement was made at the 10th edition of the Bangalore Business Literature Festival held on September 14. The award was presented by Ajai Chowdhry, co-founder of HCL Ltd. According to a press release, The Learning Trap is an investigative work on how a multi-billion-dollar valuation company fumbled and is now fighting for survival. It is a lesson for companies that focus excessively on the valuation route instead of a profitable route for growth. It is also a big lesson for startup founders on the importance of governance and stakeholder transparency. The book was inspired by the author asking a simple question - where was hundreds of millions of investor money going and what where were the learning outcomes? Much before he could stumble on the answers The Morning Context had uncovered the dark underbelly of ed-tech and how the biggest ed-tech company could become the biggest write-down in India\u2019s tech start-up history. The book is published by Juggernaut. The jury included journalist and climate activist Madhur Singh, innovation consultant Bhupendra Sharma and IIM Ahmedabad professor Mukesh Sood.

            "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (September 16, 2024) inaugurated the fourth Global Renewable Energy Investors\u2019 Meet and Expo (RE-INVEST) in his home State of Gujarat, and said that India was at the forefront of developing renewable energy sources, including solar power, to fight climate change. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Modi said 140 crore Indians had pledged to make the country the world\u2019s third largest economy, and the renewable energy sector would power the country\u2019s rapid economic growth in the years to come. \u201cIndia aims to not only reach the top but to sustain at the position,\u201d Mr. Modi said, adding that the world believes India is the best bet of the 21st century. \u201cIndia is preparing a base not only for today but for the next thousand years,\u201d he said, adding that in the first 100 days of his third term, the government had taken multiple decisions to expand physical and social infrastructure. The PM outlined some of the major announcements of his government in this time, including the decisions to create 12 new industrial cities and eight high-speed road corridor projects; the launch of over 15 semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains; promoting research with the inception of a fund worth \u20b91 trillion; various initiatives to drive e-mobility; high-performance biomanufacturing and the Bio-E3 policy. The creation of a viability gap funding scheme for offshore wind energy projects worth more than \u20b97,000 crore was a big move to promote off-shore wind farms in the coastal States, he said. India has been well aware of its energy requirements to make it a developed nation by 2047, and had decided to build its future on the basis of renewable energy sources, including solar power, wind power, nuclear power and hydro power, he said, because conventional energy supply sources were depleting and were also highly polluting. \u201cIndia is the first G20 nation to achieve the climate commitments set in Paris \u2014 nine years before the deadline,\u201d the PM said in his inaugural address at the event, in the presence of several Chief Ministers and other functionaries, and delegates from around 40 countries. Lauding State governments for developing solar and wind energy infrastructure, he emphasised the government\u2019s target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030, and said that the government had \u201cturned the green transition into a people\u2019s movement\u201d. During his speech, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader also recalled his re-election as Prime Minister for a third term, and added that the country\u2019s aspirations were the reason for it. Mr. Modi also stressed that the poor, Dalits and deprived believed that the government\u2019s third term would become a guarantee for a dignified life for marginalised sections of society. India is on the path to constructing seven crore houses, more than the population of many countries, while four crore houses had already been handed out to beneficiaries in the previous two terms, since 2014, the PM said. The country is also working towards producing 31,000 MW of hydropower with an outlay of \u20b912,000 crore, he said. On the first day of the event, several States announced their plans for the development of renewable energy sources. Gujarat has pledged renewable energy capacity addition of 128.60 GW by 2030 \u2014 the highest among all the States. Andhra Pradesh has committed to adding 72.60 GW capacity, followed by Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh at 62.73 GW, 57.71 GW, and 47.63 GW, respectively. Minister of New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi said banks and financial institutions had committed to an additional $386 billion (\u20b932.45 lakh crore) financing by 2030 for project development.

The party said that its manifesto aims to address the pressing issues faced by the people of the region and has been crafted with input from a committee that engaged with various cross-sections of society across all districts.

            "content": "Former Director-General of the Assam Rifles, Lieutenant-General Pradeep Chandran Nair (retd), said the only sincere attempt for a dialogue between the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities in Manipur last year was derailed, when a video of two Kuki-Zo women being stripped and paraded by a mob surfaced on social media on July 19. In an interview with The Hindu , Lt.-General Nair said though the violence erupted around 2.30 p.m. on May 3, 2023, the State government requisitioned the deployment of Assam Rifles only at 8.30 p.m. as \u201cthey were still trying to figure out whether they can handle it [violence] on their own\u201d. The Assam Rifles is deployed for counter-insurgency operations in the Northeast and is the primary border-guarding force along Myanmar. Also read: Manipur ethnic conflict characterised by brutality: Data Lt.-General Nair said there were inputs about simmering tensions between the two communities since March 27, 2023, following a Manipur High Court order. The court directed the State government to submit a recommendation for the inclusion of Meiteis in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list and to consider the proposal preferably within four weeks. He stated that the Assam Rifles and Army had kept troops on standby even before May 3, when violence broke out simultaneously at \u201cthree to four places\u201d after a tribal solidarity march to protest the high court order. \u201cWe get criticised that it is a total intelligence failure, but we were quite aware. From the time the court directives were passed, the rumblings could be heard, the undercurrents were there,\u201d said Lt.-General Nair, who headed the force from June 1, 2021 to July 31 this year. He added that without receiving any directions, the Assam Rifles and the Army decided that there was a necessity to keep some columns ready. \u201cWe assumed that 15-20 columns would be enough at Churachandpur and Imphal, from the time of the court decision. After the State requested deployment on May 3, our columns were out on the ground within 30 minutes. If we we were not ready, then the killings would have been much higher, at least 2,000 to 3,000 people would have been killed in the first few days. The Inspector-General, Assam Rifles, was at the Chief Minister\u2019s Office at 3.30 p.m., yet we waited for requisition which came at 8.30 p.m.,\u201d he added. In the first one week, around 65 people were killed in the violence and in the past 16 months, at least 237 people had been killed and more than 60,000 people displaced. He added that one of the ways to solve the current crisis is through backchannel discussions among the two communities, adding that the Assam Rifles and the Indian Army initiated a dialogue between the two communities in June 2023 after Home Minister Amit Shah\u2019s visit from May 31-June 3. \u201cWe got in touch with some of the people, including from Meira Paibi and important civil society organisations, there was a lot of reluctance. Finally they agreed to meet, sometime in first week of July. We wanted to meet at a neutral place and it was agreed that it will be in Guwahati. But unfortunately, a week or 10 days later, the video of women being stripped and paraded went viral.... and then it took a totally different turn, the rest as they say is history... Because feelings got caustic after that, both the communities were not willing to meet thereafter. This was one of the sincere attempts we made, I am not sure of any other attempt made by any other organisation. We got the Army on board,\u201d he said. He mentioned that involving the political leadership was the next step. On being asked if the current crisis was a security or a political issue, the retired D-G said, \u201cSecurity forces can only try and arrest violence which they have done to a large extent... We saved nothing less than 2,000-3,000 lives between May 3-5.... by the third night we had 100 columns in place. The number of people that we put in our vehicles with no support from the State government, obviously because they themselves were in a flux, we transported hundreds and hundreds of people through night and day and saved them.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 09:53 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Manipur / Caste violence",

            "content": "Five youths were killed in separate road accidents in Thiruvananthapuram district on Thiruvonam day on Sunday. Three persons were killed and two critically injured when two motorcycles collided with each other at Kurakkani Junction, near Varkala, around 11.15 p.m. The deceased were identified as Anandabose, 19, Adithyan, 19, of Karippuram near Edava, and Jishnu, 20, of Punnamoodu near Varkala. Two others, Sanoj of Thottamugham, and Vishnu of Janardhanapuram, were admitted to the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital. The authorities blamed the accident on violations of motor safety rules. While one two-wheeler carried three riders, the other came from the opposite direction with a faulty headlight, the police said. In another incident, an Onam reveller was killed when a speeding motorcycle rammed a crowd at Sasthavattom in Mangalapuram. Sasthavattom native Shyju, 45, who had come to see the celebrations, was knocked down by the bike. The rider, Roshan Raj of Perunguzhi, sustained serious injuries. A biker was killed when his motorcycle rammed a tree near the Infosys campus. Anuraj, 27, of Poundkadavu succumbed to his injuries, while two other passengers have been admitted to the medical college hospital with grievous injuries.

            "content": "The Communist Party of India (Marxist) held a motorcycle rally at Payakaraopeta in the Anakapalli district on Monday, September 16, demanding the government take legal action against the pharma and other industries in Special Economic Zones (SEZ) that flout safety norms. They demanded that the government ensures strict implementation of safety regulations. Addressing the participants, CPI(M) State committee member M. Jaggunaidu demanded that the government stop being lenient towards factory managements which failed to implement the safety parameters. He said that the governments were doing injustice to those who parted with their lands in the hope that their children would get employment in the industries set up on their lands. The 75% reservation to displaced persons and locals was not being implemented by the managements. Mr. Jaggunaidu asked, \u201cWhat is the use of such industries which go on polluting the environment and ignoring the accidents caused by their negligence? What is the use if they do not even provide job security to the locals?\u201d The failure to abide by the pollution control rules was causing various health problems to the local people, Mr. Jaggunaidu alleged, adding that indifference of the managements had resulted in the death of 17 workers in Escientia Pharma and four workers in Synergene Pharma recently. However, cases have not been booked against the managements so far he alleged. CPI(M) district secretary K. Lokanadham, who led the bike rally, alleged that the central and State governments were neglecting the safety aspect while granting approval for establishing industries. He also sought provision of safety gear to workers and employees to prevent injuries and deaths at the workplace. CPI(M) district leaders M. Appalaraju, G. Koteswara Rao, R. Sankara Rao, R. Ramu G. Satyanarayana, G. Sriram and V.V. Srinivasa Rao were among those who participated in the bike rally.

Thirumavalavan, on Monday met Chief Minister and DMK president M. K. Stalin at Anna Arivalayam. He reportedly spoke in private for a few minutes and invited the DMK for the liquor prohibition rally to be held on October 2 in Kallakurichi. Mr. Thirumavalavan said the DMK organising secretary R.S. Bharathi and spokesperson T.K.S. Elangovan would participate in the rally. Mr. Thirumavalavan told journalists there were no issues between DMK and VCK. \u201cThere are no cracks in the DMK-VCK ties,\u201d he said, adding that the liquor prohibition rally would pass resolutions to urge the State government to reduce the \u2018revenue targets\u2019 for Tasmac liquor outlets and call for a national policy for prohibition of liquor. \u201cApart from what is being used for medicinal purposes, alcohol and drugs meant for retail sale should not be available for sale. Annadurai (DMK\u2019s first Chief Minister) had supported a national policy for prohibition of liquor. Perarignar Anna was firm about liquor prohibition and had urged the Centre to implement prohibition based on Article 47,\u201d he said. The party had urged Mr Stalin to push the Union government for a national policy. \u201cMr Stalin said he will support our demand for a national policy to the Union government. He also said the DMK agreed with the fact that liquor prohibition should be implemented in Tamil Nadu but there were administrative issues. He informed that liquor prohibition would be implemented in a step by step manner,\u201d the VCK leader said. In his representation to Mr Stalin, he said the State government must urge the Union government to formulate a national liquor prohibition policy, set up the Prohibition Enquiry Commission as it was done in 1954, provide compensation to States that are implementing prohibition to overcome loss of revenue, and ensure that the States get more share from the Union government for implementing prohibition. Sources in the VCK said the meeting was cordial with the Chief Minister and Ministers. \u201cNobody discussed the issue of why we are talking about power sharing right now. It looked like they had already discussed it among themselves. But, Mr. Stalin said the VCK should be with the DMK when it celebrates 100 th anniversary,\u201d said a senior leader. He also added that the VCK leader was unlikely to meet with AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami and invite the party for the liquor prohibition rally.

Against the capacity to admit 500 candidates, the admission to the programme for the previous batch was a little above 200, it is learnt. According to university sources, the vacant seats could not be filled since the B.Ed. distance education programme is meant only for in-service teachers employed in government or government-aided schools. Only those who had completed Diploma in Teacher Education and were working in government schools are eligible to upgrade their qualification with B.Ed. degree. The State universities have, for long, been urging the government to relax the norms for admission to B.Ed. Distance Education programme to include in-service teachers in private schools as well, but to no avail. There have been instances of private schools conducting campus interviews in colleges and recruiting fresh graduates without B.Ed. degree for the teaching jobs. However, the school managements struggle to justify their eligibility at the time of inspection by the School Education Department authorities. When there is a genuine need, there is no reason why teachers appointed without B.Ed. qualification must not be allowed to pursue the degree through distance education, a headmaster of a government school reasoned out.

However, India TV does not independently verify the claim. The post also references a recent shooting incident at the Highway King Hotel on the Rajasthan-Delhi border, which the gang claimed credit for. Kaushal Chaudhary, the leader of the gang, is currently incarcerated in Bhondsi Jail and is facing over 40 criminal charges. His criminal record includes high-profile cases such as the murder of Punjab Akali leader Vicky Middukhera, the killing of Punjabi Kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal Abhiha, and the assassination of Haryana Congress Youth President. Chaudhary is also linked to Sagunpreet, a manager associated with the late Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, who resides abroad. Investigative agencies are currently working to verify the authenticity of the gang's claims and assess the broader implications of these incidents.

            "content": "Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy launched a scathing attack on Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) leaders saying they would never understand the true meaning of sacrifice and the sacrifices made by the Nehru-Gandhi family as their 10-year rule focussed only on looting Telangana. The Chief Minister, who unveiled Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s statue in front of the Secretariat on Monday, reiterated his charge that the BRS deliberately didn\u2019t install the Telangana Talli statue as the space was reserved for a statue of BRS chief K. Chandrashekhar Rao. He said Rajiv Gandhi was responsible for the technological revolution in the country and BRS leader K. T. Rama Rao was one of the beneficiaries of that revolution like lakhs of Indians abroad. Questioning the BRS opposition to Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s statue, he said wasn\u2019t it Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s wife Sonia Gandhi who gave Telangana fully aware that the party would lose Andhra Pradesh forever? Sonia sacrificed for Telangana and those who looted Telangana have no right to question. Sacrifice is staying away from power like Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and not enjoying power unlike KCR\u2019s family which not only stayed in power for 10 years taking all political positions. Further, KCR could build farmhouses on hundreds of acres, a new vastu-compliant Secretariat intending to change his son\u2019s fortunes, and Pragati Bhavan spending thousands of crores but didn\u2019t have time for the Telangana Tallli statue in 10 years. The actual reason was that the present space was reserved for KCR\u2019s statue, he claimed. Recalling Chakali Ilamma\u2019s resolve that feudal lords\u2019 palatial houses should be overgrown with weeds and abandoned forever, the Chief Minister warned that Congress would not rest till the farmhouses of KCR\u2019s family see a similar plight. Mr. Revanth Reddy said a massive Telangana Talli statue would be installed inside the Secretariat on December 9 this year, he asked R&B Minister Komatireddy Venkata Reddy to show the Congress party\u2019s true respect for Telangana Talli. Attacks KCR Questioning KCR\u2019s respect for Telangana, he reminded that the former CM did not even pay his last respects to the noted Telangana fighter Konda Laxman Bapuji, who sacrificed his residence for the launch of the TRS party. \u201cWe have named Indian Institute of Handloom Technology after Konda Bapuji, Women\u2019s university after Chakali Ilamma and now the Telugu University would be named after Suravaram Pratap Reddy,\u201d he declared. TPCC president Mahesh Kumar Goud, all the ministers and senior leaders of the party attended the programme.

The police got remand of the man, identified as Satyajit Barath Kamble, for four days till Monday (September 16, 2024), and he would be produced before the district magistrate on Tuesday (September 17, 2024), officials said. \u201cThe accused, posing as an Army Major, was running a massive recruitment racket across Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Haryana and New Delhi, along with accomplices. They have duped hundreds of candidates under pretext of providing them jobs in the Army and the Military Engineer Services,\u201d a police statement said.

Candidates were also approached directly at recruitment drives asking them to join the training camps. Even counterfeit joining letters in the name of Ex Southern Army Commander, Chief Engineer Officer and other such posts in the Army were issued, police revealed.

It issued them identity cards as trainees, the statement said. An investigation is under way and the number of accomplices to Mr. Kamble is expected to be more, given the large number of affected candidates.

            "content": "A number of students on Monday staged a protest at the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University following the suicide of a 25-year-old student Gautam Kumar who was recently expelled by the university administration. Hundreds of students gathered outside the Vice-Chancellor's office, and held a sit-in to demand justice for the deceased. The protesting students chanted slogans calling for accountability from the university. They carried posters reading - \"Justice for Gautam\" and \"Don't Let the Suicide Note Disappear\". Protesters also demanded the resignation of warden Rakesh Kumar, accusing him of expelling the students without conducting a proper investigation. According to IP University registrar Kamal Pathak, the university administration has 'relieved' hostel warden Rakesh Kumar of his duties after students staged protests. As per the expulsion order dated September 14, Gautam and five other students were removed from hostel residency for consuming alcohol and narcotic substances. The order prohibited them from entering the hostel premises and directed them to vacate their rooms by 2 pm on September 15. Gautam Kumar, a first-year MBA student, allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the seventh floor of his hostel building on Sunday. He was a native of Vaishali in Bihar and was enrolled at the IP University main campus in Dwarka Sector-16, Southwest Delhi. He was expelled for allegedly consuming alcohol and narcotic substances in his hostel room along with five other students. According to students, he was distressed after being expelled following a birthday party celebration in the hostel. (With PTI inputs)",

            "content": "As part of the Kremlin's efforts to address the birth rate issue, workers are being encouraged to use their lunch and coffee breaks to focus on family expansion. In response to Russia\u2019s plummeting birth rate, President Vladimir Putin is reportedly encouraging citizens to make use of their work breaks for intimate relations. The country\u2019s fertility rate, currently standing at around 1.5 children per woman, falls significantly short of the 2.1 children per woman required to sustain population growth. According to the report by the 'Metro', This suggestion comes as Russia faces a population crisis, exacerbated by a declining birth rate and significant emigration, particularly of younger people, amid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. Putin\u2019s Call to Action According to media reports, Putin has emphasized the importance of increasing the population. \"The preservation of the Russian people is our highest national priority. The fate of Russia depends on how many of us there will be. It is a matter of national importance,\" he reportedly stated. As part of the Kremlin's efforts to address the birth rate issue, workers are being encouraged to use their lunch and coffee breaks to focus on family expansion. Dr. Yevgeny Shestopalov, Russia\u2019s Health Minister, highlighted the need to prioritize family planning, dismissing the notion that busy work schedules are a valid reason to delay having children. When questioned about how those working long hours could find time to focus on starting families, he suggested taking advantage of their break times. Alarming Decline in Births Russia\u2019s birth rate has hit its lowest level since 1999. In June 2024, the number of live births fell below 100,000, raising alarms about the country\u2019s demographic future. Data from Russia\u2019s national statistics agency, Rosstat, reveals that 16,000 fewer children were born between January and June 2024 compared to the same period the previous year. This sharp decline is accompanied by a rise in deaths, with 49,000 more deaths recorded in 2024, further compounding the population decrease. The ongoing conflict with Ukraine has also contributed to these demographic issues, with over a million Russians\u2014predominantly young people\u2014having left the country in recent years.",

            "description": "ED initiated probe on basis of several FIRs by various State police. Chinese scammers were part of their network",
            "content": "The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) have arrested four persons in a case related to cyber fraud. All the four accused were involved in incorporation of shell companies and opening of bank accounts, through which the proceeds of crime (PoC) generated from cyber scam were laundered. The arrested men have been identified as Tamilarasan Kuppan, 29, Prakash, 26, Aravindan, 23, and Ajith, 28, from Pallipattu. A Special Court, Bengaluru has granted ED custody of four days. Further, the ED has frozen PoC of \u20b92.8 crore in the bank account of a shell company M/s Cyberforest Technology Private Limited, run by the four persons ED initiated an investigation on the basis of several FIRs registered by various State police all over the country, including FIR No. 330 dated September 3, registered by Special Offences and Cyber Crime Police, Jaipur. The victim of the cyber fraud received a call from a mobile number wherein a person claimed to be calling from the Bombay Customs Office. During the call, it was communicated to the victim that illegal goods were being sent abroad under the victim\u2019s name. Then the victim was instructed to make a \u2018fund legalisation\u2019 payment as a security to ensure that no money had been illegally earned by the victim. A total amount of \u20b92.16 crore was asked to be transferred by the fraudsters in three separate instalments into three different accounts provided by the caller, under the guise of \u2018fund legalisation\u2019. Subsequently, an individual who claimed to be a CBI officer, contacted the victim over mobile phone. The fraudster continued to assert that he was a CBI officer. Furthermore, a call was received by the victim from someone who claimed to be DCP of Delhi Police, to verify the authenticity of the so-called CBI officer. On the insistence of so-called government officials, the victim was relieved of his entire life savings and investments, amounting to \u20b92.16 crore. By way of swift action by the ED, PoC to the tune of \u20b92.8 crore have been frozen in a Bandhan Bank account of the shell company M/s Cyberforest Technology Private Limited last Thursday, in which the proceeds were transferred by the victim. \u201cThe whole process and activities related to transactions in the bank accounts of these shell companies were done through a WhatsApp group where Tamilarasan, Ajith, Aravindan, Prakash along with Chinese scammers were members. Investigation has revealed that Tamilarasan, one of the arrested persons was in contact with Chinese cyber fraudsters, for siphoning off the amount of \u20b92.8 crore frozen in Bandhan Bank,\u201d said ED in a statement. It has also been revealed that Tamilarasan, Ajith, Prakash, Aravindan were actively involved in incorporation of shell companies and opening of bank accounts of these shell companies which were used to launder the proceeds of crime generated from various cyber frauds. Tamilarasan, in active assistance with Ajith, Prakash, Aravindan, ran a syndicate to assist cyber fraudsters in arranging dummy Directors, addresses and documents for incorporation of shell companies and liaisoning with bank personnel for opening of accounts through which proceeds of crime generated from cyber frauds were laundered. Earlier, ED had arrested four persons \u2014 M. Shashi Kumar, M. Sachin, S.K. Kiran and C. Charan Raj \u2014 on August 15 and 21 in Bengaluru. They are currently in judicial custody. So far, 17 searches were conducted at various premises which led to seizure of various incriminating material, including mobile phones and other digital devices and freezing of \u20b92.8 crore in the bank account. \u201cInvestigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 has, so far, identified PoC of more than \u20b928 crore generated from cyber scams. Further investigation is under progress,\u201d said the ED. Published - September 16, 2024 09:30 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "The five BJP MLAs of Udupi district and Kota Srinivas Poojary, Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP, alleged on Monday, September 16, that the State government is ignoring the district in development front. If the government continued the apathy without fulfilling the demands within the next 10 days, the MLAs and the MP would stage a dharna in front of the residence of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Bengaluru, they threatened. If the government does not respond even then, a people\u2019s movement will be launched against the government in the district, they said. Addressing a joint press conference in Udupi, V. Sunil Kumar, former Minister and Karkala MLA, said that the district administration had put the damages to properties due to the recent natural calamities at \u20b9240 crore. But the government has not released even a rupee as a relief. In addition, the government led by Congress did not announce any new project for the district in its two annual Budgets. It is because all the five MLAs of the district are from the BJP. \u201cIs it not sidelining the district?\u201d he asked. Alleging that the government has gone bankrupt, Mr. Kumar said that the government is frequently transferring taluk-level officials without valid reasons. District-level officials are not cooperating with MLAs in administration. He said that the government has not released any funds to take up pothole-filling works. Hence, the rural roads are in pathetic condition. \u201cAs a first step, we will stage a protest in front of the Chief Minister\u2019s residence. If the government fails to respond, as a second step we will launch a people\u2019s movement against the government,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. The former Minister said that the State government has planned to cancel 11 lakh BPL cards in the State. Of that, 40,000 cards are in Udupi district. As the government has not been able to reach out its guarantee schemes to all, it has now proposed to cancel the BPL cards, he alleged adding that it is a move to deceive people. The BJP will launch Assembly-wise agitation against it, he said. The MLA alleged that the district administration and Police Department are making unilateral decisions. The government is not adhering to the spirit and principles of democracy. MLAs Yashpal Suvarna, Gurme Suresh Shetty, Kiran Kodgi and Gururaja Ghantiholi were present.

            "content": "At a webinar held as a part of The Hindu Wellness Series on Sunday, doctors discussed the importance of early detection and prevention of cancer. Doctors from Naruvi Hospitals, Vellore \u2014 T. Allwyn Yabesh, senior consultant (medical oncology) and consultants Rahul Krishnan (surgical oncology), and G. Sindhu (medical oncology) \u2014 were the panellists for the webinar on \u2018Cancer : Prevention and Early Detection\u2019. \u201cWe are living in an era of non-communicable diseases, with cancer as the single biggest threat. But in 30% to 50% of situations, it is possible to prevent cancer if we change our lifestyle, behaviour, and exposure to elements that increase the risk factors,\u201d said Dr. Allwyn. \u201cThe remaining challenge depends on early diagnosis and effective treatment,\u201d he added, and advised people to keep obesity under check and quit smoking, alcohol, and unhealthy food such as ready-to-eat and frozen foods, which are ultra-processed and industrially manufactured with preservatives, emulsifiers, and artificial flavours. Dr. Sindhu showed a presentation on the importance of cancer screening to detect pre-cancers or early-stage cancers in asymptomatic individuals. \u201cScreening is a form of secondary prevention; timely diagnosis and early treatment can significantly improve outcomes by delaying or halting the disease progression, increasing cure rates and reducing morbidity and mortality,\u201d she said. She also reiterated the importance of mammography in women aged over 45 for diagnosing breast cancer and pap smear test at 21 years for detecting cervical cancer. Dr. Rahul Krishnan highlighted the importance of family history and recommended examination for breast, ovarian, colon, and stomach cancer, particularly among those who have hereditary risks and are aged below 50.

            "description": "The villagers were denied entry last month after the conduct of kumbhabhishekam by a group of caste Hindus",
            "content": "Residents of Vazhudambedu Colony in Gummidipoondi taluk in Tiruvallur district were able to enter and pray inside the Arulmigu Pidari Ettiamman temple after it was unsealed and reopened on Monday (September 16, 2024). The villagers, mostly belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs), were denied entry last month after the conduct of kumbhabhishekam by a group of caste Hindus of the village. District Collector T. Prabhu Shankar, who led the villagers into the temple, under the purview of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department, said that during peace talks, it was explained to the members of a dominant caste that they must live in peace with residents of the neighbouring colony. \u201cThe dispute arose after the Adi Dravidars were not allowed to use the pathway to the temple by persons of the caste Hindu group. Since the land actually belongs to the temple, we explained it to the residents of both communities and they agreed to come to a compromise,\u201d he said. The temple had been sealed on the day of the function to prevent deterioration of law and order. \u201cThe villagers had surrounded the temple on that day as soon as the yagasala pujas were completed. Complaints have been preferred by both the communities against each other and a First Information Report [FIR] against the dominant community was registered for discrimination,\u201d he added. Works to be taken up The Collector said works totalling \u20b978 lakh, including laying of cement concrete roads leading to the temple, and both the burial grounds of the residential localities, and construction of a shelter would be taken up. The temple was sealed twice earlier too due to differences between the two communities. A resident, who did not want to be named, said hopefully the temple would not be sealed again and people of all communities would continue to enjoy being able to worship inside the temple. Tiruvallur district Assistant Commissioner (holding additional charge) of the HR&CE portfolio K. Chitra Devi said staff members had been posted at the temple to ensure that there was no discrimination and everyone was allowed inside the temple. A police posse had been stationed at the temple to ensure peace and the situation would continue to be monitored by the local police officials, she added.

            "description": "Justice Krishnan Ramasamy dismisses writ petitions filed by Daisy Aadhav Arjuna and Suvali Real Properties LLP too",
            "content": "The Madras High Court has refused to interfere with a decision taken by the Income Tax (I-T) department to transfer the proceedings initiated against lottery baron Santiago Martin\u2019s wife Leema Rose Martin and daughter Daisy Martin Aadhav Arjuna from Coimbatore to Kolkata. Justice Krishnan Ramasamy dismissed the writ petitions filed by them as well as Suvali Real Properties LLP against a notification issued by the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax in Coimbatore on April 25, 2024 for transferring their assessment proceedings to the central circle at Kolkata. Questioning the transfer, the petitioners had contended that they do not carry any business within the jurisdiction of the Kolkata central circle and therefore, the proceedings initiated against them ought not to have been transferred without even hearing them in person. However, senior standing counsel for I-T department B. Ramaswamy told the court that the petitioners had been carrying on lottery business in Kolkata, Nagaland, Sikkim, Assam and many other North Eastern States and that the I-T department had seized several incriminating materials during the October 2023 raid. It was brought to the notice of the court that the search and seizure operation was carried out by the officers under the control of Principal Director of Income Tax (Investigation) in Kolkata and therefore the latter had made a request to the Coimbatore office to centralise the proceedings against the petitioners. On receipt of such request, the Coimbatore office issued show cause notices to the petitioners seeking explanation as to why their assessment proceedings should not be transferred. The petitioners submitted their written replies in December 2023 but did not appear in person on January 2, 2024 despite being given an opportunity. Since the petitioners did not avail of the opportunity of personal hearing, the department had gone ahead and transferred the proceedings to Kolkata after rejecting the objections raised by them, to such a transfer, in the written replies submitted to the show cause notices, Mr. Ramaswamy told the court. After recording his submissions, Justice Ramasamy said the petitioners appeared to have objected to the transfer by citing various reasons including their inability to travel frequently to Kolkata since it would affect their personal and official commitments and the higher cost of litigation over there. He said though the petitioners had their registered office in Coimbatore, they appeared to have a place of business, directly or indirectly, in Kolkata too. Further, the seizure of the incriminating documents, linking the petitioners with the lottery business, had been made only by the Kolkata central circle. Therefore, it would only be appropriate for the Kolkata central circle to continue the assessment proceedings, irrespective of the location of the petitioners\u2019 registered office, the judge said. He also said the I-T sleuths in Coimbatore may not be able to deal with the issue effectively when the seizures had been made in Kolkata.

            "content": "The Supreme Court will examine on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) suggestions from petitioners seeking relief from States bulldozing homes and private properties of undertrials, and frame pan-India guidelines. A Bench headed by Justice B.R. Gavai had made it clear that the law did not permit retributory demolition of the properties of accused, who were still awaiting trial, or their immediate families. \u201c How can anybody\u2019s home be demolished because he is an accused in a case? The law does not permit that... Can it happen even if a person is a convict?\u201d Justice Gavai had orally remarked during a hearing on September 2. The court had invited suggestions from the petitioners for framing uniform guidelines against illegal demolitions. Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, the main petitioner, has suggested prior notice at least 45 to 60 days in advance of a demolition specifying the legal provisions under which the property would be razed and attaching personal liability on officers who violate the law through arbitrary action. The petitioner sought immediate and comprehensive relief, restitution and compensation to persons and their families whose homes have been bulldozed. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the petitioner along with senior advocate C.U. Singh, had in the previous hearing urged the court to make a statement that \u201cbulldozer justice will not be meted out anywhere in the country\u201d through its guidelines. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Uttar Pradesh government, had countered that municipal laws provide for the demolition of illegal structures. Mr. Mehta had denied targeted, communal or retributive demolitions by States. On September 12, another Bench of the apex court led by Justice Hrishikesh Roy had held that the alleged involvement of a person in a crime was not a ground for the demolition of his or her property. The verdict had made it clear that authorities could not run a bulldozer over the laws of the land and the court would not remain \u201coblivious to such demolition threats inconceivable in a nation where law is supreme\u201d.

SHAIKMOHIDEEN Members of Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Programme members on Monday submitted a petition to Collector K.P. Karthikeyan to highlight their demands including jobs permanency and pay hike. The petitioners said their working hours should be fixed at 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. after which no meetings, including videoconferences, should be conducted. The meetings on holidays and sending messages through social media platforms after 6 p.m. should be strictly avoided. Conducting of meetings at headquarters after 6 p.m. should be stopped. Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Programme members should not be forced to do the duties assigned to other departments, and the maintenance of breakfast scheme records should be allotted to the Deputy Block Development Officer (Nutritious Meal Scheme). All vacancies in the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Programme should be filled up, the petitioners said. Tirunelveli district secretary of Coordination Committee of Tamil Nadu All Farmers\u2019 Associations D. Abraham of Kaanaarpatti under Maanur union submitted a petition urging the State Government to either give permission to farmers to hunt down crop-raiding wild boars or instruct the forest personnel to do the job. \u201cEven though the farmers are clamouring for removal of wild boars from the Scheduled List of Wild Animals for the past several years, the government, especially the Ministry of Forests is not prepared to fulfil the demand. Even after neighbouring Kerala removed the animal from the list to protect its farmers, the Tamil Nadu Government is in no mood to fulfil the genuine demand of agriculturists. It is so depressing and this silence is disturbing,\u201d said Mr. Abraham in his petition. On behalf of Tirunelveli Driving School Association, its members submitted a petition to the Collector seeking his intervention to rectify the \u201cirregularities\u201d in the Regional Transport Office on the issue of driving learners\u2019 licence and driving licence2, among others.

            "content": "With Namma Metro struggling with overcrowding due to a shortage of train sets, a similar issue is now affecting South Western Railway. Commuters, particularly those travelling on the busy routes between Whitefield and Hosur, are facing significant challenges due to a shortage of Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) rakes. This shortage has prevented SWR from running additional trains during peak hours. Despite the implementation of automatic signalling on the Whitefield-Hosur route, SWR has been unable to meet the rising demand for MEMU services, especially on the Bengaluru Cantonment-Whitefield stretch. The shortage has also impacted other routes, including Tumakuru, Hassan, and Hosur. Commuters, who depend heavily on these services, are now calling for urgent action to alleviate the growing congestion. \u201cThere is a shortage of MEMU rakes, and the Bengaluru division has already requested additional trains from the Railway Board. The line capacity utilisation on the Bengaluru Cantonment-Whitefield section is already over 100%, and while quadrupling work is in progress, the situation remains tight. Similarly, doubling work is ongoing on the Hosur route,\u201d a senior SWR official explained. This shortage has resulted in packed trains, longer waits and frustration among commuters, who are hoping for a swift resolution. For many, additional trains are not just a convenience but a necessity. \u201cWe need more trains, especially during peak hours. The current services are overcrowded, and at times, it is impossible even to board. With more trains, we can have a safer and more comfortable commute,\u201d said Harish Ramnath, a commuter from Hosur. Another commuter, Priya R., who works in Whitefield, shared her concerns. \u201cThe trains are packed, particularly in the evenings. If more MEMU trains are added, travel will be less stressful. It would also ease the burden on other forms of transport. Even the metro is overcrowded due to a shortage of train coaches.\u201d Rajesh K. Rao, who travels from Bengaluru Cantonment to Whitefield, added: \u201cIf we had more frequent trains, it would encourage more people to use public transport instead of private vehicles. This would reduce both traffic congestion and pollution in the city. The current situation is unbearable, and more trains would make a significant difference.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 09:16 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

A bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice J. Sreenivas Rao , however, granted liberty to the petitioner to approach the civil court concerned to ascertain their claims over the land. Three years ago, Sagi Hanumantha Rao of Burugupalli village in Gangadhara mandal of Karimnagar district filed a writ petition seeking a direction to Revenue authorities to correct land records pertaining to them. Mr. Rao\u2019s mother purchased lands admeasuring 64.30 acres in Kondaipally of the same mandal in 1963 and applied for mutation of the entire land on her name. In 2019, she realised that five acres of the total land were not mutated on her name and approached the Revenue authorities. The Special Tribunal of Karimnagar dismissed her appeal to rectify the land records. Challenging this, her son moved the HC in 2021. The single judge dismissed the petition observing that \u201cthere cannot be any hesitation to hold that the appeal is hopelessly barred by limitation\u201d stating that it was filed after 57 years. The Division Bench headed by the CJ, upholding the single judge verdict, noted that parties were not entitled to seek correction of revenue entries after long lapse of time. \u201cParties have to approach the authorities within a reasonable period, though the statute has not prescribed any time limit,\u201d the Bench said.

            "content": "While collecting the Land Pooling Scheme consent agreements from farmers at Penumaka Village in Amaravati capital region on Monday, the Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Ponguru Narayana assured that the government would take pro-farmer decisions as they have been sacrificing their lands for the construction of the capital city for the State. Meka Venkata Reddy, Kallam Anitha, Meka Subba Reddy and Meka Lakshma Reddy gave their lands to an extent of 7.2 acres to the APCRDA under the LPS to the Minister at their houses. With an intention to give confidence among farmers, who are giving lands under the LPS, the Minister himself visited the houses of them and collected the consent documents. On this occasion, he answered the doubts and questions of the farmers. Despite the APCRDA pooled more than 30,000 acres between 2014 and 2015 from the farmers in Amaravati capital city, still about 3,000 acres need to be collected. As the previous YSRCP did not wish to develop the Amaravati capital city, it did not collect the remaining lands. Hence the present NDA government has again started this exercise. Mr. Narayana said that after completing the LPS, the government would go for land acquisition if required.

Assistant Sub-Inspector Nabhiraj Dayannavar suffered head injury when a rod from a flyover under construction in Hubballi fell on his head when he was driving to work on September 10. He died in the Karnataka Medical College and Research Institute (KMCRI) on Sunday. Following his death, the officer\u2019s son, Vrushabh, filed a complaint. The complaint accused the agency of negligence and failure to take safety measures. The police officers registered a case against 19 people, including directors of the construction company, and its employees. The arrested people include engineers, supervisor, crane operator, labour and a labour contractor. Some of the names were given as engineers Jitendrapal Sharma and Bhupendar Pal, supervisor Harsha Hosaganiger and labour contractor Mohammad Rabiulhak. More arrests may follow, the police said. Investigators found that the city-based office of the company was closed. Work on the flyover has been stopped temporarily. The Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad has asked senior officers to submit a report on the safety measures being taken at the construction site and other details.

            "content": "Senior doctors of R.G. Kar Medical College on Monday (September 16, 2024) alleged tampering of evidence in the Kolkata doctor rape and murder case. Addressing a press conference here, they reiterated their demand for a live streaming of the meeting between them and the West Bengal government. \u201cWe condemn all such heinous crimes. This crime is a fallout of the nexus between the West Bengal government and health department officials,\u201d said one of the doctors. The doctors alleged there was \u201ctampering of evidence\u201d. In a statement, the doctors have demanded that they want concerned authorities, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Supreme Court to expedite the investigation process and punish the culprits without any delay. Remove the director medical education (DME), director health services (DHS) and health secretary as their signatures are present in the order for construction work in the immediate auspices of the crime scene, when it should have been completely cordoned off, they demanded in the statement. The doctors have also demanded the removal of Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goel for his administrative failure and evidence tampering, disciplinary action against deputy commissioner (north) for his incompetence and offering money to the victim\u2019s parents, and deputy commissioner (central) for trying to hide the identity of a suspected person present inside the crime scene. They demanded proper security and functional basic amenities in all hospitals and government healthcare centres. Their fifth demand was to end threat culture prevalent in all facets of government healthcare facilities. In the statement, the doctors have stated that numerous attempts have been made to politically exploit their movement but have been successfully defied from their side. They said many false narratives and rumours have been spread regarding their movement but could never dampen their spirit. They stand firm, rooted to their cause in finding justice despite all threats posed at them and their movement, they added. The doctors are presently sitting in front of Swasthyo Bhavan for the last six days to make the state government fulfil their demands, it said. \u201cWe were looking forward to have a hopefully fruitful meeting with our CM to end this deadlock but two such attempts have failed on the ground of transparency. We have also mailed to the President of India as constitutional head of the country to address the current situation and our five-point demands. \u201cWe are patiently waiting for the next Supreme Court hearing on Tuesday (September 17, 2024). We appeal to the entire nation to join this protest for the retrieval of humanity. We implore everybody to resonate with our five-point demands of justice for Abhaya,\u201d the statement added. The West Bengal government on Monday (September 16, 2024) \u201cfor the fifth and the final time\u201d invited the protesting junior doctors for talks to end the R.G. Kar impasse, two days after the dialogue failed to take off over disagreement on live streaming of the meeting. In an email to the protesting junior doctors, Chief Secretary Manoj Pant asked them to reach Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee\u2019s residence in Kalighat at 5 p.m. on Monday (September 16, 2024) for the talks.

            "description": "Economists cite oil sliding below $70 as offering a strong case for a fuel price cut; stress that cheaper fuel will also help slow the pace of inflation and boost consumption",
            "content": "With global crude oil prices slipping below $70 a barrel, economists reckon there is a strong case for a fuel price cut for Indian consumers, stressing that cheaper petrol and diesel would also help slow inflation, paving the way for interest rate cuts, and boost consumption. While fuel prices are deregulated in India with oil marketing companies (OMCs) free to reset prices, in practice, prices have not been reset in line with supply price trends for a few years now. Retail prices for petroleum products have been static since March, when they were reduced by \u20b92 a litre ahead of the general election. \u201cWe believe that there is a strong case for another cut in fuel prices possibly by \u20b92 to \u20b94 per litre if global crude prices continue to remain below $75 per barrel over the next one-two months,\u201d averred Suman Chowdhury, executive director and chief economist at Acuite\u0301 Ratings & Research. \u201cThe decision on the price cut may also be influenced by the upcoming State elections in Maharashtra and Haryana,\u201d he added. \u201cGiven that India imports around 87% of its crude oil requirements, any significant price reduction always augurs well for the economy,\u201d he said, adding that OMCs\u2019 margins had risen notably in the current quarter. Bank of Baroda chief economist Madan Sabnavis said that softening oil prices would help control India\u2019s import bill and stabilise the rupee, but the impact on retail inflation would depend on government action. \u201cThe products where prices are driven by market like ATF should move downwards. However, fuel prices at the petrol pumps will depend on whether the Centre and States decide to pass on the benefit,\u201d he noted. Even if retail fuel prices remained unchanged, Mr. Sabnavis underlined that wholesale price inflation would face downward pressure if oil prices stayed in the $70-$75 range, while the government would see a lower subsidy bill on LPG and fertilisers. While there were concerns about the implication of the fundamentals driving the dip in oil prices, such as a slowing global economy, Mr. Chowdhury said if the fuel price cuts materialised, they would support the expected downtrend in the headline inflation trajectory, which already had the \u2018tailwinds of a good monsoon\u2019. \u201cIt may further put pressure on RBI to opt for a rate cut in December. Lower inflation along with a cut in interest rates is likely to strengthen consumption demand and overall economic growth,\u201d the Acuite\u0301 economist emphasised. Some manufacturing sectors would also see better margins, while domestic airlines could get some relief due to lower ATF prices, he noted. Further, manufacturing sectors that have a significant dependence on crude oil derivatives were also expected to see an improvement in margins in the near term. Some of these sectors, where volume growth has been relatively low, may also opt to improve the latter by passing on some of the benefits to the consumers. The transport sectors including domestic airline companies were also set to get relief due to lower ATF prices.

            "content": "Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK) party functionaries from Madurai and the southern districts staged a massive protest and attempted to block the Kappalur toll plaza in Tirumangalam in Madurai district on Monday. Hundreds of party functionaries who were present demanded the closure of the toll plaza. Condemning the Central government, the party cadre raised slogans and demanded the toll plaza to be removed. They said that the people were affected by the increase in the toll fee and urged for reduction of the fee. This will be a burden on the common man as it will raise the cost of transportation and prices of the essential commodities will increase as a result, the party members said. They said that in Tamil Nadu there were around 70 National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) toll plazas and more have been announced. Even in the toll plazas where the agreement period has expired toll fees were being collected from vehicle users, instead of closing the toll plaza. Condemning this, they said that protests were held by the party cadres across various places in Tamil Nadu. Crores of rupees were being collected in the name of toll on a daily basis and every year the toll fees were being hiked. The people were being looted as they have to pay the toll fees, apart from the tax, they said. They said that some of the toll plazas in the State even lack basic infrastructure facilities. New toll plazas should not be opened in Tamil Nadu, they said. The protests were led by party functionaries S. Mydeen Sait Khan, S. Sheik Ibrahim, Kader Mydeen, Palani Faruk and others. The party cadre attempted to block the toll plaza following the protest. However, the police personnel who were deployed in large numbers at the toll plaza apprehended the party functionaries. They were detained by the police. This is not the first time a massive protest has been staged at the Kappalur toll plaza. Only recently, the residents of Tirumangalam and neighbouring areas had staged a protest demanding the authorities concerned to withdraw an order of collecting 50% toll fee for local vehicles. The residents said that they should be exempted from the toll. The residents too have demanded the removal of the toll plaza. They said that the Kappalur Toll Plaza violated the rules. The minimum distance between two toll plazas should be 60 km. But, the distance between the toll plazas at Kappalur and Chittampatti near Melur is only 48 km, they had pointed out.

            "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a new Vande Bharat Express between Pune and Hubballi via video link on Monday. He also flagged off six other trains and laid the foundation for some railway works. Minister of State for Railways V. Somanna was present at a ceremony in Kolhapur in Maharashtra, along with railway officials. Mr. Somanna told reporters that he will strive to get another Vande Bharat for Karnataka. He said that the new Vande Bharat services between Pune and SSS Hubballi and Kolhapur and Pune mark significant progress in rail connectivity for both Karnataka and Maharashtra.

Chandrababu Naidu government in the State was committed to the demand for operationalisation of the railway zone (Visakhapatnam-head quartered South Coast Railway (S Co R) zone). He said that the State government has already handed over the land for construction of the zonal headquarters and the bhoomi puja for construction of the zonal headquarter would be performed on an auspicious day between Dasara and Deepavali. He expressed optimism that the new Vande Bharat express would contribute to the growth and development of the backward districts of North Andhra as also Rayagada in Odisha and Raipur and Durg in Chhattisgarh. He complimented the Prime Minister for launching several initiatives like \u2018Make in India\u2019. Today, state-of-the art coaches were being made in India with indigenous technical know-how and our own human resources, he added. The railway stations, which were constructed during the British time, about a century ago, were now being upgraded. High speed and semi-high speed trains like Vande Bharat were launched after Mr. Modi became the Prime Minister. In future, Vande Bharat sleeper trains would be introduced. He also said that Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw was competing with the Civil Aviation Ministry by improving railway infrastructure and capacity. Visakhapatnam MP M. Sribharat, Rajya Sabha Member Golla Babu Rao, Mayor G. Hari Venkata Kumari, MLAs P.G.V.R. Naidu, P.

            "description": "The man, identified by law enforcement officials as Ryan Wesley Routh, was to face a federal magistrate in West Palm Beach. Shackled and wearing a blue jumpsuit, Routh smiled as he spoke with his lawyer and reviewed documents ahead of his initial appearance",
            "content": "A man suspected in an apparent assassination attempt targeting former President Donald Trump was charged Monday (September 16, 2024) with federal gun crimes, making his first court appearance in the final weeks of a White House race already touched by violence. Ryan Wesley Routh , 58, faces charges of possessing a firearm despite being a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Additional and more serious charges are possible as the investigation continues and prosecutors seek an indictment from a grand jury. Routh appeared briefly in federal court in West Palm Beach, where he answered perfunctory questions about his work status and income. Shackled and wearing a blue jumpsuit, he smiled as he spoke with a public defender and reviewed documents ahead of his initial appearance. The lawyer declined to comment after the court appearance. The episode occurred Sunday (September 15, 2024) afternoon when Secret Service agents stationed a few holes up from where Mr. Trump was playing golf noticed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle sticking through the shrubbery that lines the course, roughly 400 yards away. An agent fired and Routh dropped the rifle and fled in an SUV, leaving the firearm behind along with two backpacks, a scope used for aiming and a GoPro camera, authorities said. Routh was later stopped by law enforcement in a neighbouring county. It was the second apparent assassination attempt targeting Mr. Trump in as many months. On July 13, a bullet grazed Mr. Trump\u2019s ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania . Eight days later, Democratic President Joe Biden withdrew from the race , giving way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the party\u2019s nominee.

            "content": "The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has now digitised about 21 lakh property records in the city to implement a faceless, contactless online e-khata issuance system. Portions of it will be made public, allowing property owners to check the records online and get an e-khata soon. Now, property records are maintained manually in over 5,500 ledgers. Digitisation began in 2023 after directions from Bengaluru Development Minister D.K. Shivakumar. The exercise aims to reduce red tape and corruption over issuing khata, but at the same time also increase property tax revenue. The agency tasked with digitising records has finished the work. However, records of only 700 ledgers have been checked. The BBMP is conducting multi-level quality checks of the digitized records involving case workers, Deputy Commissioners, and Joint Commissioners. At each level, authorized personnel randomly select records to verify their accuracy. If discrepancies are found, the entire ledger is revised. The civic body plans to roll out the digitized property records of the 700 ledgers soon after integrating corresponding data from Kaveri 2, the database of the Department of Stamps and Registration. Once the system is launched, property owners will need to enter their names, complete an online KYC, and upload sale deeds of their properties (which can be fetched online from the Kaveri 2 database) to download an e-khata. Before the system goes live, the public will have a 7- to 15-day window to file objections. \u201cThere are over 2.1 million properties in the city. We have digitised the records of 21 lakh properties, with approximately 50,000 remaining. All properties from the 5,500 record books have been digitised. This system will bring transparency as owners won\u2019t need to meet revenue officials for e-khatas. It is also expected to boost property tax revenue,\u201d a senior civic official stated.

            "content": "The police and the Motor Vehicles department are planning a crackdown on private bus staff in Kozhikode to check drug abuse among them. Several incidents of violence among private bus staff were reported recently in the city and drug abuse has been identified as the primary reason for the violent behaviour. A couple of weeks ago, a private bus driver was attacked using a jack lever by another bus driver during an altercation at the mofussil bus stand in Kozhikode over time slots assigned to their buses. \u201cThere is less than a five-minute difference between buses plying in the same route. A slight delay by one may affect patronage in another. This often results in competition between the buses, rash driving and sometimes accidents,\u201d said G. Gopakumar, Station House Officer at Kasaba police station. Rampant use of drugs by bus drivers has also been reported, putting passengers at risk. \u201cThe drug abuse is affecting their cognitive abilities, adding to their criminal mentality, resulting in rash behaviour,\u201d said Mr. Gopakumar. The Kasaba police had convened a meeting of bus owners and trade unions to discuss the issue. The police have said that stringent action will be taken against bus drivers if they were found with drugs. \u201cPossession of drugs is a non-bailable offence. If these drivers or cleaners are found guilty in one case, they cannot rejoin duty without furnishing an affidavit before the Regional Transport Officer. Repeated offenders may lose their licence,\u201d said Mr. Gopakumar. He said the police, with the help of the MVD, was planning to conduct inspections at bus stands to check the use of drugs among the bus staff.

Fareed and Mr. Khader. All people of Bajal should live happily by developing mutual trust and cooperation. Religious scholar Sayed K.S. Attakoya Thangal Kumbol said that mosques have their own discipline and respect. They should be followed. He said that masjids should not become venue for discussing unrelated matters. They are the venues to offer mass namaz (prayer) and chapters of the Koran. They should be done regularly. Yenepoya Abdullah Kunhi, Chancellor, Yenepoya Deemed to be University, said that the renovated masjid should not become the venue for offering only Friday prayer. Instead, namaz should be offered daily five times at the masjid. Councillor of Mangaluru City Corporation and president of the renovated masjid Abdul Rauf presided over.

            "description": "Kerala State Electricity Board estimates \u20b942,800 crore investment needed to add 7,750 MW capacity by 2030. In 2023-24, the State\u2019s installed capacity \u2013 KSEB units and other sources combined \u2013 stood at 3,419 MW.",
            "content": "Augmenting Kerala\u2019s internal power generation capability is not going to come cheap, if a Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) estimate is any indication. The power-deficit State, which has seen a sharp increase in electricity demand in recent years, will need an investment of about \u20b942,800 crore for adding 7,750 megawatts (MW) to its installed capacity for power generation, according to the state-run power utility. The KSEB estimate gains significance in the context of a plan to raise the capacity to 10,000 MW by 2030. The investment projections are tied to per-MW costs for establishing hydropower, wind, solar and pumped storage projects (PSP) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). KSEB chairman and managing director Biju Prabhakar presented the estimates at a public hearing held by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission last week on proposals for revising the electricity tariffs. In 2023-24, the State\u2019s installed capacity \u2013 KSEB units and other sources combined \u2013 stood at 3,419 MW. Mr. Prabhakar\u2019s presentation at the hearing covered \u201cimmediate investments needed\u201d spanning different power sources, including those in the KSEB wish list such as BESS and offshore wind energy, for adding another 7,750 MW. The KSEB estimate calls for an investment of \u20b912,000 crore each for adding 1,500 MW through hydropower projects and 2,000 MW through PSPs. In wind energy, 370 MW can be added in onshore projects at \u20b92,200 crore, 50 MW through offshore wind projects at an estimated \u20b9800 crore, and 30 MW via vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) projects with an investment of \u20b9300 crore. Ground/floating solar projects will require an investment of \u20b92,500 crore for adding 500 MW, while 3,300-MW BESS projects will require \u20b913,000 crore. Cost per MW The per-MW cost of establishing the projects vary for the power sources, ranging from \u20b94 crore per MW for BESS projects to \u20b9 15 crore-\u20b917 crore/MW for offshore wind projects. For hydel projects, the mainstay of Kerala\u2019s internal power generation, it is estimated at \u20b96 crore to \u20b98 crore per MW. Current capacity accounts for only about 30% of Kerala\u2019s electricity requirement. The spending on power purchases to fill the demand-supply gap rose from \u20b97,393 crore in 2016-17 to \u20b911,241 crore in 2022-23 and \u20b912,983 crore in 2023-24, according to the KSEB. Kerala has been eyeing Central assistance for increasing is power generation capacity. For instance, KSEB proposes to implement BESS projects in eight locations with viability gap funding (VGF) from the Centre. VGF of up to 40% is available under a central scheme if the project gets approved before March 31, 2026.

            "content": "A new organization, the Progressive Film Makers, is launched in response to the Hema Committee report revealing widespread misconduct in the Malayalam film industry. Kochi: The repercussions of the Justice Hema Committee report, which brought out the ugly side of the Malayalam film world and the untold miseries of the women in it, continue to shake the industry with a group of film personalities on Monday announcing their decision to start a new organisation, as the existing Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) and the Film Employees Federation of Kerala (FEFKA) have come under a cloud. Named the Progressive Film Makers, the new organisation has Aashiq Abu, his actress wife Rima Kallingal, and popular directors Anjali Menon, Lijo Jose Perilassery, and Rajiv Ravi, among others, behind it. Following the Hema Committee report's revelations, several former actresses broke their silence and made allegations of sexual harassment against top figures, including those holding posts in the AMMA and the FEFKA, the apex body of 21 different organisations from light boys to directors, forcing their resignations while both groups also faced flak. The entire 17-member AMMA executive, led by its recently-elected President, superstar Mohanlal, resigned. Abu, in turn, resigned from the FEFKA accusing its General Secretary B.Unnikrishnan of not reacting to the Hema Committee report on time. Following the allegations, 11 FIRs were registered and those now who are facing the music include actor-turned-CPI-M legislator Mukesh Madhavan, Nivin Pauly, Siddique, Jayasurya, Edavela Babu, Maniyanpilla Raju, directors Ranjith and Prakash, and production executives Vichu and Noble. However, Mukesh, Ranjith, Prakash and Raju have, by now, secured relief from the court. With Abu taking the lead in floating a new outfit in the Malayalam film industry, it could see people who are not happy with the AMMA and the FEFKA joining it. Abu and his new team have by now started to reach out to all in the industry with a letter stating the reason why they decided to start a new outfit is to ensure that a new culture is built which will have equality and respectability besides a social objective. The coming days will reveal if Abu and his team are going to be successful as the Kerala High Court has slammed the Pinarayi Vijayan government for sitting on the Hema Committee report for nearly five years and has asked the special investigation team of the Kerala Police to do a clean probe based on the revelations.",

            "content": "Senior Congress leader and former Union Minister P. Chidambaram on Monday hit out at the BJP government in Haryana, terming its tenure a \u201ctotal failure\u201d that has rendered the State\u2019s economic indicators among the worst in the country. \u201cHaryana is essentially an agricultural State as more than 70% of its population earns its livelihood from this sector. Due to the callous attitude of this government, farmers had to resort to agitations and come on the roads. The BJP regime has been a complete failure,\u201d said Mr. Chidambaram, addressing a press conference in Chandigarh. The leader said the BJP government, instead of addressing farmer\u2019s problems, unleashed repression and violence against them. \u201cMore than 250 FIRs were registered against farmers, some of these were for crimes they never committed. This amply proved that suppression of democratic rights is a character of the BJP and this anti-democratic attitude is the same as that of the Central government. Farmers will never get justice from the BJP and the best way to punish it is by throwing it out of power,\u201d he said. Mr. Chidambaram blamed the BJP government for failing to address unemployment in the State during its decade-long tenure. \u201cHaryana has the worst unemployment figures in the country. As per CMIE data, its unemployment rate is 37.4%. Even the government\u2019s own labour survey report has given the figures of Haryana\u2019s unemployment as 9% as against the national average of 4.1%. This proves that unemployment in Haryana is more than double of the national average. Haryana had 4.5 lakh regular government posts out of which 1.8 lakh are vacant,\u201d he said. The former Minister said Haryana\u2019s economy is in complete shambles. \u201cIt is caught in a debt trap as it is borrowing far more than its known sources of income. Haryana had a total debt of \u20b971,000 crore in the year 2014-15 which has skyrocketed to \u20b93.79 lakh crores in the current fiscal year, a whopping increase of 348%,\u201d he said Responding to questions of rift within the party, Mr. Chidambaram denied that the Haryana Congress was a divided house. \u201cIn every State there are a few leaders who consider themselves front-runners and there is nothing wrong with it as it encourages healthy competition,\u201d he said. Asked if the Congress will announce a Chief Ministerial candidate, the leader said, \u201cCongress usually doesn\u2019t do that. The general process is that after elections, MLAs are asked about their preference and on the basis of that high command takes the final decision.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 08:52 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit A litmus test for the BJP in Haryana Haryana / Haryana Assembly Elections 2024 / Bharatiya Janata Party",

            "content": "VHP and Bajrang Dal activists gather in large numbers on B.C. Road to block the Id procession, near Bantwal, on Monday. The police placed barricades and dispersed the activists.| Photo Credit:SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT Tension prevailed for a while on B.C. Road on Monday, September 16, when a large number of people took part in the annual Id procession, while at the same time, many Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) activists gathered in the town following a voice message in social media which challenged to stop the procession. The voice message circulated earlier went viral in social media. Following a recent statement by VHP\u2019s South Karnataka Joint Secretary Sharan Pumpwell during a public Ganesha festival function in Mangaluru that VHP activists can block procession of Muslims, a voice message reportedly by a former Bantwal Town Municipal Council president Mohammed Sharief challenging the activists to block the Id procession on B.C. Road went viral on social media. The Bantwal Town Police filed a case against Sharief in this connection. In response, activists of VHP and its affiliated units including Bajarang Dal, including Mr. Pumpwell, from across Dakshina Kannada, assembled in large numbers at Rakteshwari Daivastana on B.C. Road. Meanwhile, devout Muslims took out the Id procession from B.C. Road Junction to Mittabail Masjid. When Mr. Pumpwell and other activists began to march from the daivasthana towards B.C. Road junction, the police prevented them by placing barricades. Meanwhile, the Id procession ended at the masjid around noon. As police started to disperse VHP activists, the situation flared up when VHP activists saw some youths moving on two-wheelers and flashing some flags. The police convinced VHP activists to leave the place and brought the situation under control. Earlier, on Sunday, Y. Bharath Shetty, Mangaluru City North MLA, expressed apprehension over the misuse of Id procession for creating unrest and had asked police to ban Id processions. Criticising the conduct of Dr. Shetty, DYFI State president Muneer Katipalla said in a statement on Monday that instead of acting as an MLA and ensuring peaceful conduct of the Id procession, Dr. Shetty turned out as the hater of a community. Dr. Shetty has done little development work, but takes every opportunity to spread hatred between communities and reap political benefit out of it, Mr. Katipalla alleged. Ignoring the campaign against Id procession, people in some other parts near Mangaluru distributed sweets and juice to devout Muslims who took part in the Id procession in places like Mani and Anantady. \u201cThe elected representatives should learn from these villagers. These villagers have given a befitting reply to (Mangaluru City) MLAs and VHP activists,\u201d Mr. Katipalla said.

            "content": "Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) Sirsa candidate Rohtash Jangra on Monday (September 16, 2024) withdrew his nomination papers in support of Haryana Lokhit Party\u2019s (HLP) Gopal Kanda. Later, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) secretary-general Abhay Chautala said that he would reconsider his alliance with the HLP. Haryana is going to polls on October 5 and the vote counting will take place on October 8. Mr. Kanda, who supported the BJP during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, had joined INLD-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance a day after the BJP released its final list of candidates which didn\u2019t feature his name. BJP senior leader Ashok Tanwar, at a press conference, announced that the party\u2019s candidate from Sirsa assembly constituency had withdrawn his papers and extended support to Mr. Kanda. Mr. Tanwar said that the party supported Mr. Kanda as he had supported the BJP during the Lok Sabha polls. On why the party earlier ruled out alliance with the HLP, Mr. Tanwar said that \u201cit was the decision of the high command\u201d. Despite Chief Minister Nayab Saini hinting last month that the BJP would tie up with the HLP, the saffron party in its final list fielded Mr. Jangra from Sirsa. A day later, Mr. Kanda joined the INLD-BSP alliance. However following the BJP\u2019s U-turn on alliance with the HLP, INLD leader Mr. Chautala, at a press conference, said he would speak to Mr. Kanda about this and reconsider his decision to ally with him. \u201cIf the BJP has supported Mr. Kanda and he has accepted their support, we would discuss it to decide on the future course of action,\u201d said Mr. Chautala. Recently a video clip went viral, in which Mr. Kanda told a news channel that the BJP would form government for a third time in Haryana and the INLD-led alliance would support it. On the BJP supporting Mr. Kanda, former Chief Minister and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, at a press conference, said the people of the State already knew this would happen. \u201cINLD-HLP earlier had an indirect alliance with the BJP, but it has now become public,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Haryana, the direct contest is between the Congress and BJP. All other parties like INLD, Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), HLP have been fielded only to split the votes of the Congress. The BJP has given this responsibility to many Independents also. The public needs to be cautious of such candidates,\u201d Mr. Hooda said.

            "content": "The Excise department in Kottayam has once again uncovered a major haul of black money from an interstate bus. According to officials, \u20b967 lakh was seized from two separate locations within the same bus, which was operating from Bengaluru to Erumely on Monday. One individual has been taken into custody in connection with the incident. Of the total amount, \u20b944 lakh was confiscated near Erattupetta, while \u20b923 lakh was found at Ponkunnam. The first seizure occurred in the morning when the Excise team inspected the bus near Erattupetta, while another team intercepted it at Ponkunnam, leading to the second discovery. This follows a similar operation just last week when Excise officials confiscated nearly \u20b91 crore during a search at Thalayolaparambu, resulting in the arrest of a Pathanapuram native. The investigation in that case is currently being handled by the Thalayolaparambu police. Taking a serious note of the development, the district police are intensifying efforts to crack down on the increasing inflow of black money into the region.

            "content": "Citing delay in the progress of trial, the High Court of Karnataka has granted bail to four more accused persons in the Gauri Lankesh murder case. The editor-activist was shot dead at her residence on September 5, 2017. Those who were granted bail are Bharat Jayawant Kurane, 42, Sudhanva Gondhalekar, 43, Sujith Kumar, 42, and Srikanth Pangarkar, 48, who have been arraigned as accused number 6, 9, 13, and 16 respectively in the charge sheet. Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order while allowing separate petitions filed by the four accused while granting them bail on similar grounds of delay in progress of trial on which the four other accused persons (accused number 5,7,11 and 17) were given bail earlier. \u201cUndisputedly, petitioners herein were not present at the spot of crime on the date of incident. Accused number 2 [Parashuram Wagmore] and 3 [Ganesh Maskin] are the alleged assailants of deceased Gauri Lankesh. The allegation against the petitioners is about conspiring with the other accused persons and also facilitating the commission of crime by arranging vehicles, fire arms, etc. Almost similar allegations are found even against accused number 5, 7, 11 and 17, who have been granted regular bail by this court,\u201d the judge observed. Totally 18 persons, who were arraigned as accused in the chargesheet, are facing trial in the case. Also, the court noted that the apex court had on August 20, 2024 dismissed the petitions filed by the State government questioning the High Court\u2019s December 2023 order of granting bail to N. Mohan Nayak (accused number 11) on the ground of delay in progress of the trial. 100 more witnesses The apex court had recorded the statement made on behalf of the State government that \u201c... so far 137 witnesses have been examined by the prosecution, 137 witnesses have been dropped and the prosecution is also likely to drop 150 more witnesses, and now about 100 witnesses are still to be examined.\u201d While noticing that accused Mohan Nayak had cooperated for trial and had not sought adjournment, the apex court had directed the trial court to expedite the case and asked all the parties to cooperate. However, the apex court gave liberty to the prosecution to seek cancellation of his bail if he violated any conditions of the bail or failed to cooperate for further trial and sought unnecessary adjournments.

            "content": "A Bengaluru-based body of pensioners under the Employees\u2019 Pension Scheme (EPS)-1995 of the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has renewed its call for calculating the value of pension wealth under the Scheme on the lines of the National Pension System (NPS) and fixing 8% rate of interest to the Pension Scheme. In a response to an item appeared in FAQ columns on EPFO pensioners on Sunday (September 15) , the ITI Retired Officers Association (IRIROA) stated that even though the EPS was similar to the NPS in terms of being a contributory scheme, the pension amount was being calculated based on \u201cfixed pensionable salary,\u201d and not on the basis of accumulated pension fund that was being followed in respect of the NPS. Giving illustrations, the body pointed out that as per the present EPS-95 Scheme, the maximum pension a retiree would, under normal circumstances, get for 35 years of service was \u20b97,500/- per month or \u20b990,000 per annum. This worked out to 3.06% return on the member\u2019s accumulated pension fund. Similarly, for 25 and 30 years, the monthly pension amounts would be \u20b95,357 (5.14%) and \u20b96,428 (3.98%) respectively. Advocating the determination of 8% rate of return (RoR) on accumulated pension, the pensioners\u2019 body argued that the existing rate of return, expressed as a percentage of pension payable, was \u201cvery much lower\u201d than that of banks. If 8% RoR was taken, the monthly pension would have been \u20b98,329, \u20b912,907 and \u20b919,633 for 25, 30 and 35 years of service respectively. The ITIROA, which made certain suggestions in a representation sent a couple of months ago to the Prime Minister and Union Ministers for Finance and Labour and Employment, also wanted the facility of commutation to be provided to the pension wealth in the event of any exigency for the pensioner.

Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy (Coal and Mines) will unfurl the national flag in the presence of his cabinet colleague Bandi Sanjay Kumar (Union Minister of State of Home) and other BJP leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP K.

The celebrations include the performance of various cultural programmes relating to the liberation struggle, parade by para-military and defence forces and finally the unfurling of the national flag by the chief guest. Union Home Minister Amit Shah was the chief guest last year but this time he is skipping the event. The party is also organising a blood donation camp as a part of \u2018Sewa MahaYagna\u2019 on the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s birthday at the Dr Shyam Prasad Mukherjee Bhavan - State office, Nampally, 11.30 a.m. onwards. All the top leaders will be attending the event. Mr. Kishan Reddy will also be unfurling the national flag at the State office earlier in the day. The State party president and Union Minister also went around the Ganesh pandals around the twin cities, including the Khairatabad one, and hailed the 11-day festivities which will be concluded tomorrow on a grand scale with the final procession of the immersion of idols. Mr. Kishan Reddy has reminded that it was former MP A. Narendra who had established the Bhagyanagar Ganesh Utsav Samithi (BGUS) and helped organise the festival successfully for many years. He urged the citizens to participate in the festivities, besides attending the Hyderabad Liberation Day event and the PM\u2019s birthday celebrations in the party office tomorrow.

            "description": "Baiju Thittala, an Arpookara native and the first non-white person to be the Mayor of Cambridge, says he will continue with the fight against far right movements that run strong campaigns targeting immigrants",
            "content": "Right from his younger days working in the paddy fields of Arpookara village in Kottayam district with his father, Baiju Thittala had a clear road map in his mind. He wanted to study law, and use it as a stepping stone to politics and become a part of the policy-making process. Though he had to give up that dream for a while, due to the social and economic reasons, he did finally follow that road map to become the Mayor of Cambridge, the first non-white person to occupy that position. Addressing a \u2018meet the press\u2019 event at the Press Club here on Monday, he spoke about his life experiences on the way to become the Mayor. \u201cInitially, I shifted base to Delhi, where I did all kinds of jobs, including the menial ones. When my wife, Ancy, a nurse, migrated to Britain, I went with her. In Britain, I worked as a part-time care assistant and studied politics, history and sociology at the Cambridge Regional College. I then studied law at the Anglia Ruskin University, qualified as a solicitor in 2019 and is now practising as a criminal defence solicitor. All through, I was active in student politics, participating in several protests. In 2007, I became a member of the Labour Party,\u201d said Mr. Thittala. First electoral victory His first electoral victory came in a by-election in 2018 to the East Chesterton seat of the Cambridge City Council. In May 2023, he became a Deputy Mayor, and finally in this May, the Mayor. He has piloted motions to support the Black Lives Matter movement and also made interventions to stop discrimination against non-EU nurses. He said that his politics is aimed at ensuring equality, social justice, and diversity. \u201cFar right movements have been running strong campaigns targeting immigrants, leading to even riot-like situations. But the government has cracked down on them and arrested hundreds of people involved in such activities. Next month, we will organise an event titled \u2018Stand up against racism\u2019 to sensitise the communities and with a stated aim to keep the far right out. In November, we will organise a commemoration event for the fallen soldiers of World War I and II to increase awareness on the number of Indians who lost their lives in these wars. These steps at spreading awareness on real history is an important political duty,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Asian Champions Trophy: India will take on hosts China in Tuesday's final. Skipper Harmanpreet Singh's sublime form resulted in twin strikes as defending champions India entered the final of the Hero Asian Champions Trophy with a clinical 4-1 win against South Korea in the semi-final on Monday. India scored through Uttam Singh (13th minute), skipper Harmanpreet Singh (19th, 45th) and Jarmanpreet Singh (32nd), while Korea's lone goal came from through Yang Jihun (33rd)'s penalty corner conversion. India will take on hosts China in Tuesday's final. Earlier in the day, China defeated Pakistan 2-0 via shoot-out in the first semifinal after the two teams finished 1-1 at the end of regulation 60 minutes. In the previous league stage encounter between the two finalists, India prevailed 3-0. Pakistan and Korea will face off in the third place classification match which will also be played on Tuesday. Meanwhile in the fifth-sixth place classification match, Japan beat Malaysia 4-2 in shoot-out following a 4-4 stalemate in normal time. In the second semifinal as expected, the Indians started on the offensive and tested the Korean defence with persistent attacks from the word go. The Koreans, on the other hand, were contend to sit back and defend and rely on sporadic counter attacks. Abhishek came tantalisingly close to handing India the lead in the fourth minute but his reverse hit was brilliantly saved by Korean goalkeeper Kim Jaehan. The Indian made promising build ups and penetrated the Korean circle on consistent basis in the first quarter. India's attacking intent finally paid of in the 13th minute when Uttam positioned himself at the right place at the right time to tap in Araijeet Singh Hundal's supply from the right. A minute from the first break, Korea secured back-to-back penalty corners but failed to utilise the chances. Four minutes into the second quarter, India secured their first penalty corner and Harmanpreet scored his sixth goal of the tournament to hand his side a 2-0 lead. At the stroke of half-time, custodian Suraj Karkera came out of his line to save an effort from the opposition player. India continued in the same vein after the change of ends and extended their lead two minutes into the third quarter. A brilliant scoop from Sumit from the right finds Jarmanpreet just outside the circle on the left flank and the latter neatly collected the ball and took a step or two to get inside the circle and slap the ball into the Korean goal to extend India's lead. But Korea pulled one back a minute later from a penalty corner through the tournament's top-scorer Yang Jihun. The goal hardly bothered the Indians as they continued their attacking game and dominated the share of exchanges. With a second left for the third quarter, India secured another penalty corner when Korean goalkeeper Jaehan was shown the yellow card for handling the ball out side the circle, and Harmanpreet made no mistake to extend the lead. Eight minutes from the final hooter, India's second goalkeeper Karkera made a fine double save to deny Park Cheoleon, but the Koreans secured a penalty corner which went in vain. Thereafter, it was controlled show from the Indians as they defended their lead with consummate ease to march into their fifth final appearance in the tournament.",

            "content": "The initial meetings between the doctors and the Chief Minister, including one on Saturday, fell through over disagreements about the proceedings being live transmitted or recorded. After two previously unsuccessful attempts, the protesting junior doctors of Kolkata have finally begun talks with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at her Kalighat residence. This is the third meeting, described by the state government as the \"fifth and final invitation for talks.\" Sources have confirmed that unlike the prior occasions, the doctors have entered the meeting space, marking the beginning of formal discussions. Earlier Attempts at Negotiation Failed The initial meetings between the doctors and the Chief Minister, including one on Saturday, fell through over disagreements about the proceedings being live transmitted or recorded. The doctors insisted that the discussions be videographed, with a copy handed to them immediately after the meeting. This led to both sides walking away from negotiations without reaching a consensus. During the first attempt, images circulated online of the Chief Minister sitting alone in a hall at the state secretariat, waiting for the doctors' delegation. These images quickly went viral, highlighting the unresolved tensions. Saturday's meeting fared no better, as arguments persisted outside Mamata Banerjee's Kalighat home. Despite her invitation for them to join her for tea, the doctors refused to enter, standing firm on their demand for live transmission. Banerjee's Attempts to Assure Doctors Go Unanswered In an effort to resolve the dispute, Mamata Banerjee personally assured the protesting doctors that they would be provided with a video recording of the meeting after the conclusion of the Supreme Court proceedings on the matter. Despite this assurance and her repeated invitations for them to enter for tea, the doctors remained adamant, stating their primary goal was not tea but justice. As time passed, the deadlock persisted. Around 9 pm on the day of the second attempt, both parties finally agreed to have a written record of the meeting signed by both sides. However, by then, it was deemed too late to proceed. The evening also saw the arrest of former RG Kar hospital principal Sandip Ghosh and a local police officer by the CBI, related to the ongoing investigation into the alleged evidence tampering following the August 9 rape-murder of a young doctor, which sparked the protests. Doctors Finally Agree To Discussions at Kalighat With the backdrop of these tense events, the protesting doctors eventually agreed to sit down for discussions at Mamata Banerjee's Kalighat residence. The Chief Minister, who had earlier stepped away to continue her work, has now rejoined the efforts to bring an end to the impasse. Both sides are expected to work towards a resolution, with hopes that the ongoing talks will finally bring the protests to a close.",

            "content": "Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday asserted that Narendra Modi-led Central government will bury terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir so deep that it can never rise again. Addressing an election rally in Jammu and Kashmir's Ramban, Shah targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying he and his sister (Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) could play with snow and ride a snowmobile because Jammu and Kashmir became a safe state under the Modi government. The government has made Kashmir safe and that is why today Rahul baba rides a bike in Kashmir and abuses Modi ji while eating ice cream at Lal Chowk, he added. Citing former home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde's statement at that time (UPA governemnt tenure) he was scared of coming to Lal Chowk, Shah called upon Shinde to visit the iconic destination in Srinagar. Shinde saheb, now come with your grand-children, take a walk in Lal Chowk, no one can touch you now, he asserted. At another BJP's rally in in Padder-Nagseni assembly segment of Kishtwar district on the last day of campaigning, Shah said the National Conference-Congress alliance will not be able to form the J-K government. \u201cToday, I promise to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, including this region which has a history of sacrifices following the eruption of terrorism in 1990, that we will bury terrorism to such a deep level that it will never surface again,\u201d the home minister said. He added that attempts are being made to revive and strengthen terrorism like the 1990s. The home minister paid tributes to all those who have been killed in terror-related incidents, and specially referred to the deaths of BJP leaders Anil Parihar, Ajit Parihar and RSS leader Chanderkant Sharma. \u201cNational Conference and Congress have made promises like releasing terrorists from jails after the formation of their government. In front of Maa (Machial Mata\u2019s) shrine, I am saying to you that this is Modi\u2019s government and no one has the courage to spread terrorism on the soil of India,\" he said. Shah said the BJP government has strengthened the village defence guards and Special Police Officers who are being provided modern weapons, replacing the old. 303 rifles with self-loading rifles. \u201cThe security grid being laid is such that any number of people (terrorists) who want to come here from anywhere will face their end in these hills at the hands of our Army and police jawans,\u201d the home minister said. This was the home minister\u2019s second visit to the Jammu region within a fortnight. Earlier, during his two-day visit to Jammu on September 6 and 7, he released BJP\u2019s manifesto for J-K assembly elections and addressed a workers convention. Monday is the last day for campaigning in 24 assembly constituencies, including Padder-Nagseni, which goes to polls in the first phase on September 18. BJP has fielded former minister Sunil Sharma from the constituency for the assembly elections. Seeking support for the BJP candidate, Shah said, \u201cThis election is between two powers, on one side National Conference and PDP and on the other BJP. The NC-Congress are saying that if we form the government we will restore Article 370. Tell me should it be restored?\u201d he asked. \u201cReservation given by BJP to Paharis and Gujjars and others will be snatched,\u201d he said. (With PTI inputs)",

            "content": "J&K Vidhansabha Chunav: A bail to Baramulla MP Er Rashid has given the National Conference a chance to corner the BJP. J&K Polls: With the voting for the Jammu and Kasmir starting on September 18, the political parties have thrown their weight behind the candidates. Star campaigners of all parties have hit the ground in the valley. While the BJP fielded only 19 candidates in the valley out of the total 47 seats, the party is looking to get support from independents and some regional parties as it's confident of winning a majority of the 43 seats in the Jammu region. A bail to Baramulla MP Er Rashid has given the National Conference a chance to corner the BJP. The NC has claimed that Er Rashid's Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) is the 'B' team of the BJP. Meanwhile, the AIP has formed an alliance with the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) for the assembly polls. There are a total of 90 seats in the J&K and the majority mark is 46. The BJP is aware that it might not get a majority on its own and thus, it has its eye on some smaller regional parties and independent candidates as well. There are seven regional parties and 32 independent candidates in the poll fray and have the potential to win the elections. According to a TOI report, the BJP has made it clear that it doesn't have a 'tacit' understanding with the UAPA detainee Er Rashid and his party AIP. The BJP leaders also claimed that the Central government vociferously opposed Rashid's bail. They also made clear that the Union government won't lift the ban from the Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir. The BJP made it clear that it won't ally with the AIP. The Union Home Minister Amit Shah has already promised that the state will get statehood at an appropriate time after the polls. The J&K is heading to polls for the first time since the abrogation of Article 370.",

            "content": "The CBI arrested Mondal on Saturday, September 14, alongside Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, where the incident took place. In the Kolkata doctor rape-murder case, Abhijit Mondal, the officer-in-charge of the Tala police station, was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for allegedly delaying the filing of the First Investigation Report (FIR) by over 14 hours. Despite his arrest, senior officials have praised Mondal for conducting a \"transparent\" investigation into the case. Officer Praised by Senior for 'Transparent' Investigation V Solomon Nesakumar, Additional Commissioner of Kolkata Police, expressed support for Mondal, emphasizing the transparency of his actions during the investigation. Nesakumar stated that the police department stands by Mondal's family and will provide full support during this difficult time. \"Personally, I believe he is not guilty. He acted with good intentions, reached the scene quickly, and conducted a thorough investigation to ensure justice was served,\" Nesakumar told reporters. Arrest Linked to Delay in FIR Filing The CBI arrested Mondal on Saturday, September 14, alongside Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, where the incident took place. Ghosh had already been in custody over alleged financial irregularities at the facility. Both are accused of delaying the FIR in the suspected rape and murder of a trainee doctor, which occurred on August 9 at RG Kar Medical College. Mondal, as the officer-in-charge of Tala police station, is alleged to have delayed registering the FIR in connection with the case, a key point of concern in the CBI's investigation. The case is being investigated under the direction of the Calcutta High Court, which criticized Kolkata Police for its handling of the matter.",

            "content": "On Sriperumbudur Main Road, Amarambedu would roll past without drawing a whisper of discussion \u2014 but for a stone structure. Though derelict, the structure is limited edition. In the Chennai Metropolitan Area, there are not many structures set in this mould that are out there still. The stones had been marshalled into place centuries ago, and the building is robust thumbing its nose at time\u2019s ruthless, impersonal scythe. The crown of weeds it wore on its head and a couple of hay bundles it held in its bowels \u2014 on September 1, 2024 \u2014 suggest that it might not be as cherished as it should be. However, its significance is not lost in the everyday bustle, as proved by a bus stop right on the other side of the road. The stopover takes its name after the village and the chatram \u2014 Amarambedu Chatram stop. In Kundrathur block, Amarambedu panchayat consists of a collection of villages, but the locality has a somnolence that sets back time, the chatram actively engaged in that process. From Amarambedu, the temple town of Kancheepuram is a 42-kilometre roll of the tyres away, and in olden times, this chatram served as a pit stop for pilgrims (to and from the temple town) to rest and recharge their batteries for the walk ahead. A close parallel can be found at Mahabalipuram on East Coast Road, where a chatram stands on the way to the space with the temple complex. Just as at the chatram in Mahabalipuram, the roof at the Amarambedu chatram sports squiggly snakes, one of them gobbling an orb, suggesting the depiction of an eclipse. In addition, there are depictions of fish on the roof. A resident recalls the picturisation of a song in the old Rajnikanth-starrer Manithan at the chatram. In fact, someone, clearly a Rajnikanth fan, has painted an image of the star on a pillar.

            "content": "A Cabinet meeting under the leadership of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah scheduled in Kalaburagi on Tuesday will discuss various key issues, new projects as well as pending projects and prepare a blueprint for comprehensive development of the region, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Priyank Kharge has said. Addressing presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Kharge said that besides new projects and sanctioning funds for approved projects, the Cabinet will take a decision on filling vacant posts in the region. Already, 800 engineers have been recruited in the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department, he added. The Minister said that a proposal has been submitted to the government seeking funds for irrigation projects in Kalaburagi and Bidar districts. Roads across the seven districts of the region will be repaired and upgraded under the Kalyana Patha Scheme in the next two years. Ruling out any compromise in the development of the region, Mr. Kharge said that nearly 2.5 lakh government posts in the State are lying vacant and they will be filled in a phased manner. Responding to a question, Mr. Kharge said that Leader of Opposition in Council Chalavadi Narayanaswami, who staged a protest in Kalaburagi on Monday, should demonstrate against his party MLA Munirathna who has been arrested on the charge of issuing a life threat to a contractor and using castiest slurs against him. Mr. Kharge also sought a clarification from Mr. Narayanaswamy whether he is running a biryani hotel on the land allotted to him for establishing an educational institution. Mr. Kharge said that a fast-track court should be set up to investigate BJP leaders said to be involved in scams and not for the actor Darshan case. Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of maintaining a studied silence on the Nagamangala violence, PoCSO Act cases and the Munirathna case, Mr. Kharge asked why Mr. Modi does not speak about these issues. Minister for Medical Education Sharanprakash Patil said that from 2013 to 2018, nearly 30,000 vacancies (including 13,000 teacher posts) have been filled in the Kalyana Karnataka region. Another 15,000 vacancies will be filled in the next one year and 25,000 posts in the next two years, he added. Liberation Day Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Mr. Siddaramaiah will garland the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in the city and participate in the Kalyana Karnataka Liberation Day celebrations at the District Armed Reserve Police Grounds.

            "content": "Advanced treatments like CAR-T cell therapy and bone marrow transplants are significantly improving outcomes for lymphoma patients, experts highlight during World Lymphoma Awareness Month. New Delhi: Advanced treatments like targeted therapy, CAR-T cell therapy, and Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) are boosting outcomes for patients with Lymphoma, a type of blood cancer that affects the immune system, said experts on Monday. September is celebrated as World Lymphoma awareness month. Lymphoma is considered to be a fairly common cancer in India and develops in white blood cells called lymphocytes. It accounts for approximately 3-4 per cent of all cancers globally and is divided into two main types: Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), with NHL being the more common form. In India, the incidence of lymphoma stands at around 1.8-2.5 cases per 100,000 people annually, with NHL being more prevalent, particularly among older adults. Survival rates for lymphoma have seen significant improvement over the years, with a 5-year survival rate of about 86 per cent for HL and around 72 per cent for NHL. Hodgkins develop majorly in the upper body, like the neck, chest, or armpits, while non-Hodgkins develop in lymph nodes anywhere in the body. \u201cModern treatment methods along with safe and effective treatment options like targeted therapy, CAR-T cell therapy, and BMT have helped improve the clinical outcomes in a big way. Many patients recover successfully after being declared terminal because of the use of innovative modules which proves to be an effective treatment option,\u201d Dr. Ashish Gupta, Medical Oncologist at Unique Hospital Cancer Centre, New Delhi, told IANS. Early detection is particularly important for Hodgkin's Lymphoma, as its cure rate is significantly higher when caught in the early stages. Raising awareness helps individuals recognise key symptoms like swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and fatigue, which are often mistaken for more common illnesses. \u201cImmunotherapy, particularly CAR-T cell therapy, has emerged as a breakthrough for treating certain lymphoma types, especially those resistant to other treatments. Precision medicine, through genetic profiling, allows for personalised treatment strategies, enhancing effectiveness and minimising harm,\u201d Dr. C N Patil, HOD and Lead Consultant - Medical Oncology & Haemato-Oncology, Aster RV Hospital, told IANS. Advancements in technology have significantly transformed lymphoma treatment, making it more effective and reducing side effects. The overall survival rate has increased, with Hodgkin's Lymphoma seeing up to 80-90 per cent cure rates when treated early. Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, which has more subtypes, sees a varied survival rate based on the aggressiveness of the subtype but has improved with newer therapies. Targeted therapies, such as drugs like Rituximab and Brentuximab, specifically attack cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, leading to better patient outcomes. In addition, improvements in radiation therapy have made treatments more focused, reducing damage to healthy surrounding tissues and improving overall patient care.",

Under this programme, medical camps will be organised every Sunday across the constituency up to a period of one year. \u201cInformation Technology and Communication & Industries Minister, Nara Lokesh, son of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, urges the cadre to not only work for the party but also for the welfare of the people. Drawing inspiration from him, I have initiated this programme in his name to provide free medical care to the poor,\u201d Mr. Sridhar Reddy told The Hindu . \u201cMany patients are dying due to the delay in diagnosis, unable to recognise their illnesses in advance. They are deprived of medical tests due to the cost burden, thus neglecting the disease until it reaches the final stages. We have started this programme with an aim of saving their lives,\u201d he informed. Telugu Desam Party (TDP) youth leader Datla Chakradhar Reddy was made the convener of the programme, which will commence from September 22 at Devarapalem village.

In a mega upset, China stunned Pakistan 2-0 in the shootout on Monday to enter the Final of the Asian Champions Trophy here at the Moqi Hockey Training Base in China. It is the first time in the history of the tournament that the Chinese national team has made it to the final. While the second-highest number of title winners Pakistan will play for the Bronze medal against the loser of the second semifinal between India and Korea. The Chinese goalkeeper Caiyu Wang was outstanding in his efforts to keep a clean slate in the shootout, while, Benhai Chen and Chanliang Lin scored for China. Earlier in the match, Yuanlin Lu had given China an early 1-0 lead in the 18th minute. The first semifinal of the day truly lived up to its billing, with China posing a mega threat to Pakistan's hopes of making the final right from the start. They were gritty in their pursuit, dominated the ball possession, and created early chances. (How Earrings Worth Rs 1 Lakh Caused Ruckus Between Cristiano Ronaldo And Erik Ten Hag At Manchester United) The 1-0 lead for China put Pakistan on the backfoot. China also came up with brilliant defence in the second quarter to stop Pakistan from scoring a Penalty Corner (PC). They had created as many as five PCs this quarter but could not breach the Chinese defence.

They punctured Pakistan's attack and kept the pressure on through tactful defending. Though Pakistan mustered a goal in the 37th minute through Ahmed Nadeem, China ensured they didn't concede another goal. They played a disciplined game, tackled Pakistani attackers with strong man-to-man marking to ensure they didn't create scoring opportunities. Though Pakistan made a handful of circle entries in the following minutes in the third and the fourth quarter, China restricted their shots on goal quite effectively to keep the scoreline at 1-1 stalemate.",

            "content": "A 47-year-old woman\u2019s death in a hit-and-run accident at Sasthamcotta in Kollam district on Monday has triggered a public outcry. The police identified the deceased as Kunju Mol. She was riding pillion when a car rammed the two-wheeler from behind. The vehicle ran over the woman, who fell on the road in the impact of the collision. It then sped away from the scene, prompting a major search for the vehicle and driver. Ms. Kunju Mol\u2019s relative, Fousiya, who was driving the two-wheeler, escaped with minor injuries. Later, the police arrested Ajmal, 27, and his co-passenger, a woman doctor, in connection with the incident. The Kollam police, quoting a blood alcohol test report, alleged that Mr. Ajmal drove the car when he was alcohol-impaired. They said the co-passenger also tested positive in the test, which government doctors conducted at the police\u2019s behest. Grainy surveillance camera footage of the frightful accident went viral on conventional and social media, raising questions about the safety of two-wheeler riders and pedestrians on the State\u2019s busy roads. Public give chase The police said Mr. Ajmal drove away from the spot, fearing public anger. Some passersby tried to stop the car, while a few others gave chase on motorcycles. Mr. Ajmal succeeded in throwing his pursuers off the scent but was later tracked and arrested by the police. The police said the accident occurred after Mr. Ajmal and his co-passenger left a friend\u2019s party. They have registered a case under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 281 (rash and negligent driving), 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 125 (a) (Rash or careless acts that put human life or personal safety at risk), 125 (b) (grievous hurt) and relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act. Service terminated Meanwhile, a private hospital which employed the doctor terminated her service on the charge of breaching medical ethics for fleeing the spot without attending to the accident victim. The State Human Rights Commission have taken suo motu cognisance of the offence and ordered the registration of a case. It sought a report from the police, the Motor Vehicles department, and the district administration.

            "description": "He alleges that the NDA government is rolling back key educational reforms initiated by YSRCP aimed at providing quality education to the underprivileged",
            "content": "The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) president and former Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has urged Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to immediately stop actions that weaken government schools, emphasising the importance of education as a tool to permanently eradicate poverty. Taking to the social media platform X on Monday, Mr. Jagan criticised the government for rolling back key educational reforms aimed at providing quality education to the underprivileged. The State government was taking regressive steps by cancelling the CBSE syllabus in government schools, thereby undermining the quality of education for economically poor students. There is a clear contradiction in the TDP\u2019s approach. While they ensure the best education for children in private schools, they neglect the educational needs of children in government schools. Do the TDP intend to keep government school students at a lower level permanently? he asked. The YSRCP government had introduced a series of reforms to transform the State government schools, including initiatives like \u2018Nadu-Nedu,\u2019 the introduction of English medium, CBSE affiliation, and the incorporation of interactive learning methods. These reforms aimed at elevating the standard of education and provide government school students with opportunities comparable to those in private institutions. However, the TDP-led coalition government was systematically undoing these efforts, in a deliberate attempt to push government school students towards private institutions owned by TDP leaders, he alleged. Mr. Jagan alleged that depriving government schoolchildren of access to world-class education would only harm the future of these students. The former Chief Minister defended government school teachers, stating that they are highly qualified, having passed competitive exams and received extensive training. The TDP government, however, was demoralising them. The government needs to recognise their capabilities and contributions to the education sector, he said.

            "content": "The rupee witnessed range-bound trade and settled for the day higher by 4 paise at 83.88 (provisional) against the U.S. dollar on Monday (September 16, 2024) supported by weak American currency and significant foreign fund inflows, while firm crude oil prices capped sharp gains. Forex traders said market participants are eagerly awaiting cues from the U.S. Fed policy on Wednesday (September 11, 2024), with a rate cut all but certain. However, the magnitude of the cut remains uncertain. Moreover, the rupee continues to hold steady within a well-defined range on active intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), they added. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.89 and witnessed an intraday high of 83.87 and a low of 83.90 against the American currency. The domestic unit finally settled for the day at 83.88 (provisional), higher by 4 paise over its previous close, amid a positive trend in domestic equities. On Friday (September 13, 2024), the local unit settled higher by 4 paise at 83.92 against the U.S. dollar. \"We expect the Indian rupee to trade with a slight positive bias on continued weakness in the U.S. dollar ahead of the FOMC meeting this week,\" said Anuj Choudhary \u2013 Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. Choudhary further said that \"there are broad expectations of a 25 bps rate cut by the Fed following a 25 bps rate cut by ECB last week. Fresh foreign inflows and a positive tone in equity markets may further support the domestic currency. However, a recovery in crude oil prices may cap sharp upside.\" Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was down 0.39% to 100.72 points. Brent crude, the international benchmark, gained 0.56% to USD 72.01 per barrel in futures trade. In the domestic equity market, the 30-share BSE Sensex advanced 97.84 points, or 0.12%, to close at 82,988.78 points, while the Nifty rose 27.25 points, or 0.11%, to 25,383.75 points. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital markets on Friday (September 13, 2024), as they purchased shares worth \u20b92,364.82 crore, according to exchange data. Meanwhile, India's forex reserves jumped USD 5.248 billion to a new all-time high of USD 689.235 billion for the week ended September 6, the Reserve Bank of India said on Friday (September 13, 2024). The overall kitty had jumped by USD 2.299 billion to a record USD 683.987 billion for the previous reporting week.

Mr. Muraleedharan also sought an investigation into Mr. Anvar\u2019s accusation that a top police officer had ordered illegal wiretaps on Ministers, political leaders, including Opposition figures and journalists. Mr. Muraleedharan asked the administration to clarify whether it had ordered the wiretap or was aware of the eavesdropping operation.

His demand came close on the heels of Kerala Governor Arif Muhammad Khan\u2019s request to report on the wiretapping allegations.

            "content": "The new Covid variant XEC, a more contagious strain, is rapidly spreading across 15 countries, presenting new challenges for public health and requiring updated precautions. New Delhi: Covid seems to be rising again with a new and more contagious variant -- XEC -- spreading rapidly across 15 countries. First detected in Germany in June, XEC is a combination of the KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 variants. According to reports, it has already overtaken the previously dominant FliRT strain of the deadly virus. The strain, belonging to the Omicron variant, is currently spreading \"quite rapidly\" across Europe, North America and Asia. About 550 samples have now been reported, from 27 countries, including Poland, Norway, Luxembourg, Ukraine, Portugal, the US and China have now reported samples. \"At this juncture, the XEC variant appears to be the most likely one to get legs next,\" Eric Topol, Director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, US, said in a recent post on X. As per experts, XEC comes with some new mutations that might help it spread this autumn. However, vaccines may help prevent severe cases. In a post on X, a Melbourne-based data expert Mike Honey stated that XEC strain is \"a likely next challenger to the currently dominant variants\". Honey noted that XEC has already charged ahead of other variants like the FLiRT, FLuQU and DEFLuQE strains. The strain reportedly causes symptoms that are similar to those experienced with common illnesses such as influenza and colds. While most people will get better within a few weeks, for some it may take longer to recover and some may even require hospitalisation. According to the UK NHS, the variant causes flu-like symptoms which includes a high temperature or shivering (chills), a new, continuous cough, a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste, shortness of breath, fatigue, body ache, loss of appetite, among others.",

            "content": "Folktales are a story-telling tradition that have been handed down from generation to generation and are not necessarily true. A long time ago, a rich man and a poor man had a field in common. They always sowed it with the same seed at the same time of the year. One year, as was their practice, the rich man and the poor man sowed their field with the same seed. However, God prospered the poor man\u2019s hard work and made the seed grow. The rich man was surprised to find that his seeds had not sprouted. A quarrel Angry, he shouted at the poor man saying, \u201cLook, my seed has prospered and not yours.\u201d The poor man was shocked and protested feebly, \u201cOh no! It is my seed that has grown.\u201d The rich man was adamant. \u201cThis is my seed that has sprouted.\u201d The more the poor man protested, the more the rich man was adamant. Finally, he said, \u201cIf you do not believe me, then let us find out tomorrow. Come to this field at the crack of dawn and we will ask God to be our judge.\u201d The poor man could only agree. Trickery That night, the rich man dug a deep trench in the poor man\u2019s portion of the field and told his son to hide in the ground. \u201cTomorrow morning, when I come here and ask aloud \u2018Whose field is this\u2019, you must say it is mine,\u201d He said. The son willingly agreed. The rich man covered his son with straw and went home. Early the next morning, many people from the village gathered at the field to witness God\u2019s decision. The rich man went close to the hole in which he had buried his son and said, \u201cOh God, please find a solution to our dilemma. Please let us who this land belongs to.\u201d Immediately, the son shouted from his hiding place, \u201cIt is the rich man\u2019s land. Indeed, it is the rich man\u2019s land.\u201d Justice served But, unknown to the rich man and his son, God himself was in the crowd of people who had gathered. Angry with the unjust behaviour of the rich man and his son God said, \u201cDo not listen to that voice. That is the rich man\u2019s son whom he has buried in the ground. I tell you, this is the poor man\u2019s land.\u201d All the people there were surprised. They were astounded by the callousness of the rich man. Then God said to the rich man, \u201cAs a punishment, your son will stay beneath the earth all the days of his life, as long as the sun is in the sky.\u201d The rich man\u2019s son was transformed into a mole and spent the rest of his life below the earth\u2019s surface, fleeing with the rising of the sun. Ever since, moles are known to hide from the sun. Published - September 16, 2024 07:29 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Young World",

            "content": "HYDERABAD The Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) has alleged that it is only to appease AICC leader Sonia Gandhi that the Congress government in the State has installed the statue of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who has no connection with the Statehood of Telangana, in front of the Secretariat building. Stating that the previous BRS government had planned to install a \u2018Telangana Thalli\u2019 statue at the site as part of a plaza comprising a police station, food courts and a bus stop, BRS leaders V. Prashanth Reddy, Soma Bharath Kumar and others said Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy had got the Rajiv Gandhi statue installed there to please the Delhi bosses of the Congress and to mortgage the self respect of Telangana people in Delhi. The designs of the plaza planned there along with the Telangana Thalli statue were prepared in June 2023 but the Assembly elections had prevented the then government from taking up the work. Further, they alleged that the State government was resorting to such tactics to divert the dissatisfaction among people about the implementation of pre-poll promises. It was with a view to keep the sacrifices of Telangana martyrs afresh always that the previous government had got the \u2018Amara Jyothi\u2019 structure/memorial constructed in a size that was larger than the Chicago Bean structure, but the Congress government was not opening it for public as part of a conspiracy to discontinue all the good work done by the K. Chandrasekhar Rao government. However, Mr. Revanth Reddy was making use of the Command Control Centre and Secretariat buildings. Similarly, the Congress government was also not allowing people to the 125 feet tall B.R. Ambedkar statue, the BRS leaders said. \u2018Will move RG statue\u2019 Meanwhile, the BRS has given a call to cleanse the Telangana Thalli statues across the State on Tuesday to protest the installation of Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s statue in front of the Secretariat building against the plans to install a Telangana Thalli statue there. In a statement, working president of the party K.T. Rama Rao has strongly objected to the installation of Rajiv Gandhi statue at the site earmarked for Telangana Thalli statue. He reiterated that the Rajiv Gandhi statue would be shifted to Gandhi Bhavan, once the BRS was voted back to power.

Mr. Yadav also said the double engine government in Bihar had nothing else to talk about, and hence was busy invoking \u201cHindu, Muslims, Mandir, Masjid, Pakistan, Kashmir and Bangladesh\u201d.",
            "content": "Leader of the Opposition in Bihar legislative assembly and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Monday (September 16, 2024) hit back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remark that Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) , RJD and Congress were the three biggest enemies of Jharkhand. Mr. Yadav said Mr. Modi was the biggest enemy of Bihar for meting out a stepmotherly treatment to the State. Referring to the BJP-JD(U) government in Bihar, he said the double engine government in Bihar had nothing else to talk about, and hence was busy invoking \u201cHindu, Muslims, Mandir, Masjid, Pakistan, Kashmir and Bangladesh\u201d. On September 15, while addressing the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) Parivartan Maharally at Gopal Maidan in Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, where elections are due later this year, Mr. Modi had remarked that Jharkhand has three biggest enemies \u2014 JMM, RJD and Congress. The Prime Minister also said that the most dishonest and highly corrupt party and family in this country was the Congress. Mr. Yadav launched a broadside at Mr. Modi while speaking to the media during his ongoing yatra in Muzaffarpur. He said, \u201cHe [Mr. Modi] has nothing else to talk about these days. Has he visited Manipur yet? He has made ministers of rapists from his party. Has any action been taken against them? The Prime Minister is the biggest enemy of Bihar and is meting out a stepmotherly treatment to the State. He neither gave special category status to Bihar nor a special package.\u201d The RJD leader further said, \u201cThe Centre has said no to the special category status demand of Bihar. When election comes, the BJP leaders say yes [to the demand] to gain votes. After the elections, they say no. In the 11 years of his government, the PM has pushed Bihar to the abyss. If you check the NITI Aayog\u2019s report, you will find that Bihar\u2019s performance is the worst, with maximum poverty, and migration of around 2.9 crore people. Bihar has the lowest Per Capita Income. Will the PM say anything on these issues? It is the BJP which ruled Jharkhand for the longest period. Then who is the enemy of development? The PM should first do research before speaking on any issue instead of just reading from the teleprompter.\u201d Training his guns at the BJP-JD(U) coalition government in Bihar, Mr. Yadav said the double engine government did nothing about the prevailing public issues but was busy talking about Hindu, Muslims, Mandir, Masjid, Pakistan, Kashmir and Bangladesh. The former Deputy Chief Minister said that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had become deaf, dumb and blind to the issue of rising crimes in the State. He also accused Mr. Kumar of \u2018snooping\u2019 on him during the yatra in Darbhanga. \u201cI really don\u2019t know why the government is so afraid of my yatra. In Darbhanga, we found people from CID and Special Branch sitting in the workers\u2019 meeting. It was a closed-door meeting in which even the press was not allowed. However, our workers pointed out that two people in the gathering were neither from the press nor party workers. They were clicking the photographs. After a while, we came to know that they were people from the CID and Special Branch. I wish the government instead spied on criminals and corrupt people,\u201d Mr. Yadav said.

            "description": "City buses bound for the central bus stand are supposed to turn left from Bharathiar Road to enter the second entrance road. But most buses skip this route during peak hours",
            "content": "Passengers are put to hardship as some of the city buses continue to skip the second entry road leading to the Junction Railway Station in Tiruchi. The second entry road abutting Bharathiar Salai to Junction was laid to ensure the free flow of vehicular movement and ease congestion in front of the station\u2019s main entrance. City buses bound for the central bus stand are supposed to turn left from Bharathiar Salai to enter the second entrance road. After dropping passengers at the second entry road, buses take a U-turn to enter Bharathiar Salai again before proceeding to the bus stand. However, some buses skip the route, especially during peak hours, and continue on the Bharathiar Salai to reach the bus stand. They stop near the roundabout in front of the station to drop commuters. Heavy movement of vehicles at the Junction roundabout adds to the traffic woes. During peak hours, the commuters waiting at the railway station bus stop have to wait long to board a city bus. \u201cSome buses enter the road only if they have to drop a commuter at the railway station bus stop. The practice of not halting at the stop is frequent, and we are forced to wait longer or hire autorickshaws, which become expensive at times,\u201d said T. Selvam, a regular commuter. Besides causing inconvenience, reckless driving by private city buses is a threat to road users accessing Bharathiar Salai, especially near the roundabout, commuters added. Despite placing barricades near the entry road to caution and redirect buses to the road, some city buses continue to skip the stop. Police personnel have also been deployed at the entry point of the road to check violations. A senior police official said that they would ensure that buses were directed to go via the railway junction bus stop.

            "description": "State government says the figures, which were submitted to the Kerala High Court in a suo motu petition initiated by the Division Bench, are not the money spent on the ground but part of the memorandum submitted to the Union government for securing Central aid",
            "content": "The cost estimation of the response and relief measures following the Wayanad tragedy has run into a controversy with the BJP and the IUML alleging that the government claimed to spend huge amounts for relief measures which the volunteers had undertaken free of cost. However, the State government was quick to respond that the figures, which were submitted to the Kerala High Court in a suo motu petition initiated by the Division Bench, were not the money spent on the ground but part of the memorandum submitted to the Union government for securing Central aid. The estimate, which was prepared by following the National Disaster Response Fund norms, had also covered the anticipated and possible escalation in the costs, according the government. Incidentally, some sections of the media had reported that the government had claimed to have incurred an expense of \u20b92.76 crore for burying 359 bodies at the rate of \u20b975,000 a body. The other expenses in the memorandum included \u20b910 crore for food and water supply for volunteers and troops, \u20b91 crore for the construction of Bailey bridge and allied works and \u20b915 crore for accommodation for volunteers and troops. It had also estimated \u20b917 crore as the expense for the aircraft of the Indian Air Force used for transporting troops, air-lifting of survivors and dead bodies and VIP movement. BJP State President K. Surendran accused the State government of engaging in mindless exploitation and corruption under the cover of the disaster. Though the volunteers laid to rest the victims without claiming any remuneration, the government claimed to have incurred \u20b975,000 per dead body, he alleged. In his social media post, Indian Union Muslim League leader P.K. Kunjalikutty said the government had insulted hundreds of volunteers who carried out the relief and rescue works. He demanded transparency in the financial transactions. In a communication, the office of the Chief Minister stated that a section of the media was wrongly portraying the estimation in the memorandum, which was prepared by following the National Disaster Response Fund norms and submitted to the union government as the actual expenses incurred by the government. The deliberate and wrong depiction of the details of the memorandum was part of the efforts to torpedo the efforts of the State government to obtain maximum Central aid and to provide adequate assistance to the victims, the statement said.

            "content": "In a bid to rejuvenate tourism in Wayanad following the devastating landslides at Chooralmala, over two dozen social media influencers will gather in the district on September 17 (Tuesday). The initiative marks a crucial phase in Kerala Tourism\u2019s promotional campaign titled \u2018My Kerala, Beautiful As Ever\u2019, designed to attract holidaymakers from around the globe. Tourism and Public Works Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas will inaugurate the campaign by unveiling the official video and engaging in discussions with the influencers at Mananthavady at 5 p.m. on Tuesday. Approximately 30 influential content creators, recognised for their substantial online following, will explore Wayanad\u2019s scenic spots to document their experiences, showcasing the region\u2019s enduring beauty amid the adversity. The hospitality sector faced a massive wave of booking cancellations following the tragedy, driven by a flood of negative narratives on social media platforms. \u201cThe tourism sector suffered severely as many labelled the incident as the Wayanad disaster, despite it being confined to a limited area,\u201d said Mr. Riyas. The Minister said the negative perception led to widespread cancellations, impacting the livelihoods of numerous families within the tourism-dependent community. Mr. Riyas said the government had devised a comprehensive plan aimed at reviving Wayanad\u2019s tourism sector, which had seen a resurgence in visitor numbers since the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government took charge. Before the landslides, Wayanad had emerged as a premier destination, with many resorts experiencing full bookings over weekends, underscoring its popularity. Wayanad was the inaugural location for the Safe Kerala initiative launched after the COVID-19 pandemic, but the recent events have overshadowed those efforts. Mr. Riyas expressed optimism that the \u2018My Kerala, Beautiful As Ever\u2019 campaign would reinvigorate tourism across the State. \u201cThis event is part of a broader series of strategic initiatives planned by the Department of Tourism to attract visitors to God\u2019s own country,\u201d he said.

According to sources, T. Tamilselvam, 31, a policeman attached to Thalavai police station and Venkatesan, 42, a home guard, spotted the minitruck on Annasinallur-Anganur road. Suspecting that it was transporting sand, they signalled the driver to stop the vehicle. However, it was said that the vehicle did not stop, forcing them to chase it on a two-wheeler. During the chase, the minitruck reportedly hit the handle of the two-wheeler and sped away. While Mr. Tamilselvan suffered injuries on his hands, Mr. Venkatesan sustained injuries on his legs. Both of them were rushed to the Government Medical College Hospital in Ariyalur. The Thalavai police have registered a case and are investigating. Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur, Selvaraj visited the injured at the hospital and enquired about the incident.

Elambahavath on Monday. The petitioners said the Ayyanadaippu village panchayat had a sizable Scheduled Caste population working as farmhands and under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. If the panchayat was merged with the Corporation, welfare schemes such as MGNREGA and free housing would be snatched away, while there would be manifold increase in taxes payable to the Corporation such as property tax, vacant land tax, drinking water tax and professional tax . Since the poor residents of Ayyanadaippu village panchayat could not afford to pay the increased taxes, while losing their job under the MGNREGA scheme, the move to annex the rural local body with the Corporation should be given up, they prayed. The petitioners said the Corporation, which had annexed the peripheral areas up to Muthaiahpuram in the south, was planning to extend its boundaries in the west up to Korampallam and Ayyanadaippu so that the Collectorate campus and the manufacturing units in SIPCOT Industrial Estate would also be part of the urban civic body. Mr. Elambahavath received 420 petitions on Monday and handed over two hand-pedalled tricycles and a wheelchair. He also received 26 petitions from differently abled persons.

            "content": ": The State government has cancelled the Reverse Tendering process introduced by the previous government headed by the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) in August 2020. It issued GO 40 to this effect on Sunday (September 15), reverting to the conventional tendering process that existed prior to 2020. In the GO, Special Chief Secretary, Water Resources Department, G. Sai Prasad said that the Chairman of the Board of Chief Engineers (BoCEs) and the Engineer-in-Chief (Administration Wing/ Irrigation Wing), Water Resources Department, had recommended the government to restore the status quo ante in place of the existing reverse tendering process. The existing online e-procurement system, which was earlier revamped to suit the reverse tendering process, would be revived/restored to suit the earlier tendering process for the entrustment of works in all government departments and corporations, he said. During the implementation of the reverse tendering process, certain drawbacks were observed and thus the Board of Chief Engineers was asked to review the same and submit their recommendations. The government, after careful examination of the matter and based on the recommendations of the Board of Chief Engineers, cancelled the orders issued regarding the reverse tendering process vide GO Ms. No.67, Water Resources (Reforms) Department, dated August 16, 2019. The government departments and corporations were instructed to implement the conventional tender process for entrustment of works, he added. The State Cabinet, in its meeting held on August 28 this year, decided to cancel the revere tendering process introduced by the previous YSRCP government citing \u201cbreach of secrecy.\u201d The government said it was decided to reintroduce the old tendering policy for all the departments, and that the government would follow the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) guidelines in this regard.

            "content": "The first council meeting of the Namakkal Corporation was held on Monday. Mayor D. Kalanithi presided over the meeting. A total of 91 resolutions were passed in the meeting, including a resolution thanking the State government for upgrading the Namakkal Municipality as a Corporation. Rajya Sabha member K.R.N. Rajeshkumar handed over Sengol to the Mayor. Councillor of Ward 36 P. Vijay Anand said that the stray dog menace had increased in the Corporation limits and in his ward, the dogs pose a threat to the school-going students. Highlighting the same issue, Ward 5 councillor N. Krishnamoorthy said due to the functioning of chilli chicken centres and meat shops, roaming of dogs had increased in his ward. Recently, a motorist, who sustained injuries after a dog chased his bike, died. So, the Corporation should take steps to prevent the stray dog menace, he added. Ward 34 councillor V. Ilamparuthi said that as per government norms, no toll plazas should be located in 10-km radius of Corporation limits. But, Keerambur toll plaza was situated within 2-km radius of the Corporation and the civic body should take up the issue with the concerned departments. Replying to this, Corporation Commissioner R. Maheswari said that a letter was sent to the government regarding the toll plaza. Ward 9 councillor Nandhakumar said that as the weekly shandy was functioning near the Corporation office on Tiruchengode Road, there was heavy traffic congestion and to prevent accidents, speed-breakers should be installed. Nine panchayats were annexed with Namakkal Municipality 10 years ago. For these places, 23,000 drinking water connections were given and the people had paid deposits.

            "content": "NPS 'Vatsalya' offers flexible contributions and investment options, allowing parents to make an investment of Rs 1,000 annually in the name of the child, thus making it accessible to families from all economic backgrounds. New Delhi: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to introduce the New Pension Scheme (NPS) 'Vatsalya' for children in New Delhi on September 18. The new pension scheme announced in the Union Budget 2024 which allows parents to contribute to their children's NPS accounts, helping them build a retirement fund and secure their financial future. According to Ministry of Finance, the NPS Vatsalya events will be held simultaneously at around 75 locations across the country during the launch. However, these locations will connect via video conference, where PRAN (Permanent Retirement Account Number) membership cards will also be distributed to new minor subscribers. FM Sitharaman will also unveil an online platform for subscribing to NPS Vatsalya, release a scheme brochure, and distribute PRAN cards to new minor subscribers. The scheme allows children to withdraw a portion of the accumulated corpus as a lump sum and receive the rest as regular pension payments. \u201cNPS 'Vatsalya' will allow parents to save for their children\u2019s future by investing in a pension account and ensure long-term wealth with the power of compounding,\u201d said the ministry. It is important to note that upon reaching adulthood, the child's account will convert into a regular NPS account. Parents can start with a modest monthly contribution of Rs 500 or an annual contribution of Rs 6,000. Under the NPS Vatsalya Scheme, parents are allowed to invest Rs 1,000 annually in the name of their child, making it accessible to families from all economic backgrounds. NPS Vatsalya To Secure the Financial Future Of Children This new initiative is designed to start early in securing the financial future of children, marking an important step in India\u2019s pension system. The scheme will be run under the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). \u201cThe launch of NPS Vatsalya highlights the government of India's commitment to promote long-term financial planning and security for all,\u201d said the ministry.

            "content": "Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari\u2019s inspection of the progress of the long-delayed Vikravandi-Kumbakonam-Thanjavur national highway development last week has raised hopes that the project would finally get a much-needed push. The project is widely considered to be an important infrastructure development for the delta region. The Minister observed that it was an important corridor for the development of Villupuram, Cuddalore, Ariyalur, Tiruvarur, and Thanjavur districts. The project, he conceded, had run into a long delay as it was scheduled to have been completed by September 2020. The whole project, he said, was delayed because of various factors, including Cyclone Gaja, the COVID-19 pandemic, and delay in land acquisition. According to the Minister, about 95% of the work on two packages of the project \u2014 Thanjavur to Cholapuram and Cholapuram to Sethiyathope \u2014 have been completed. The NHAI had decided to terminate the contract of the other package and go for fresh tender. The work would be started as soon as possible, he said. The Minister\u2019s inspection and his assurances on the project has raised hopes among Kumbakonam residents. \u201cThe project had been moving at a snail\u2019s pace. The Minister\u2019s personal inspection of the project has raised big hopes among us. We wish the highway section between Cholapuram and Thanjavur would be fully completed and opened for traffic soon. We hope that the other package too would be executed expeditiously following the Minister\u2019s visit,\u201d said A. Giri, a resident of Kumbakonam. The four-lane Cholapuram-Thanjavur section runs for 48 km and includes two bypass sections, four major bridges and 15 vehicular underpasses/flyovers. The Sethiyathope-Cholapuram section runs for a distance of about 50 km and includes three bypasses, four major bridges and 20 VUPs/flyovers. Emphasising the need for expediting the construction of the Vikravandi-Sethiyathope section, V. Sathiyanarayanan, Secretary, All Traders Associations of Kumbakonam, said this was a vital section for commerce and tourism as it connected important places such as Neyveli, Kumbakonam, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur. Pointing out that the next mahamaham festival is scheduled for 2028, he said it was essential that the project was executed on a war footing. \u201cThe development of the highway section has been going on for several years. The delay in the project has resulted in increased travel time, traffic congestion, and accidents,\u201d Mr. Sathiyanarayanan said in a representation addressed to the Minister. He urged the Minister to upgrade the Kumbakonam-T. Palur-Jayamkondam-Vridhachalam-Ulundurpet State highway as a national highway and connect it to the Golden Quadrilateral.

            "content": "Equity benchmark index Sensex rebounded nearly 100 points to hit a lifetime closing high on Monday (September 16, 2024), while the broader Nifty ended just shy of its record peak, propelled by bargain hunting in energy, utility and banking stocks amid sustained foreign fund inflows. The 30-share BSE Sensex climbed 97.84 points or 0.12% to settle at a new record peak of 82,988.78. During the day, it jumped 293.4 points or 0.35% to hit a fresh lifetime intra-day high of 83,184.34. The NSE Nifty rose 27.25 points or 0.11% to settle at 25,383.75, over 5 points lower than its previous record. During the day, the benchmark gained 89.2 points or 0.35% to hit a new intra-day high of 25,445.70. \u201cThe domestic market traded in a narrow range with a positive bias as the participants are keenly awaiting the Fed\u2019s decision this week. The weakness in the U.S. job market and benign inflation are pointing at a slew of rate cuts on the table. \u201cThe inflow of foreign money and an expectation of stability in domestic growth may keep sentiment optimistic,\u201d Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said. NTPC was the biggest gainer on the Sensex chart, rising 2.44%, followed by JSW Steel, Larsen & Toubro, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Nestle, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Steel. Bajaj Finance declined over 3%. Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finserv, Adani Port and Asian Paints were the other laggards. \u201cThe Indian markets continued their bullish trend, with Nifty reaching a new record high, driven primarily by foreign institutional investor (FII) buying and a strong market breadth. \u201cInvestors remain cautiously optimistic ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting later this week, which could influence short-term trends. Investors are advised to stay aligned with the current trend but watch for potential market reactions to the U.S. Fed\u2019s policy announcements,\u201d Vikram Kasat, Head - Advisory, PL Capital - Prabhudas Lilladher, said. In the broader market, the BSE smallcap gauge climbed 0.28% while the midcap index ended marginally up by 0.01%. Among the indices, utilities jumped 1.97%, power (1.93%), metal (0.65%), capital goods (0.56%), consumer durables (0.49%) and industrials (0.33%). IT, telecommunication, tech, services and FMCG were the laggards. In Asian markets, Hong Kong ended with gains. Markets in Japan, mainland China and South Korea were closed for holidays. European markets were trading mostly higher. The U.S. markets ended in positive territory on Friday (September 13, 2024). Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought equities worth \u20b92,364.82 crore on Friday, according to exchange data. Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) also bought equities worth \u20b92,532.18 crore. Global oil benchmark Brent crude climbed 0.35% to USD 71.90 a barrel. \u201cGlobally equity markets will be focused on the Fed rate action on Wednesday, which is likely to influence the stock market trend in the near-term,\u201d said V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. On Friday (September 13, 2024), the BSE benchmark Sensex fell by 71.77 points or 0.09% to settle at 82,890.94.

            "content": "The Laghu Udyog Bharat - Tamil Nadu (LUB-TN), an organisation espousing the cause of Micro and Small Industries, has called upon the Railway Ministry to fulfil specific infrastrutural requirements and services in Coimbatore and other western districts that would potential double revenue from the region to over \u20b91,400 crore. A delegation of LUB-TN recently called upon Ashwini Vaishnaw, Railway Minister, in New Delhi and submitted a memorandum containing a list of demands. In the financial year 2023-24, Coimbatore generated a total revenue of approximately \u20b9650 crore, with \u20b9350 crore from passenger services and \u20b9300 crore from freight operations, the memorandum said. Coimbatore played a pivotal role in the Southern Railways network. With 150 train services, the Coimbatore region contributed significantly to railway revenues, accounting for the third highest revenue in Southern Railways and 45% of Salem division\u2019s, the organisation pointed out. In the area of Station Infrastructure, the organisation sought redevelopment of Coimbatore Junction at the earliest under EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) mode; and expansion of Coimbatore North Junction with construction of two additional platforms with entry from Mettupalayam Road, alongside the development of passenger amenities and train originating/ terminating facilities. The current goods depot should be relocated to Peelamedu or Irugur due to its central city location, the memorandum said. The LUB called for enhancements at Irugur Junction by way of increasing platform length and height, a foot overbridge and improved lighting and toilet facilities. On creation of facilities for train maintenance, the LUB drew the attention of the Minister to the long-pending proposals for establishing additional pit lines, stabling lines, and coaching facilities; and sought implementation of a state-of-the-art signalling system and the installation of Kavach in Coimbatore. In the area of train services, the organisation requested for introduction of a Vande Bharat train service from Coimbatore to Tiruvananthapuram via Ernakulam; introduction of new superfast services and restoration of metre gauge services from Coimbatore to Patna, Kolkata, Thiruchendur, and Sengottai; besides increasing frequency of the services to Delhi (Kongu Express), Jabalpur, Rameswaram (via Trichy), Tirunelveli (via Palani), and a circular train service around Coimbatore city using existing infrastructure and creating new halt stations at locations such as Airport, Tidel Park, Nanjundapuram, Singanallur, and Ondipudur. The LUB-TN underscored the scope for scaling up cargo business through establishment of a new cargo terminal on the vacant land available at Nallampalayam, north of Coimbatore city; enhancing facilities for loading and unloading with the provision of cranes and forklifts; relocation of Goods Shed from Coimbatore North and Peelamedu to the new Multi-Modal Logistics Park in the Irugur area; and early completion of the third and fourth lines between Jolarpettai, Coimbatore, and Shoranur to foster the development of Western Tamil Nadu. The ongoing track enhancement between Jolarpettai and Coimbatore should be fast-tracked to achieve 130 kmph. Restoration and doubling of the 1.2 km link line between Coimbatore-Podanur and Irugur-Podanur would facilitate unidirectional movement from Coimbatore Junction. Additionally, doubling the line from Mettupalayam to Coimbatore North would contribute to regional development. An Elevated Railway Corridor of approximately 10 km between Madukkarai nd Kanjikode on the Coimbatore-Shoranur section\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 line would help prevent wildlife casualties, particularly elephants. The \u2018B\u2019 line in this section posed a significant threat to the ecosystem, the Memorandum said. According to the delegation, the Railway Minister gave an assurance to consider the demands..

            "content": "Kylian Mbappe has hogged the headlines in the football arena. Reportedly, Neymar, his former PSG teammate, has warned his Brazil teammates at Real Madrid on playing with the France superstar. Mbappe recently signed a five-year contract with Real Madrid ending his eight-year association with Paris Saint Germain (PSG). For the unversed, Neymar and Mbappe played together at PSG from 2017 to 2023 and reportedly, there was notable tension all the time between the two high-profile players. The duo together racked up 54 goal combinations but Neymar doesn't seem to have enjoyed playing with the France international. Journalist Cyril Hanouna, while speaking to Europe 1, has revealed that the renowned Brazil football player has sent a warning to the likes of Vinicius Jr and other Brazilian contingent at Madrid terming his experience of playing with Mbappe as 'hell'. \"The Brazilians [at Real Madrid] are friends with Neymar. It has always been a war between Neymar and Mbappe\u0301. Neymar has sent a paper about Mbappe\u0301 to the Brazilians, telling them that it was catastrophic, that it was hell,\" Hanouna said. Interestingly, Mbappe and Neymar were joined by Lionel Messi at PSG in 2021 and it was expected that the trio would do magical things together. But nothing as such happened as they adapted to different styles. Neymar left PSG in 2023 to join Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal while Messi's association with PSG didn't last for more than two years as he signed Inter Miami in 2023. Mbappe's exit ended his eight-year-long stay with PSG, not on a happy note. However, the France international was the top player for them over the years having scored 256 goals (an all-time highest for the club) and also won a staggering 17 trophies with the club. Meanwhile, in his most recent appearance for Real Madrid, Kylian Mbappe also scored a goal in the 75th minute against Real Sociedad in La Liga to help his team win the match 2-0. Overall, he has scored three goals for his new club and will be aiming to continue performing well for the team.",

Verstappen, whose dominance in 2022 and 2023 broke records, still leads the standings but his last win was in June.I think this is the best season I can think of ever in Formula 1 since I've been here,\" Brown told The Associated Press from the IndyCar season finale at Nashville Superspeedway in Tennessee.Could it even be better than the 2021 fight between Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, which was decided on the final lap of the year and helped fuel F1's Netflix boom? Brown thinks it might be.That was mega exciting, but it's just two guys, two good guys. Now you've got four good teams in today'",

            "content": "The \u201cgirivalam\u201d at Thanjavur, an initiative reportedly undertaken by a Sivanadiyar group in Thanjavur a few years ago, is all set to be revived from September 17 \u2013 the \u201cPuratasi first Pournami\u201d day \u2013 with the support of government departments and the civic body. A group of devotees sponsoring the Pradosha Pujai at Sri Brahadeeswarar temple, popularly known as the Big Temple, twice a month, had taken up a similar initiative about six years ago. The interest among devotees who embarked on the \u201cgirivalam\u201d on the full moon day by going around the Big Temple complex gradually waned because of the poor illumination facility along the ramparts of the fortified World Heritage Monument, sources said. Claiming that the practice of going around the Big Temple under the moonlight on full moon day was in vogue in the recent past, R. Ravichandran, director, Azhagiya Thanjai \u2013 2005, an organisation involved in creating awareness of historical and cultural importance of the town, said it had been proposed to allow people to do circumambulation of Sri Brahadeeswarar temple through the outermost corridor of the complex from 5 p.m. on full moon day to 6 a.m. the following day. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting held at the Thanjavur Corporation headquarters in which government officials, those from the Archaeological Survey of India and the police participated. While the civic body assured the meeting that arrangements would be made for better illumination of the girivalam path abutting the ramparts along the Grand Anicut Canal on the South and the Seppanavari on the West, the police said they would tighten security arrangements. Meanwhile, a section of senior citizens in the town said they had not heard of such \u201cgirivalam\u201d practice during their younger days. Probably, a belief that the Rajarajeswaram (Big Temple) itself was a Mahameru (a sacred cosmological mountain with five peaks in Hindu cosmology which is considered to be the centre of all the physical, metaphysical and spiritual universes) might have influenced the organisers of the \u201cgirivalam\u201d event to promote the circumambulation on full moon day, they added.

            "content": "The city railway police have registered a cheating and forgery case against two employees of Indian Railways, who allegedly tried to get six berths reserved by forging a recommendation letter purportedly from the office of the Minister of State for Railways two years ago. Based on a complaint by R. Ramanathan, Chief Reservation Supervisor, the police booked Jackson Stalin and Jitendra Kumar recently for further investigation. Mr. Ramanathan in July 2022 received a request from the office of then Minister of State for Railways Raosaheb Patil Danve, containing six passenger name record numbers (PNRs) for the release of head office quota for Train No. 12295 Sanghamitra Express that had already been allotted. The request was sent to the Commercial Controller, Chennai, who sought to verify the veracity of the request. The office of the Minister of State for Railways said that the request had not originated from there and that it was fake. Meanwhile, the vigilance branch of South-Western Railway had referred the case for a fact-finding inquiry to the Railway Protection Force, Bengaluru division, on the advice of the Railway Board. The inquiry had revealed an organised racket of obtaining confirmed berths through the head office quota with the involvement of Jackson Stalin and Jitendra Kumar in collusion with outsiders through forgery and impersonation of VIPs and other officials of the Railways.

            "content": "Australia have called up their U19 World Cup star Mahli Beardman in their squad for the five-match ODI series against England as a standby player. The Aussies are looking to address the injury issues of their fast bowlers. Beardman was the Player of the Match of the U19 World Cup 2024 final against India as he picked 3/15 in Australia's victory. He is among the speedsters on whom the cricket board is keeping an eye alongside Callum Vidler, Charlie Anderson and Tom Straker. The Aussies are facing injury issues to their fast-bowling stocks. The likes of Xavier Bartlett, Nathan Ellis, Spencer Johnson and Riley Meredith have picked up injuries recently. Bartlett was ruled out of the England T20Is after a side strain in the first T20I against the Three Lions. Ellis was pulled from Australia's tour of Scotland after compounding his injury in The Hundred. Johnson and Meredith also sustained side issues with the former missing the whole Scotland series and the latter only playing in the first T20I. is not in the team too as he is building up for the five-match Test series against India later in the year, while Josh Hazlewood is being closely monitored after a calf issue saw him miss the Scotland series. Australia are taking caution for their big three (Hazlewood, Cummins and Mitchell Starc) ahead of the India Tests. \"A lot of our priorities will be geared around that. You'll see that unfold with the management of our players. We'll be very pointed around who does what in terms of [Sheffield] Shield cricket coming into the summer to make sure that they are ready for that first Test match,\" Australia's coach Andrew McDonald told SEN. The Aussies will be having four specialist fast bowlers for the England ODIs as Ben Dwarshuis, Starc, Hazlewood and Sean Abbott will form a four-pronged pace attack. All-rounders Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie and captain Mitch Marsh will be the other pace options available for the visitors. The series will begin on September 19 with the first ODI in Nottingham. The two teams will meet again a couple of days later in Leeds, before a face-off in Chester-Le-Street on September 24. The caravan will then head to the iconic Lord's for the fourth game on September 27, followed by the final match a couple of days later in Bristol.

Praneeth, hailed from Hyderabad's Ranga Reddy district. The student had gone on a holiday with friends and his brother to a cottage near Clear Lake in Canada on Saturday. Praneeth had moved to Canada in 2019 for his studies, followed by his elder brother in 2022. A. Ravi, the victim's father said Praneeth went swimming with his friends and brother on Sunday morning but did not return to the shore. The devastated father said he got the tragic news of Praneeth's death from one of his son's friends. The local police were notified, and Ravi mentioned that rescue teams took over 10 hours to arrive at the lake. The body was recovered in the evening. The grieving family has appealed to the government for help in bringing Praneeth\u2019s body back to India. Praneeth\u2019s father expressed deep sorrow, highlighting the tragic irony that his son\u2019s birthday celebration turned into a day of mourning. The family is seeking support to expedite the repatriation process of Praneeth\u2019s body to Hyderabad. \u201cBoth along with other friends visited the lake to celebrate the birthday of Praneeth on Saturday.

She was killed by a speeding car while crossing the road in Florida. Media reports also claimed that she celebrated her 25th birthday on May 11.

            "content": "The Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) has urged both the Central and State governments to establish a new railway station at Solar for the benefit of passengers. In a press release, party\u2019s general secretary M. Yuvaraja said that Erode, one of the fastest growing cities in the State, had reputed industries and educational institutions in large numbers. Thousands of people from across the State visited the district for various purposes, including traders for marketing turmeric and for purchasing textile products resulting in frequent traffic congestion in the city. The Erode Outer Ring Road that was established to reduce congestion was also congested. To reduce congestion on city roads, a bus terminal is being established at Solar on Karur Bypass Road. But the work is carried out at a snail\u2019s pace, he claimed and wanted the works to be expedited. He said once the new terminal became operational, movement of passengers would be very high and would need additional transportation. Hence, a new railway station near the terminal would be a permanent solution, the release said and added that required land and tracks were already available at Solar. He said the station would serve people from southern districts and also help traders to move their goods quickly. The release sought additional platforms at Erode Railway Junction, upgrade of Thottipalayam railway station and ensuring all trains stop at the station to reduce congestion at main junction. The release urged elected representatives in the district to take up the issue with the respective governments.

They also claimed that Congress activists had attacked BRS leaders in Khammam during their visit to flood-hit areas, attacked the camp office of T. Harish Rao at Siddipet and killed BRS activist B. Sridhar Reddy in Kollapur constituency. Mr. Vivekanand Goud alleged that the Chief Minister had betrayed people badly on all the pre-poll promises after coming to power and the ruling party was resorting to attention diversion politics as they were unable to fulfil them.

He also highlighted that the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019 (section rule 62 regarding Telecommunication Structures), required applicants to submit a structural safety and stability certificate. This certificate must confirm the safety of both the telecom structure and the building on which it would be installed. He alleged that even with the policy in place, not all telecom service providers were obtaining the required permissions. Additionally, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation officials were unaware of the rules, leading to power connections being provided to telecom towers without necessary approvals. \u201cDespite the 2022 Government Order, over 100 mobile towers in Coimbatore Corporation limits alone have received electricity connections without approval in the past two years,\u201d Mr. Kathirmathiyon claimed. He urged the Collector to ensure that all telecom service providers obtained the necessary permissions as per the rules and that these instructions were strictly enforced. When contacted, Collector Kranthi Kumar Pati said, \u201cWe verify all the applications we receive and grant approval only if they meet all the necessary requirements. Moving forward, we will inform all telecom service providers of the need for proper permissions and enforce the rules more strictly.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 06:43 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Coimbatore / telecommunication service / telecommunication equipment",

            "content": "The depth of the Telugu language was brought to the fore by the different Telugu inscriptions of dynasties and periods since 400 BCE, according to Gorantla-based historian and writer MyNaa Swamy. As the keynote speaker at the \u2018Summit of Telugu Authors and Poets\u2019 held at the SPVM College at Gorantla of Sri Sathya Sai district on Monday, Mr. Swamy appealed to students interested in historical studies to create an abundance of short stories, essays, and poems in the Telugu language. He highlighted the presence of Telugu words in valuable historical sources such as the Kubheeraka inscription (400 BCE) in Bhattiprolu of Andhra Pradesh, the Mahendra-1 inscription (610 CE) at the Tiruchirapalli (TN) cave temple, the Telugu Chola Dhananjay\u2019s inscription (575 CE) at Kalamalla of Kadapa district, the II Bukka Raya\u2019s inscription (1388 CE) at Mereddipalli, and Sri Krishna Deva Raya\u2019s inscription (1524 CE) in Gorantla\u2019s Madhavaraya Swamy Temple. \u201cNumerous Telugu inscriptions serve as living examples of the richness of the language and culture,\u201d he added, while explaining the evolution of the Telugu language and culture during the Vijayanagara (Hampi) dynasty. Author Kalluru Raghavendra Rao said that students were more inclined towards technical education than traditional education, emphasising the importance of parents preserving the mother tongue. Poets and writers from across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana attended the event. Published - September 16, 2024 06:36 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Escorted by a pilot police vehicle, around 30 medics arrived at Ms. Banerjee's residence at 6.20 pm. The meeting was originally scheduled at 5 pm. Before departing from their sit-in spot outside Swasthya Bhavan, the health department headquarters, the protesters said they are being accompanied by two professional stenographers to record the minutes of the meeting. The protesters said they would not settle for anything less than the five demands they had previously placed before the government. The medics demanded accountability and punishment for those responsible for the rape-murder of a postgraduate trainee in RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9 and \"destruction\" of evidence; strict action against the former medical college principal Sandip Ghosh; resignation of Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal and Health Secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam; improved security for healthcare workers; and the eradication of the \"threat culture\" in government healthcare institutions.

The event aims to position Mysuru as a prominent global hub for Deeptech, Cybersecurity, AI/ML, talent supply, ESDM, and GCC destinations. The objective of the event is to attract more investments, promote the establishment of new enterprises, and create an environment conducive to sustaining existing businesses along with skilled talent supply. The event will witness the participation of over 450 delegates, 45 global speakers, 60 students, six country partners, 15 colleges, 25 startup display booths and incubators, and media and technology stakeholders, a press release said. The Big Tech Show-2024 was announced last month when the State government along with Karnataka Digital Economy Mission (KDEM), and India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) conducted the first-ever ESDM Tech Yatra (Electronic System Design and Manufacturing) in Mysuru. It is an initiative to showcase the readiness of the Mysuru cluster to the ESDM world and drive a potential investment pipeline into the cluster along with talent sourcing. Efforts are on to position Mysuru as a hub for ESDM. The government aims to elevate Karnataka\u2019s ESDM sector globally by fostering collaboration among industry, startups, and academia, showcasing Bengaluru-Mysuru corridor as a premier technology hub. During the ESDM Tech Yatra here last month, the event highlighted the business potential and the organisers said the sector would attract significant investments exceeding \u20b91,000 crore and generate over 5,000 new jobs, creating numerous job opportunities, promoting local innovation, and enhancing the sector\u2019s global brand. They said it will drive economic growth and position Mysuru as a Centre for Technological Advancement. ESDM driven activities in the Bengaluru-Mysuru corridor were being pushed with Bengaluru projected as a design hub and Mysuru as a manufacturing hub.

            "content": "A video of an ASI in Madhya Pradesh Police went viral on social media in which he is seen putting off his uniform after councillor's husband threatened him by saying - wardi utarva dunga (will strip your uniform). In the viral video, an ASI is seen taking off his uniform in front of senior police personnel and municipal corporation officials in the police station. Everyone was stunned seeing ASI's reaction. The video that went viral on social media is said to be of February 2, 2024, i.e. 7 months old. 7 months ago, there was a dispute between ASI Vinod Mishra of Kotwali police station and locals regarding the construction of drain in the Kotwali police station area of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bthe district. After the dispute, the officials of the municipal corporation and the police officials inspected the spot and everyone reached the Kotwali police station to resolve the matter. While there was a discussion about resolving the dispute in the police station, BJP leader and councilor's husband Arjun Gupta threatened ASI Vinod Mishra to strip his uniform. Due to this, the ASI lost his temper and took off his uniform in front of everyone. The incident was captured in the CCTV camera installed in the police station. After the incident, SP Nivedita Gupta took action against the ASI for tearing the uniform. Surprisingly, after 7 months, this matter once again revived. Currently, on this entire matter, the SP ordered an investigation into the matter of leaking the CCTV footage of the police station and making the video viral on social media. After the video went viral, politics was also on the rise in this matter. MP Congress wrote on the social media handle X, \"This is the power of authority...look at the threat of the BJP councillor...a uniformed man had to tear his uniform!! The level of policing in the state has reached zero! Crime is out of control, criminals are fearless and the police is helpless at some places and under pressure at others.\"",

            "content": "The 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election is likely to see another Thackeray family member entering the fray as Amit Thackeray, son of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, has expressed his desire to contest the upcoming polls. This was revealed during a party meeting held on Monday (September 16). Sources indicate that Amit Thackeray, currently serving as the President of the Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena, expressed his interest in contesting the election himself. He also urged prominent party leaders to enter the election battlefield during what is expected to be a highly watched assembly poll. While sources suggested that Amit Thackeray may contest from the Mahim, Bhandup, or Magathane Assembly Constituencies in Mumbai, a final decision on his political debut will be made once Raj Thackeray gives his confirmation. Amit Thackeray, responding to calls from party leaders urging him to run, has stated that he is ready to contest from any constituency. Notably, in July, MNS chief Raj Thackeray announced that his party would go solo in the Maharashtra Assembly elections. \"We will fight 200 to 250 seats in the state elections,\" Raj Thackeray said.

            "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has deleted an , wherein he questioned why there were no attempts to kill US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. His controversial comment on the social media platform, X, came hours after former US President Donald Trump's apparent second assassination attempt. \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala\". The insensitive post came in response to a query from an X user with the handle @cb_doge, who asked why the former President was being targeted. After facing huge backlash on social media, Musk, who is also a good friend of Trump, deleted the post and wrote, \"Well, one lesson I have learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh, it doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X.\" Trump was the target of what the FBI said \"appears to be an attempted assassination\" at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on September 15, just nine weeks after the Republican presidential nominee survived another attempt on his life. The former president said he was safe and well, and authorities held a man in custody. CNN, Fox News and The New York Times identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. On April 21, Routh directed an X message to Elon Musk, in which he wrote: \"I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putin's Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please.\" The New York Times reported it had interviewed Routh in 2023 for an article about Americans who were volunteering to help the Ukraine war effort. Routh told the Times he'd travelled to Ukraine and spent several months there in 2022 and was trying to recruit Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. Earlier this year, Routh tagged Biden in a post on X: \"@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. (With inputs from agencies)",

            "content": "Bollywood star Govinda's wife, Sunita Ahuja, recounted a shocking incident on a podcast where a fan, disguised as a maid, lived with them for nearly three weeks to be close to Govinda. New Delhi: Bollywood icon Govinda, renowned for his blockbuster hits like 'Coolie No. 1', 'Hero No. 1' and 'Aunty No. 1', has been at the center of an astonishing story involving one of his most devoted fans. In a recent episode of the popular podcast 'Timeout with Ankit,' Sunita Ahuja, Govinda's wife, revealed a bizarre incident where a fan disguised herself as a maid and lived with the couple for nearly three weeks. Watch The Podcast Here: According to Sunita Ahuja, the situation began when a young woman, who was an ardent admirer of Govinda, managed to infiltrate their household by posing as a domestic worker. \"Ek ladki toh bai ban kar aa gyi idhar sa**li ghar pe,\" Sunita recounted during the podcast. She described how the girl appeared out of place with her cleaning skills, which prompted Sunita to question her authenticity. \"Maine bola yaar ye toh acche ghar ki ladki hai, maine apni mother-in-law ko bola ki isko toh bartan ghasne ko nhi aata hai, jhaadoo bartan nhi aata hai,\" Sunita explained. Further investigations revealed the girl\u2019s true identity and her extraordinary admiration for Govinda. Sunita shared, \"Mera toh dimaag satak gaya, jitna bhi choti hu mai, maine bola ye bartan nhi maangh skti hai, na hi isse jhadoo ho rahe hain.\" The discovery was made even more shocking when Sunita learned that the girl was the daughter of a minister and had managed to live with them for an extended period purely out of her admiration for Govinda. Sunita detailed the girl's unusual behavior, noting that she would stay up late into the night, ostensibly to catch a glimpse of Govinda. \"Dekho toh, mai raat ko jaagna kaha, ye raat ko Govinda ke liye jaagi hai,\" Sunita remarked. The situation only came to light after Sunita's mother-in-law also became suspicious and urged further inquiry. Eventually, the truth emerged when the young woman broke down and admitted her identity. \"Fir meri mother-in-law bhi boli 'pata kro ye ladki kaun hai?' Fir vo roo roo ke boli ki mai inki fan hu,\" Sunita said. The fan\u2019s revelation led to an influx of political figures, including several cars, as they arrived to address the unusual situation. Sunita confirmed that the fan stayed with them for about 20 days before the situation was resolved. Despite the unusual circumstances, Sunita expressed relief that nothing untoward occurred during this period. \"Mere khyaal se 20 din ruki hogi,\" she concluded, adding her gratitude that the situation was not harmful. About Govinda And Sunita Govinda and Sunita got married in 1987, a year after his Bollywood debut. Concerned that marriage might hinder his career, the couple chose to keep their union private for over a year. They publicly revealed their marriage when their daughter, Tina, celebrated her first birthday.",

            "content": "Vishwakarma Puja 2024, celebrated on September 16, honors Lord Vishwakarma, the divine architect, and holds special significance for workers, artisans, and engineers. Vishwakarma Puja, celebrated on the birth anniversary of Lord Vishwakarma, the divine architect and creator of the universe, holds great significance, especially for those in manufacturing, engineering, and artisan professions. This year, Vishwakarma Puja falls on September 16, 2024, according to the Drik Panchang. Significance of Vishwakarma Puja Vishwakarma Puja, also known as Vishwakarma Jayanti, is a Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Vishwakarma, revered as the divine architect of the universe. The festival is highly significant for professionals in various industries like manufacturing, engineering, architecture, mechanics, and artisanship. Devotees pray for blessings, seeking prosperity, safety in the workplace, and success in their respective fields. It is common for workers to worship their tools and machinery, asking for smooth operations and a productive year ahead. Date and Muhurat for Vishwakarma Puja 2024 In 2024, Vishwakarma Jayanti will be celebrated on September 16, coinciding with Bhadra Sankranti or Kanya Sankranti, the final day of the Bengali month of Bhadra. As per the Drik Panchang, the auspicious time for the puja, known as Sankranti Muhurat, is predicted to be at 7:53 PM. History of Vishwakarma Jayanti The roots of Vishwakarma Jayanti trace back to ancient Indian scriptures, including the Rigveda, one of the oldest Hindu texts, which mentions Lord Vishwakarma as the divine craftsman. Over time, the festival evolved into a significant occasion for laborers, artisans, and craftsmen to honor Lord Vishwakarma and seek his blessings for creativity, prosperity, and skill in their work. How Vishwakarma Puja is Celebrated On Vishwakarma Jayanti, professionals such as architects, carpenters, engineers, and mechanics worship their machinery, vehicles, tools, and equipment. Pujas are often performed in industrial settings or workplaces, where participants offer prayers for prosperity and smooth operations. Many choose not to use their tools or machines during the puja as a mark of respect. Vishwakarma Puja is a unique celebration that underscores the importance of craftsmanship and creativity, uniting communities of workers to honor the divine architect of the universe.",

            "description": "Economic risks for the wealthy due to climate change is growing at the fastest rates because of impacts to global supply chains and goods and services, even as the highest risks remain with the poorest around the world, according to a new study.Across countries, lower-income consumers are known to face higher economic risks in a changing climate because of a low capacity to adapt.However, researchers explained that inequality in consumption between varied income groups within a country is grounded in how easily one is able to substitute goods to adapt to the effects of climate change, including shocks to supply chains.The team from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany found that low-income consumers are more vulnerable to supply shocks as they spend a greater share of their budget on hard-to-substitute necessary goods.On the other hand, high-income consumers spent larger shares of their budget on easier-to-substitute goods so that they suffer smaller",

            "content": "Indian skipper Rohit Sharma is on the verge of two major milestones in the upcoming Test series against Bangladesh. Scroll down to check which records he can break. IND vs BAN: Indian skipper Rohit Sharma will have some milestones to chase as he prepares to take on Bangladesh in the first Test of the two-match series at Chennai from Thursday. The two-match series will kick off on September 19 in Chennai at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. The second long-format game will begin on September 27 in Kanpur. In his first Test assignment, head coach Gautam Gambhir will be keen on securing a series win. The Indian skipper has enjoyed a fine run of form in the ongoing ICC World Test Championship 2023-25 so far, scoring 700 runs in nine matches and 16 innings at an average of 46.66, with three centuries and three fifties. His best score is 131. He is the 12th highest run-getter in the competition so far. Rohit has two milestones to look for during the series. Getting to the first milestone will seal his legacy as the country's finest six-hitter. With 84 sixes in Tests, Rohit is at 11th place among top six-hitters in the world. He just needs eight more big hits to displace legendary Virender Sehwag (91) to become team's leading six-hitter in Test cricket. England skipper Ben Stokes (131), former New Zealand wicketkeeper-batter Brendon McCullum (107) and iconic Australian wicketkeeper-batter Adam Gilchrist (100) are the top three sixes in the world. If Rohit goes on a big six-hitting spree in these two games, he could also become only the fourth overall and first Indian batter to have smashed 100 sixes in Tests. The 'Hitman' is also nearing the half-centuries of centuries in international cricket. With 48 centuries in 483 matches, he is just two more tons away from reaching 50 international centuries. He will become only the third Indian batter to reach this milestone and overall 10th player to do so. Currently from India, only Sachin Tendulkar (100 centuries) and Virat Kohli (80 centuries) have crossed a half-century of centuries in international cricket. For Rohit Sharma's side, this series against Bangladesh will be followed by New Zealand's tour of India for three Tests starting from October 16, and then the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia from November 22. India's squad for the 1st Test against Bangladesh: Rohit Sharma (C), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Sarfaraz Khan, Rishabh Pant (WK), Dhruv Jurel (WK), R Ashwin, R Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Jasprit Bumrah, Yash Dayal.",

            "content": "Former Inspector-General of Police of Idol Wing CID A.G. Ponn Manickavel on Monday appeared before the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in adherence to the conditions laid down by the Madras High Court in connection with a case filed against him. The CBI had registered a case against the former police officer following an order of the Madras High Court on a petition filed by former officer Kader Batcha, who had levelled allegations against Mr. Manickavel. The CBI\u2019s case is that when Mr. Manickavel was the chief investigating officer heading the Idol Wing CID, he falsely implicated police officers including Kader Batcha as accused in a criminal case, without any evidence, by pressuring the accused in idol theft/smuggling cases to give confession statements against them. After the CBI filed the case, Mr. Manickavel moved a petition seeking advance bail. Last month, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court granted him anticipatory bail, and also imposed certain conditions on him, including a requirement that he should report before the CBI, Anti Corruption Branch, Shastri Bhawan, Chennai, at 10.30 a.m. every day for four weeks, and thereafter as and when required, for interrogation. Complying with the conditions, Mr. Manickavel on Monday appeared before the CBI officer concerned and signed on the register.

            "content": "The largest and heaviest coin in the world is called Rai, or Yapese stone money, and it is found on the island of Yap in Micronesia. Some of these enormous limestone disks have a mass of over 4,000 pounds and a diameter of 12 feet. They are employed in ceremonies and cultural contexts as status and riches symbols. They are a distinctive feature of Yapese society and are still used for transactions despite their size. One of the world's most unusual currencies, the Rai stone, is found on the tiny island of Yap in the Pacific Ocean. The money on this Micronesian island is constructed of enormous limestone discs, some of which weigh up to several tons and have a diameter of more than 12 feet, in contrast to conventional coins or banknotes. Not only are these \"coins\" the biggest and heaviest in the world, but they also symbolize an intriguing cultural custom that is ingrained in Yap's past. Where Did Rai Stones Come From? The Yapese started removing stones from the island of Palau, which is located more than 250 miles away, in 500 AD, which is when the Rai stones first appeared. It was no easy task to move these enormous stones across the ocean; frequently, a whole crew of locals and big canoes were needed. The labor-intensive and hazardous nature of the process raised the value of the stones. Remarkably, a stone's value isn't always determined by its size. Rather, the stone's past\u2014including how challenging it was to transport, whether any lives were lost in the process, and how old it is\u2014determines its value. Because of their historical significance, the Rai stones are more than just a means of exchange; they are status and prestige markers. How Rai Stones Operate as Money Even though it may be difficult to imagine, the Yapese have created a special system for employing enormous stones as money. Seldom do the stones physically exchange hands. Rather, ownership is passed down orally, and the stones stay in the same spot for many years. Every member of the community is aware of who owns which stone, and decisions are made based on this shared understanding. The Importance of Culture The Rai stones are more valuable than money since they are a part of Yap society's social and political structure. Though most daily transactions now utilize contemporary currency, the stones are still used today in some traditional ceremonies and as a sign of riches. Yap's enormous Rai stones are still an amazing representation of the island's culture and provide insight into the unusual ways in which communities may assign value.",

While baking soda exfoliates and balances the pH of the skin, coconut oil hydrates, minimizing wrinkles and fine lines for more youthful, smooth skin. Many people want youthful, bright skin, and while there are a gazillion lotions, serums, and treatments available, often the best answers can be found in nature. A straightforward, two-ingredient coconut oil mixture that claims to remove wrinkles in just seven days is one such cure that is becoming more and more well-liked. What's superior than that? These ingredients are probably already in your kitchen. Coconut Oil Power For a long time, coconut oil has been promoted as a skincare and cosmetic miracle worker. Because of its rich fatty acid and antioxidant content, it is an effective moisturizer that profoundly nourishes the skin. Coconut oil, which is high in lauric acid and vitamin E, penetrates the skin's layers to help with damage healing, elasticity improvement, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. While coconut oil is good on its own, its anti-aging effects can be enhanced when combined with another potent component. The Secret Ingredient: Baking Soda Baking soda is the second ingredient in this wonder mixture that reduces wrinkles. Baking soda is well known for its exfoliating qualities, which aid in removing dead skin cells to reveal smoother, younger skin. In addition, it lowers inflammation, restores the pH balance of the skin, and helps lessen the visibility of blemishes, dark spots, and other aging symptoms. The Baking Soda Mix Recipe with Coconut Oil It's easy to make this wrinkle-fighting concoction. In a small bowl, combine half a teaspoon of baking soda with one tablespoon of organic coconut oil. Mix until a uniform, smooth paste forms. Apply the mixture to your face, paying particular attention to wrinkles and fine lines. After giving it a few minutes of light circular massage, let it sit for ten to fifteen minutes before rinsing it off with warm water. Results You Can See in Just 7 Days This mixture of coconut oil and baking soda can make your skin feel softer, smoother, and visibly younger with continued usage. Many consumers have noted a noticeable decrease in the look in just seven days. Try this easy, all-natural cure, and see your skin glow with youthful health.",

            "content": "The Toronto International Film Festival's People's Choice Award went to The Life of Chuck , handing Mike Flanagan's Stephen King adaptation one of the most-watched prizes of the fall film festival circuit. The award for The Life of Chuck was announced on Sunday (September 15, 2024) as North American's largest film festival drew to a close. The Life of Chuck, based on King's 2020 novella of the same name, stars Tom Hiddleston as Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Krantz, an ordinary man living through apocalyptic cataclysms. Mark Hamill, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan and Jacob Tremblay co-star. TIFF's People's Choice Award is regarded as a reliable Oscar harbinger. Since 2012, every winner of the festival's top prize has gone on to be nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards. Last year, Cord Jefferson's American Fiction won, and went on to be a major awards contender. But The Life of Chuck could test that track record. The film is up for sale and doesn't yet have distribution. It could be acquired and quickly readied for release this fall, or it might end up a 2025 release. The Life of Chuck drew mixed \u2014 though mostly positive reviews \u2014 out of Toronto, though audiences were clearly charmed by the uplifting drama. Runners-up for the People's Choice Award, which is voted on by festival attendees, were both films that first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The first was Jacques Audiard's Emilia Pe\u0301rez. The second runner-up was Sean Baker's Anora , the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes .

In the festival's Midnight Madness section, the prize went to Coralie Fargeat's The Substance , starring Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley.

            "content": "India\u2019s 100th year at the Olympics is the muse of artists commissioned by JSW Foundation \u2014 the social development arm of the JSW Group \u2014 to create a total of four artworks. In collaboration with Karishma Swali, director of Chanakya School of Craft, and artist Sujata Bajaj, the foundation attempts at exploring India\u2019s recent wins at the sports gala and celebrating its association with France, which is now hosting Paralympics Games Paris 2024. While Karishma Swali and Chanakya School of Craft have shouldered the curation and execution of three artworks strung on the theme Citius\u2014Altius\u2014Fortius (stronger, higher, faster, together), the one created by Sujata Bajaj, who shares her career history with Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, is an ode to the shared cultural symbols of India and France. \u201cThe artworks were first revealed at the Town Hall in Paris where we co-hosted a dinner with the Indian Olympic Association and its President Dr. P.T. Usha for the Indian athletes at the Paris Olympic\u201924. The artworks will be part of the corporate collection of the JSW Group,\u201d says Sangita Jindal, chairperson of JSW Foundation. She adds that the works were commissioned in 2023 and made over the course of several months. Sakshi Malik\u2019s groundbreaking bronze in wrestling| Photo Credit:Special arrangement Alongside the central piece featuring Olympic torch and a wreath, artworks created by Chanakya School of Craft depict Olympians Neeraj Chopra and Sakshi Malik. \u201cThe decision to feature Sakshi Malik and Neeraj Chopra was guided by their recent groundbreaking accomplishments that have inspired a new generation of athletes. Sakshi\u2019s historic bronze in wrestling at the 2016 Rio Olympics and Neeraj\u2019s gold in javelin at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics align with the broader narrative of India\u2019s evolving presence on the global sports stage. Their achievements represent the spirit of breaking new ground, much like the innovative techniques and artistic expressions we employed in this collaboration,\u201d says Karishma. In fact, the JSW Foundation has gifted the artwork showcasing Olympic winner Neeraj Chopra to the athlete after he bagged the silver medal in men\u2019s javelin throw this year. Neeraj Chopra\u2019s historic gold in javelin| Photo Credit:Special arrangement The three interdisciplinary artworks have been made with intricate hand embroidery techniques. Karishma explains, \u201cWe chose vibrant yet grounded colours to evoke the energy and passion of the athletes, while also paying homage to India\u2019s rich textile heritage. The silhouettes are fluid, capturing the dynamic movements of sports and the subtle grace of craft. The works are handcrafted using a variety of materials and needlepoint techniques, such as couching, bullion knots, running stitch, crochet, and stem stitch, complemented by carpet-weaving methods like hand-knotting and hand-tufting\u201d. Over 20 artisans, each with expertise in different embroidery and weaving techniques, contributed to the crafting of these pieces.

The vibrant colours of the French and Indian flags \u2014 orange, green, blue, white and red \u2014 feature prominently. \u201cThe painting uses acrylic paints on canvas with added gold and silver foiling. The painting technique involves a lot of overlapping fluidity, which can be interpreted as an absence of boundaries,\u201d says Sujata while adding that it took about a month of working around the clock to complete the artwork. Sujata Bajaj\u2019s Artwork| Photo Credit:Special arrangement Interestingly, once upon a time there used to be a fine arts segment included in the Olympic Games, says Sujata. \u201cIn a way, the JSW event including creativity in such a prominent way could be seen as a commemoration of this. A connection that can be made between art and sport is that they both transcend borders in nature and in practice. It is a performance which can be experienced by anyone regardless of language, requiring nothing else than willingness to absorb passion and expression. My canvas is an embodiment of this,\u201d she shares. The artworks are not for sale and will be part of the corporate collection of the JSW Group.

            "content": "Skipper Harmanpreet Singh\u2019s sublime form resulted in twin strikes as defending champions India entered the final of the Asian Champions Trophy with a clinical 4-1 win against South Korea in the semifinal in Hulunbuir on Monday (September 16, 2024). India scored through Uttam Singh (13th minute), skipper Harmanpreet Singh (19th, 45th) and Jarmanpreet Singh (32nd), while Korea\u2019s lone goal came from through Yang Jihun (33rd)\u2018s penalty corner conversion. India will take on hosts China in Tuesday\u2019s final. Earlier in the day, China defeated Pakistan 2-0 via shoot-out in the first semifinal after the two teams finished 1-1 at the end of regulation 60 minutes. In the previous league stage encounter between the two finalists, India prevailed 3-0. Pakistan and Korea will face off in the third place classification match which will also be played on Tuesday. Meanwhile in the fifth-sixth place classification match, Japan beat Malaysia 4-2 in shoot-out following a 4-4 stalemate in normal time. In the second semifinal as expected, the Indians started on the offensive and tested the Korean defence with persistent attacks from the word go. The Koreans, on the other hand, were contend to sit back and defend and rely on sporadic counter attacks. Abhishek came tantalisingly close to handing India the lead in the fourth minute but his reverse hit was brilliantly saved by Korean goalkeeper Kim Jaehan. The Indian made promising build ups and penetrated the Korean circle on consistent basis in the first quarter. India\u2019s attacking intent finally paid of in the 13th minute when Uttam positioned himself at the right place at the right time to tap in Araijeet Singh Hundal\u2019s supply from the right. A minute from the first break, Korea secured back-to-back penalty corners but failed to utilise the chances. Four minutes into the second quarter, India secured their first penalty corner and Harmanpreet scored his sixth goal of the tournament to hand his side a 2-0 lead. At the stroke of half-time, custodian Suraj Karkera came out of his line to save an effort from the opposition player. India continued in the same vein after the change of ends and extended their lead two minutes into the third quarter. A brilliant scoop from Sumit from the right finds Jarmanpreet just outside the circle on the left flank and the latter neatly collected the ball and took a step or two to get inside the circle and slap the ball into the Korean goal to extend India\u2019s lead. But Korea pulled one back a minute later from a penalty corner through the tournament\u2019s top-scorer Yang Jihun. The goal hardly bothered the Indians as they continued their attacking game and dominated the share of exchanges. With a second left for the third quarter, India secured another penalty corner when Korean goalkeeper Jaehan was shown the yellow card for handling the ball out side the circle, and Harmanpreet made no mistake to extend the lead. Eight minutes from the final hooter, India\u2019s second goalkeeper Karkera made a fine double save to deny Park Cheoleon, but the Koreans secured a penalty corner which went in vain. Thereafter, it was controlled show from the Indians as they defended their lead with consummate ease to march into their fifth final appearance in the tournament.

            "content": "The last time fans saw Dhoni in action was back during the IPL 2024 game between RCB and CSK. His future in the cash-rich league is still under the scanner as the Ranchi-based cricketer has not provided any statement on his retirement. Former India skipper MS Dhoni was spotted enjoying his off time after the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. The wicketkeeper batter was seen spending time with friends in the USA and he also attended a game of American football. A picture of the same went viral on social media the moment it got shared by one of Dhoni\u2019s friends. The former India skipper seemed happy as he posed for photographs with his friends. The last time fans saw Dhoni in action was back during the IPL 2024 game between RCB and CSK. His future in the cash-rich league is still under the scanner as the Ranchi-based cricketer has not provided any statement on his retirement. A post shared by Hitesh Sanghvi (@hitesh412740) A post shared by Whistle Podu Army (@whistlepoduarmy) Earlier, while taking part in an event, Dhoni stated that he will do what is best for the team. The IPL governing council on the other hand is yet to announce the retention rules for the upcoming season of the competition. The umping edition of the IPL will see a mega auction where the teams will have to name their retained players. The IPL retention regulations are likely to play a huge role in Dhoni\u2019s future with the CSK as they will have to release their top players if they want to retain the legendary player. \u201cThere is a lot of time for it. We have to see what decision they take on player retention etc. Right now, the ball is not in our court. So, once the rules and regulations get formalised, I will take a call, but needs to be in the best interest of the team,\u201d said Dhoni. Talking about Dhoni\u2019s IPL career, the former CSK skipper has smashed 24 half-centuries, with his highest IPL score being 84* runs. The former India player collected 363 fours and 252 sixes in his IPL career.",

            "content": "World Ozone Day, celebrated on September 16th, raises awareness about the importance of the ozone layer and global efforts to protect it through the Montreal Protocol. World Ozone Day , observed on September 16th each year, marks the anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987. This day is dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of the ozone layer and the actions needed to preserve it. The ozone layer acts as Earth's protective shield, absorbing the majority of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation , which can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and other health issues, as well as damage crops and marine ecosystems. What is the Ozone Layer? The ozone layer is a thin part of Earth's atmosphere, located in the stratosphere, that contains high concentrations of ozone (O3) molecules . This layer absorbs the majority of the sun\u2019s harmful UV-B and UV-C rays, preventing them from reaching the Earth's surface. Without this protective barrier, life on Earth would be exposed to severe radiation, which could have catastrophic consequences for humans, animals, and plants. The Montreal Protocol: A Landmark Environmental Agreement World Ozone Day commemorates the Montreal Protocol, a global treaty designed to phase out the production and consumption of substances that deplete the ozone layer, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons. Since its adoption, the Protocol has been a resounding success, with nearly 99% of ozone-depleting substances eliminated globally. Due to the collective global effort, the ozone layer has shown signs of recovery. According to reports, it is expected to return to pre-1980 levels by the middle of the century if current policies are maintained. The Montreal Protocol is often hailed as one of the most successful international environmental agreements in history. The Importance of Protecting the Ozone Layer The depletion of the ozone layer is not just an environmental issue but a public health concern. A thinning ozone layer means more UV radiation reaches the Earth, increasing the risk of skin cancer and cataracts in humans. It also negatively affects plant growth, reducing agricultural productivity, and harms marine life, particularly plankton, which is a vital part of the ocean's food chain. By reducing ozone-depleting substances, we also indirectly contribute to the fight against climate change. Many of the chemicals that destroy the ozone layer are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. The Montreal Protocol has, in effect, prevented significant carbon emissions, thereby helping to slow the pace of climate change. How Can We Contribute? While the Montreal Protocol has been a success, the work is far from over. On World Ozone Day, individuals, businesses, and governments can take the following steps to contribute to ozone protection: 1. Avoid the use of products containing ozone-depleting chemicals: Many old appliances and products, like refrigerators and air conditioners, still contain CFCs or other harmful substances. Replace them with environmentally friendly alternatives. 2. Support renewable energy: Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels decreases greenhouse gas emissions and promotes a healthier environment, which in turn supports ozone recovery. 3. Promote awareness and education: Educating others about the importance of the ozone layer and the steps being taken to protect it can encourage responsible behavior and decision-making. 4. Conserve energy: Using less energy reduces demand for fossil fuels, cutting down on pollutants that can harm the ozone layer and contribute to climate change. The Theme of World Ozone Day 2024 Each year, World Ozone Day has a specific theme to highlight different aspects of ozone protection. The theme for World Ozone Day 2024 is \u2018Montreal Protocol: Healing the Ozone Layer for a Healthier Planet\u2019. This theme highlights the continued importance of the Montreal Protocol in global efforts to protect the ozone layer and emphasizes the need for sustained action to ensure its recovery. World Ozone Day serves as a reminder of the remarkable progress made under the Montreal Protocol and the critical importance of protecting the ozone layer for future generations. As global citizens, it is our responsibility to support initiatives that safeguard the environment and help heal the ozone layer, ensuring a healthier and safer planet for all.",

            "content": "Despite Monday (September 16, 2024) being a holiday for Milad-Un-Nabi, Hyderabad saw significant traffic congestion in various parts of the city during the afternoon and evening. With the Ganesh immersion scheduled for Tuesday (September 17, 2024) traffic is expected to increase from Monday night through Tuesday evening. While the morning saw relatively smooth traffic at Tank Bund , the situation changed by the afternoon. Due to the ninth day of Ganesh immersion, heavy traffic built up, causing slow-moving vehicles on all roads leading to Tank Bund. The stretch from People\u2019s Plaza to PVNR Marg was especially congested, with large trucks carrying Ganesh idols for immersion. These trucks were lined up bumper-to-bumper, with some carrying devotees who sang devotional songs and played music. Massive cranes were arranged at People\u2019s Plaza at Necklace Road in Hyderabad for immersion of Ganesh Idols on Monday (September 16, 2024).| Photo Credit:RAMAKRISHNA G \u201cI left for the office in the morning, taking the route from Tarnaka to Steel Bridge on my way to Banjara Hills, and the roads were mostly empty,\u201d said Ayush, an architectural trainee from Habsiguda. \u201cHowever, when I returned around 3 p.m., the situation was completely different\u2014Lakdikapul and the Telugu Talli flyover were both jam-packed with traffic.\u201d he said. Long haul trucks carrying Ganesh idols wait in serpentine queue on Necklace road for immersion of the idols in Hussain Sagar, Hyderabad on Monday (September 16, 2024).| Photo Credit:RAMAKRISHNA G At the same time, other parts of the city also experienced traffic as empty trucks and vehicles returned from the immersion process. Slow-moving traffic was reported from AR Petrol Pump, Gun Park, Ravindra Bharathi, and the DGP Office towards Lakdi-ka-Pul. \u201cWe started from Adikmet around 10 a.m. for the immersion of a Ganesh idol. Due to the heavy rush, it took us five hours for the immersion, and we only returned around 3 a.m.,\u201d shared Ramesh, a driver who had parked a truck in Tarnaka. A similar situation was observed in other areas where Ganesh immersions were taking place.

            "description": "\u201cBails are granted against surety bonds worth \u20b930,000 each,\u201d a news report said",
            "content": "An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Monday (September 16, 2024) ordered the immediate release of all the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) lawmakers arrested from the Parliament House following the party's power show on September 8 in Islamabad. \u201cAnti-Terrorism Court Judge Abul Hasnat Zulqarnain heard the bail pleas and granted post-arrest bail to the PTI MNAs who were taken into custody by the Islamabad police with their cases registered at the Sangjani police station,\u201d Geo News reported. \u201cThe bails were granted against surety bonds worth \u20b930,000 each,\u201d it said. Pakistan at risk of parochialism, says former PM Imran Khan During the hearing, prosecutor Raja Naveed told the court that Sunni Ittehad Council lawmaker Muhammad Ahmed Chattha is also named in the case. He requested the court against approving bails as the minimum sentence for provisions imposed in the case is three years, the channel said. \"Has anything been recovered from Sher Afzal Marwat, Ahmed Chattha and other MNAs [Member of the National Assembly]?\" the judge questioned the prosecutor. He responded to the question in the negative. Meanwhile, the court also approved the pre-arrest bail petition filed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Ali Bukhari in the case pertaining to his violation of the No Objection Certificate (NOC) and assault on police personnel during the party's rally. Following the hearing, the court issued a notice and adjourned the hearing of the case till October 1. The police arrested several leaders of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, including its chairman and around a dozen lawmakers, after the authorities accused his supporters of pelting stones at police personnel and violating the permission for the rally by over-stepping the allotted time limit by several hours. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and lawmaker Sher Afzal Marwat were also arrested from the Parliament House for allegedly violating the newly enacted public gathering law during the party\u2019s power show. Mr. Marwat had resisted the arrest and asked the police to show an arrest warrant. While Mr. Gohar was later released, Mr. Marwat was kept in custody for violating regulations devised under a new law \u2014 Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill, 2024, and also accused of clashing with police personnel on the rally day. At least 10 PTI lawmakers, who were arrested from the premises of Parliament House, were brought to the lower house on September 12 after their production orders were issued by National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq. During the rally, the PTI supporters demanded the release of their leader and warned to get him out of jail through street protests. The 71-year-old former-cricketer-turned-politician faces a slew of legal cases and has been in prison for more than a year after being sentenced in a graft case. Imran Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases. Published - September 16, 2024 05:13 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Pakistan / World / politics",

Boosts Vitality Natural sugars found in abundance in apples, such as fructose and glucose, give off a continuous energy boost without the crash that many coffees cause.

Furthermore, apple fiber lowers blood sugar and prevents unexpected rises in hunger.

            "content": "India defeated South Korea in the second semifinal of the Asian Champions Trophy 2024 on Monday, September 16. The Harmanpreet Singh-led side made light work of the Koreans to register a 4-1 win and make their way into the tournament's final for the sixth time. The Men in Blue will face hosts China in the final on Tuesday, September 17. India began well with an attack in the early minutes. Abhishek made an entry into the Korean D in the fourth minute but his effort was saved. In the very next minute, Uttam gave a good ball to Raheel, whose cut was saved by the Korean goalkeeper as they somehow managed to keep the score 0-0. But the constant attacks paid dividends when Araijeet Hundal's square pass went to Uttam Singh, who put the ball into the goal to take India 1-0 over the Koreans in the 10th minute. They kept the intensity going and found the second goal from Indian captain Harmanpreet Singh, who converted a penalty corner into a goal in the 19th minute. While the Koreans looked to challenge the defending champions a few times, there was hardly any stopping for the Men in Blue. At the start of the third quarter, Jarmanpreet found another goal. He received a brilliant aerial from Sumit and then slapped the ball past the Korean goal-saver to make it 3-0. The Koreans got on board soon off a penalty corner. Yang Ji-hun took the drag flick and sent it to the left of the Indian goalkeeper Krishan Pathak, who got a pad to the ball in an attempt to stop. But the ball deflected to the nets off his pads to get Korea on board at 3-1. The two teams traded chances for the rest of the quarter as Sukhjeet missed a sitter before Hyun Jig-wang failed to find the target when he looked for deflection in the Indian goal. India got another penalty corner in the dying moments of the third quarter and the champion drag flicker Harmanpreet stepped up again to score his second goal of the match. The final quarter saw India keep the possession superbly, defying the Koreans of any major chances and when they got a penalty corner, they did not make the most of it as the Men in Blue clinched the win. China had earlier defeated Pakistan in the first semifinal on penalties and would look to challenge the defending champions and Olympic Games bronze medallists in the final.",

            "description": "The Cabinet meeting on September 17 is likely to discuss some important issues, including the long-pending irrigation projects in the region",
            "content": "The people of Kalyana Karnataka region are pinning high hopes on the State Cabinet meeting in Kalaburagi district on September 17. They hope it will explore solutions to the long-standing problems of the most backward region in Karnataka. The last Cabinet meeting held in Kalaburagi to discuss issues related to the region was in 2014 during the first stint of Siddaramaiah as the Chief Minister. It is hard for people of the region to believe that a cabinet meeting in Kalaburagi will change things for the better any time soon, as the region had gained little from the six cabinet meetings held in the city so far. The Cabinet meeting on September 17 is likely to discuss some important issues, including the long-pending irrigation projects in the districts. Farmers leaders say that some of the projects, like Bhima lift irrigation, Amarja irrigation projection, Gandorinala irrigation project, Bennethora Project, Upper Mullamari and Lower Mullamari projects, were taken up nearly five decades ago, but are yet to be completed due to lack of political will. They also allege that some have technical flaws leading to water not reaching the tail-end farms. At the Cabinet meeting held in Kalaburagi in November 2014, a decision was taken to fill up nearly 50,000 vacant posts in various departments in Kalyana Karnataka region. Ministers had assured to complete the recruitment process by June 2015. However, the decision is yet to be implemented. As of now, nearly 1,09,416 posts were sanctioned in various government departments in the seven districts of the region under Article 371(J) of the Constitution, of which 79,990 posts were filled, which means that 29,426 posts are vacant. The Cabinet could discuss sanctioning the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kalaburagi, establishment of Skill Centres at Kalaburagi and Koppal districts, and Skill Park in Ballari district. Besides completing the old lift irrigation projects in the region, the Cabinet is expected to give approval for new lift irrigation projects in Koppal and Kalaburagi districts. The Cabinet could also allocate more funds for much-awaited projects, such as Tur Dal Park, Mega Textile Park, Kalyana Patha scheme (construction of 1,000 km roads in rural areas), and land acquisition for the Second Ring Road in Kalaburagi city. Development of Sannati Buddhist site, situated near Kanaganahalli, and ancient Nagavi University; and setting up a tourism circuit covering temples and historical sites, including Kanaganahali, Nagavi, Anjanadri Hills, forts in Kalaburagi, Malkhed and Bidar, and Chandrampalli dam would also be discussed. The Cabinet is likely to approve the establishment of new primary health centres, additional police stations and construction of Mini Vidhana Soudhas in the 18 newly formed taluks in the Kalyana Karnataka region. The first Cabinet meeting in Kalaburagi was held by the then Chief Minister late R. Gundu Rao in 1981. Former Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa held Cabinet meetings in Kalaburagi in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The Jagadish Shettar-led government held one meeting in 2012.

            "content": "Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) withdrew the press release that alleged employees of being influenced by external elements and condemned the unauthorised release of internal communication, according to its statement. \u201cSEBI and its employees have reaffirmed that such issues are strictly internal and will be managed in accordance with the organisation\u2019s high standards of governance and with a time-bound framework\u201d said the markets watchdog said in its September 16 statement. SEBI issued a statement on September 4, clarifying its positions on the employees\u2019 demands in the matter of increased HRA among a list of 16 demands. The statement said that the new demands of the SEBI employees would add another \u20b96 lakhs to their CTC, which already is about \u20b934 lakhs, for grade A officers. Moreover, the officers\u2019 claimed unprofessional work culture to which SEBI said that that such claims were \u201cmisplaced\u201d and that the junior officers had been \u201cbeen receiving messages from external elements outside their group, effectively instigating them to ...go to media, go to the Ministry, go to Board..., perhaps to serve their own purpose\u201d the regulator said in its September 4 press release. Following this, employees of SEBI staged a silent protest for about 90 minutes within the office premises on September 5. Details of the demands and the response of the leadership to the protests is not known. About two weeks after the protest, SEBI chose to withdraw the press release saying that all concerns shall be amicably addressed thorough internal channels.

New Delhi: Bollywood actress Taapsee Pannu has delivered many remarkable and impactful characters to her credit. Her brilliant portrayal of a girl who is a victim of molestation in the film 'Pink' remains one of the most special ones. On the 8th anniversary of Pink, Taapsee acknowledged the current situation of women's safety in the country while revisiting the film's theme. She said, \"8 years back we never knew this small film of ours will find such a big place in the notable films of our country and 8 years after that we can\u2019t believe that we are still amidst the battle and struggle of security of women and their consent. What bitter sweet emotion it is for someone who is proud to be a part of this film.\" Remarkably, at the 64th National Film Awards, Pink won in the category of Best Film on Other Social Issues. In the film, Taapsee played Meenal Arora and received tremendous love for her performance. She played a significant role alongside Amitabh Bachchan and made a lasting impact. Apart from this, Taapsee continued to establish herself as a leading mainstream actress with films like Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba and Khel Khel Mein, both released in August, which became even more special as it is her birthday month. Now, everyone is eagerly looking forward to hearing more about her upcoming projects.",

            "content": "On the 8th anniversary of 'Pink', producer Shoojit Sircar reiterates that the film's true audience is men and boys. New Delhi: As the critically acclaimed film 'Pink' marks its 8th anniversary, it remains a significant cultural touchstone, sparking discussions on gender dynamics and societal norms. Directed by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury and produced by Shoojit Sircar, the film has continued to resonate with audiences and critics alike, thanks to its compelling narrative and powerful performances. Starring Amitabh Bachchan as Deepak Sehgal, a retired lawyer, and Taapsee Pannu as Minal Arora, a young woman embroiled in a legal struggle, 'Pink' offers a nuanced examination of consent and gender equality. Sircar, who served as both the producer and creative director, played a crucial role in shaping the film's impactful message. In a revealing old interview from the film\u2019s release period, Sircar elucidated the true aim of 'Pink'. \u201cPink is not a women\u2019s empowerment film, it is a simple narrative of three women. This film is not for the women, who go through such experiences every single day, it\u2019s for the men and the boys,\u201d Sircar emphasized. His vision was to mirror societal attitudes and challenge the perspectives of those who might not directly confront these issues in their daily lives. The film's ongoing relevance underscores Sircar\u2019s commitment to provoking thought and fostering dialogue through cinema. As he reflects on Pink\u2019s legacy, Sircar remains focused on producing thought-provoking content. His upcoming project, an untitled film featuring Abhishek Bachchan, is slated for a global release on November 15, 2024.",

            "description": "Taliban suspends polio vaccination in Afghanistan, hindering global eradication efforts and risking spread of disease",
            "content": "The Taliban have suspended polio vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan, the U.N. said Monday (September 16, 2024). Afghanistan is one of two countries in which the spread of the potentially fatal, paralysing disease has never been stopped. The other is Pakistan. News of the suspension was relayed to U.N. agencies right before the September immunisation campaign was due to start. No reason was given for the suspension, and no one from the Taliban-controlled government was immediately available for comment. A top official from the World Health Organization said it was aware of discussions to move away from house-to-house vaccinations and instead have immunisations in places like mosques. The WHO has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year, all but two in the south of the country. That\u2019s up from six cases in 2023. \u201cThe Global Polio Eradication Initiative is aware of the recent policy discussions on shifting from house-to-house polio vaccination campaigns to site-to-site vaccination in parts of Afghanistan,\u201d said Dr. Hamid Jafari from the WHO. \u201cPartners are in the process of discussing and understanding the scope and impact of any change in current policy.\u201d Anti-polio campaigns in neighbouring Pakistan are regularly marred by violence. Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilise children. The suspension of the September campaign is a blow for the eradication of polio in Afghanistan. As recently as August, the WHO reported that Afghanistan and Pakistan were continuing to implement an \u201cintensive and synchronised campaign\u201d focusing on improved vaccination coverage in endemic zones and an effective and timely response to detections elsewhere. \u201cDuring a June 2024 nationwide campaign, Afghanistan used a house-to-house vaccination strategy for the first time in five years, a tactic that helped to reach the majority of children targeted,\u201d the WHO said. But southern Kandahar province, the base of Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, used site-to-site or mosque-to-mosque vaccination campaigns, which are less effective than going to people\u2019s homes. Kandahar continues to have a large pool of susceptible children because it is not carrying out house-to-house vaccinations, the WHO said. \u201cThe overall women\u2019s inclusion in vaccination campaigns remains around 20% in Afghanistan, leading to inadequate access to all children in some areas,\u201d it said. \u201cAny setback in Afghanistan poses a risk to the program in Pakistan due to high population movement,\u201d the WHO warned last month. The campaign suspension is the latest obstacle in what has become a problematic global effort to stop polio. The initiative, which costs about $1 billion every year, has missed multiple deadlines to wipe out the disease and technical mistakes in the vaccination strategy set by WHO and partners have been costly. The oral vaccine has also inadvertently seeded outbreaks in dozens of countries across Africa, Asia and the Middle East and now accounts for the majority of polio cases worldwide. This was seen most recently in Gaza, where a baby was partially paralysed by a mutated strain of polio first seen in the oral vaccine, marking the territory\u2019s first case in more than 25 years.

            "description": "The group recently staged I, Josef, Franz Kafka\u2019s most well-known character, in an innovative theatre format.",
            "content": "Sitting in a dark room, a three-dimensional soundscape gets you to enter Josef K\u2019s world. Armed with high-quality wireless headphones, you experience sounds as if they\u2019re all around you \u2014 footsteps from behind, whispers from the side and the bustle of a courtroom. Welcome to I, Josef , a 45-minute deeply immersive and thought-provoking multimedia experience that invites audiences to slip into the shoes of Franz Kafka\u2019s most well-known character, who gets unexpectedly arrested and put on trial for an unspecified crime. This adaptation of Kafka\u2019s Der Prozess ( The Trial ) is re-imagined through a unique first-person perspective that immerses the listener into K\u2019s world through binaural audio. Presented by Kaivalya Plays in collaboration with the Goethe Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan, New Delhi, to celebrate #100YearsKafka, it was staged recently in slots with only 30 audience members in attendance at a time. Relevant script Kaivalya Plays\u2019 general manager Gaurav Singh Nijjer has directed and designed the play| Photo Credit:Courtesy: Kaivalya Plays Despite being written over a century ago, The Trial remains strikingly relevant in today\u2019s world, particularly in India. According to Kaivalya Plays\u2019 general manager Gaurav Singh Nijjer, who directed and designed the play, themes of bureaucratic complexity, the struggle for justice and individual freedom in the face of authority are more pertinent than ever. I, Josef aims to bring these themes to life in a visceral way, encouraging audiences to reflect on their own experiences with societal structures and personal freedoms. \u201cThe narrative of an individual suddenly arrested without explanation and entangled in an opaque, unyielding legal system resonates strongly with contemporary experiences. Moreover, the novel\u2019s exploration of isolation and loneliness speaks to our modern condition, where digital connectivity often paradoxically leads to human disconnection,\u201d elaborated Nijjer. Armed with wireless headphones, you can experience every nuance of the play.| Photo Credit:Courtesy: Kaivalya Plays I, Josef is a natural evolution of Kaivalya Plays\u2019 long-standing interest in audio-based theatrical experiences, including radio play adaptations and immersive audio experiences, such as Lifeline 99 99 . \u201cWe wanted to transform the third-person narrative into a direct, first-person encounter that challenges the audience to experience Josef K\u2019s world from within. Throughout the performance, listeners are challenged to engage with Kafka\u2019s themes on a personal level, feeling Josef\u2019s confusion, despair and search for meaning as if they were their own experiences,\u201d said Kaivalya Plays\u2019 artistic director Varoon P. Anand, who scripted and adapted the play. Sound technique Adapting The Trial for binaural audio was a multi-step process. The team first rewrote the narrative to focus on auditory elements, ensuring that characters identify themselves and that actions are described through recognisable sounds. They then created a 3D soundscape using binaural recording techniques, which captured sound as it would be heard by human ears. \u201cThis allows for a fully immersive audio experience where sounds can be perceived as coming from different directions and distances,\u201d explained Anand. Next, the team carefully selected and rehearsed with actors to find the right voices for each character, recording in both English and German. They procured state-of-the-art wireless headphones and other materials for the installation. Finally, they incorporated subtle projection mapping to enhance the overall immersive experience without detracting from the audio narrative. Kaivalya Plays\u2019 artistic director Varoon P. Anand has scripted and adapted the play| Photo Credit:Courtesy: Kaivalya Plays Last month, Kaivalya Plays staged Martin McDonagh\u2019s The Pillowman in the capital. An edge-of-the-seat dark comedy set in an unnamed totalitarian state, it tells the chilling story of a writer whose macabre tales of child murders blur the line between fiction and reality. The visually stimulating performance, which was performed under license from Concord Theatricals, blended different ideas of storytelling, including projection mapping, live transmissions and audio-video interactions with actors in real-time. From Pillowman by Kaivalya Plays| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Kaivalya Plays plans to continue exploring innovative theatrical formats. Next month, they will present their two-year research on safety in the performing arts and artificial intelligence at the India Foundation for the Arts Research Conference in Bengaluru. In November, they will help a group of young artistes to debut as directors on the Delhi stage with a new self-written production The Golden Commode . They will also stage Mining Hate , an improvised interactive play about the disinformation attacks on Indian journalists that uses AI tools in real time. Further, their new improv team will stage Conspiracy Theory , a long-form improv comedy show about conspiracy theories. Apart from this, they will host workshops by artistes from Australia and Germany this month, bringing more opportunities for Indian artistes to learn from global performers, especially in the area of technology for theatre. \u201cWe envision creating performances that can travel beyond traditional arts spaces, entering classrooms, offices, courtrooms and even the Internet,\u201d concluded Nijjer.

            "content": "KL Rahul\u2019s future with Lucknow Super Giants remains uncertain as rumors suggest a potential return to Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction. KL Rahul\u2019s animated interaction with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owner Sanjeev Goenka during the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season has sparked speculation about the star batter's future with the franchise. Despite Goenka describing Rahul as \"family,\" questions surrounding his retention remain, especially with the highly anticipated mega auction ahead of IPL 2025. Rumors Linking Rahul to Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) I'm happy that KL Rahul knows about the rumours that are going around for him & RCB. Please boss change your IPL team! pic.twitter.com/Os06Uj39gQ Adding to the intrigue, rumors have emerged suggesting that Rahul might part ways with LSG and rejoin his former team, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). Rahul played for RCB for four seasons from 2013 to 2016, and speculation about a possible return intensified after a viral social media clip. In the video, an RCB fan asked Rahul about the rumors of him joining the Bangalore-based team, to which Rahul responded with a cryptic, \"Let's hope so.\" This brief but telling response has fueled further talks of Rahul potentially switching teams, especially as RCB could be on the lookout for a key player in the upcoming auction. Sanjeev Goenka\u2019s Take on KL Rahul Sanjeev Goenka, during the unveiling of Zaheer Khan as LSG\u2019s new team mentor last month, addressed the rumors surrounding Rahul\u2019s future. Speaking to the media, Goenka emphasized his close relationship with the LSG captain: \u201cI've been meeting KL regularly over the last three years. I'm a little surprised this meeting got so much attention. As I've said, we have not taken any call till the retention rules are out.\u201d Goenka reiterated Rahul\u2019s importance to the team, saying, \u201cKL has been an integral and important part of the LSG family since inception. He's played a very important role. He's like family and will always be family.\u201d Retention and Captaincy Decisions Await BCCI Guidelines As the IPL retention rules for the 2025 season have not yet been announced, no formal decisions regarding player retention or leadership have been made. Goenka confirmed this, adding, \"We are waiting for the BCCI to release the retention rules. We have all of September, October, and November to decide that. Let the policies be out. We have not even thought about the team going forward, whether retention will be three, four, five, or six. We have no clue.\" As the 2025 IPL auction draws near, Rahul\u2019s future with LSG remains uncertain. While Goenka\u2019s statements highlight the strong bond between the franchise and its captain, the upcoming auction and retention policies will ultimately decide whether Rahul stays with Lucknow or seeks a fresh start with another team, perhaps even RCB. For now, fans and cricket experts alike eagerly await further announcements, with the mega auction likely to play a pivotal role in determining KL Rahul\u2019s next move in the IPL.",

            "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (September 16, 2024) inaugurated phase II of the Metro rail extension connecting the twin cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. Mr. Modi waved a green flag to start the new route and travelled in the Metro from Sector 1 station of Gandhinagar to GIFT city. Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat and Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel accompanied the Prime Minister on his metro journey, during which he interacted with students and other passengers. As per a government release, part one of phase II spans up to 21 kilometres, covering eight new stations initially, providing efficient transportation services. The project, developed by the Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) in collaboration with the state and Central governments, will expand the metro network, linking key locations between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, such as GNLU, PDEU, Gift City, Raysan, Randesan, Dholakuva, Infocity and Sector-1, it said. The new phase from Motera to Gandhinagar's Sector 1 will connect crucial hubs such as GIFT City, facilitating easy access for professionals, students, and tourists. The total project cost for phase II was \u20b95,384 crore, with funding secured through loans from international agencies like AFD and KfW. The extended route dramatically reduces the travel time between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. For instance, commuters can travel between APMC and GIFT City in under an hour at Rs 35. Ahmedabad city has two metro corridors. With this extension of the Metro from Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar, a major connectivity problem between the twin cities has been resolved.

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari is known for his outspoken attitude. He never holds his horses back when it comes to exposing laxity within the government system. Addressing a gathering on the occasion of 'Engineer's Day' in Pune, Gadkari exposed the prevalent corruption within the bureaucracy while saying that files move faster if there is weight on them. Gadkari was talking about bribes given by people to get files approved. The Union Minister said that the speed of movement of files is directly proportional to the weight (money) on them. Gadkari was talking about issues related to the need for transparency and time-bound decision-making in the government system. Addressing the gathering in which the majority of the government employees were in attendance, Gadkari said that bureaucrats work faster in cases where they get money. \"There are some 'Newton's fathers' in our system and files move faster only if you put more weight on it,\" said Gadkari. | Addressing Engineers Day program organised by Alumni Association of COEP Technological University. https://t.co/G8bh0bfPLM \u2014 Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) September 15, 2024 Using highway projects and road accidents as an example, Gadkari noted that the primary cause of these issues stems from flawed detailed project reports (DPRs), rather than any other factor. Additionally, he pointed out that some bureaucrats require directives for even basic tasks, such as filling potholes on roads. The Union Minister announced that his ministry has planned a 14-lane highway connecting Mumbai and Bengaluru, starting from the Atal Setu Bridge and linking with Pune's ring road. He explained that this will allow travelers from Mumbai to Bengaluru to bypass Pune, helping to reduce traffic in the city. Additionally, the route will provide direct access to Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. \"A tender has already been floated, and we aim to begin construction within the next six months,\" he added.",

            "content": "In a controversial statement, Shiv Sena (Eknath) MLA Sanjay Gaikwad on Monday announced to give Rs 11 lakh to anyone for cutting off Congress leader \u2019s tongue for his remarks on scrapping the reservation system. In his bizarre statement, Gaikwad said, \u201cWhile he was abroad, Rahul Gandhi said that he wants to finish off the reservation system in India. This has exposed the true face of the Congress.\u201d \"During his recent US visit, Rahul Gandhi talked about ending reservations. It shows the mindset that is inherently opposed to reservations. I will reward anyone who cuts off Rahul Gandhi's tongue with Rs 11 lakh,\u201d Gaikwad added. Gaikwad further called Gandhi's statement as treachery. He said, \"Gandhi's comments are the biggest treachery of the people. Communities like Marathas, Dhangars and OBCs are fighting for reservation but before that, Gandhi is talking about ending its benefits.\" Continuing to lash out at Congress, Gaikwad said, \"Rahul Gandhi used to show the Constitution book and spread fake narrative that the BJP would change it. But it is the Congress that plans to take the country back by 400 years.\" Gaikwad's statement has drawn sharp criticism from the opposition. Shiv Sena's allaince partner BJP has also distanced itself from his statement. Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule said he does not support the MLA\u2019s remarks. \"I will not support or endorse Gaikwad's comments. However, we cannot forget that the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had opposed reservations saying it would affect the progress,\" said Bawankule. \u201cRajiv Gandhi had said giving reservations means supporting idiots. Now Rahul Gandhi says he would end reservations,\u201d the BJP leader said. \"We will sensitise the SCs, STs and OBCs and inform them about the comments of Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Even Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange should think about it,\" he said. Lambasting Gaikwad, Atul Londhe, spokesperson of Maharashtra Congress said, \"Sanjay Gaikwad does not deserve to live in society and politics. We want to see whether Maharashtra Home Minister invokes charges of culpable homicide against Gaikwad.\" Aparty from Londhe, Congress MLC Bhai Jagtap also slammed Gaikwad and said, \"I condemn such people and comments. These people have spoiled the politics of the state.\" It is not the first time that Gaikwad has been surrounded by controversy. Last month, a video of a policeman washing his car had gone viral on social media. Gaikwad later explained that the policeman cleaned the vehicle voluntarily after vomiting inside it. In February this year, he gave another controversial remark saying he had hunted a tiger in 1987 and has been wearing its tooth around his neck. Soon after, the state Forest department sent the purported tiger tooth for forensic identification and charged Gaikwad under the Wildlife Protection Act.",

In a recent circular issued, the RB acknowledged that zonal railways have been experiencing difficulties because of vacant posts for gazetted officers and the scheme for re-engagement of retired railway officers of those up to 65 years of age has been cleared. The re-appointments will be valid up to December 31, 2026. Responsibilities of the consultants The proposal is to give such consultants responsibilities like inspections, supervision, drawing, etc., but not an independent charge or appoint as a head of a unit. They would not have any financial powers and are not authorised to issue any kind of safety certificates. Such selected \u2018consultant\u2019 officers would receive a fixed monthly remuneration arrived at by deducting the basic pension from the pay drawn at the time of retirement. There will be no annual increment/percentage increase or Dearness Allowance (DA) during the contract period. While the vacant posts and requirements from among the retired personnel will be put on the official website, the competency of the official to be chosen as consultant will be based on the past performance, medical fitness and evaluation by a three-member panel to be constituted by the GM concerned of the zone, said the directive. Re-engaged consultant will not be retained beyond December 31, 2026 Initially, the period of engagement will be only for one year and can be extended based on the requirement. But, no re-engaged consultant will be retained beyond December 31, 2026. Engagement as consultant also cannot be considered as a \u2018case of re-employment\u2019. The \u2018re-engaged\u2019 officer will not be entitled to house rent allowance and residential accommodation. However, transport allowance for the purpose of commuting between residence and the place of work will be provided as also TA/DA during official tours. The consultants will also have to sign an agreement of confidentiality promising not to divulge any information gathered by him/her during the period of assignment related to the organization to anyone who is not authorized to know/have the same. They are also liable to be \u2018discharged immediately\u2019 on joining of selected candidate(s) from UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) or through departmental selection as per the recommendation of head of the department concerned, reads the official directive issued by the RB to the GMs. Published - September 16, 2024 04:29 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Telangana / indian railways",

            "content": "Batting maestro is set to make his return to Test cricket as he gears up for the upcoming two-match series against Bangladesh. After missing the five-match series against England earlier in the year, Kohli would be hungry to make his mark at home in the series that gets underway from September 19 onwards. It has now become a common practice that whenever Kohli steps out, there are some records on offer. The same goes for the India vs Bangladesh Test series. When the Indian star takes the field, he will have his eyes set on three records. The modern master Kohli is a little away from breaking a massive record of in International cricket. Kohli needs just 58 runs to become the fastest player to hit 27000 runs in International cricket, breaking Tendulkar's record of 27K runs in 623 innings. Kohli has made 26942 runs in 591 innings and has all the time in the world to break this record, while Sachin made 27K runs in 623 innings. Meanwhile, the former Indian skipper is on the cusp of registering another major milestone. Kohli needs just 11 runs to reach 12000 International runs at home. He will become just the fifth player with 12K runs at home in the three formats and the only active player to do so. Sachin Tendulkar (14192), Ricky Ponting (13117), Jacques Kallis (12305) and Kumar Sangakkara (12043) are the only players to have breached the mark so far. The batting icon is closing in on another feat in Test cricket. Kohli has made 8848 runs in Test cricket so far and stands on the cusp of getting to 9000 runs in the format. The 35-year-old needs 152 runs to reach the mark, which will make him the fourth Indian to have hit this many runs in the format. Sachin Tendulkar (15921), Rahul Dravid (13288) and Sunil Gavaskar (10122) are the only others in this list. If Virat gets 152 runs in the opening Test, he will also go past Bradman in a major record list. Kohli is tied with Bradman with 29 Test tons and if he gets one more in the opener or in the second one, he will go past the legendary Australian batter.",

Following a recent Supreme Court judge's observation that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should shed its image as a \"caged parrot,\" Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar highlighted the need for cooperation between key state institutions. Speaking at an event in Mumbai, Dhankhar underscored the importance of the Judiciary, Legislature, and Executive working together to safeguard democratic values and uphold the Constitution. \u201cAll organs of the state \u2013 Judiciary, Legislature, and Executive \u2013 have a single purpose: to ensure the success of the fundamental spirit of the Constitution, to guarantee all rights to the common people, and to help India prosper and flourish,\u201d the Vice President said during the inauguration of the Samvidhan Mandir at Elphinstone Technical High School and Junior College. The Vice President underscored that institutions must be aware of their limitations, both obvious and subtle. He warned that inflammatory political debates or narratives that undermine the institutions of the state could harm their ability to function effectively. ''They need to work in tandem and togetherness to nurture and blossom democratic values and further Constitutional ideals. Let these sacred platforms not trigger points of political inflammatory debate that is detrimental to established institutions that serve the nation well in a challenging and daunting environment. Our institutions perform their duty under tight situations and damaging observations can despirit them. It can set a political debate afloat and trigger a narrative. We have to be extremely conscious about our Institutions. They are robust, they are working independently under the rule of law and there are suitable checks and balances.''

While granting bail to Kejriwal, Justice Bhuyan noted that in a democracy governed by the rule of law, the perception of institutions matters, and the CBI must be seen as independent. Justice Bhuyan cited an earlier instance where the CBI was compared to a \"caged parrot\" by the Supreme Court, calling for the agency to dispel that image. \u201cIt is imperative that CBI dispels the notion of it being a caged parrot. Rather, the perception should be that of an uncaged parrot,\u201d he wrote in his judgment. Political Backlash The \"caged parrot\" comment triggered a political backlash, with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) launching a scathing attack on the central government and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Delhi Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj questioned Shah\u2019s leadership, stating that the Supreme Court's criticism of the CBI raised concerns about the Union Home Ministry's oversight of the agency. \"The Union home minister should resign as this raises questions on him. The Supreme Court called the CBI a caged parrot,\" Bharadwaj stated, adding fuel to the ongoing political debate",

            "description": "The Congress leader said Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have the numbers to place the required Constitutional amendments either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha",
            "content": "Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Monday (September 16, 2024) lashed out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre over the 'one nation, one election' issue , saying it is not possible under the present Constitution and requires at least five Constitutional amendments. Replying to a question on reports that the BJP-led NDA government would implement 'one nation, one election' within its current tenure, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have the numbers to place those constitutional amendments either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. One Nation, One Election: Do States get a say in constitutional amendments? | Explained In his Independence Day address last month, the prime minister made a strong pitch for 'one nation, one election', contending that frequent polls were creating hurdles in the country's progress. Addressing reporters here, Chidambaram said, \"'One nation, one election' is not possible under the present Constitution. It requires at least five constitutional amendments.\" \"Mr Modi does not have the majority to put those constitutional amendments in either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha,\" the former Union minister said. He asserted that there were greater constitutional obstacles to 'one nation, one election'. \"It is not possible. The INDIA bloc is totally opposed to 'One Nation, One Election.\" To a question on PM Modi recently alleging that the Congress wanted to end reservation, Chidambaram rejected the charge. \"Why should we abolish reservation?\" he asked rhetorically. \"We are the ones who are saying that the reservation ceiling of 50 per cent must be removed. We are the ones who are asking for a caste census. We are saying reservation must be according to the population. Do not believe everything the prime minister says,\" he told the reporters. At a rally in Kurukshetra on September 15, Prime Minister Modi had lashed out at the Congress, alleging its \"royal family\" intended to end reservation for Dalits and asserted that as long as he was there, he would not let even a fraction of reservation given by B R Ambedkar be looted or removed. At the media interaction here on Monday Chidambaram was asked if the Congress would announce its chief ministerial face for the October 5 Haryana assembly polls. He said that normally, the Congress does not announce a CM candidate before the polls. \"The practice is that elections take place, MLAs gather and their preferences are asked. Then the high command announces who will be the chief minister. I think the same practice will be followed in Haryana,\" he said. The senior Congress leader hit out at the BJP government in the state over several issues, including unemployment, agriculture and state debt. He appealed to the people to vote for the Congress in the Assembly elections and promised that his party would bring back Haryana's growth rate, give a fillip to development, agriculture, and industry, and tackle issues of unemployment and inflation. \"The BJP boasts of a double-engine government. One engine is without fuel and the other is completely broken down. What is the use of such a double-engine government? The time has come to junk the two engines,\" Chidambaram said.

PM Modi is all set to celebrate his 73rd birthday on Tuesday. BJP leader Purnesh Modi said that several local businesses in his constituency will offer discounts ranging from 10 percent to 100 percent to celebrate Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday. He said that this tradition, where service activities are held, has been observed every year to honour the Prime Minister. Businesses from various sectors, including hotels, restaurants, clinics, vegetable markets, and bakeries, will participate in the initiative. \"In my constituency, every year we do some work in service on PM Modi's birthday... 2,500 businessmen involved in different occupations will provide discounts ranging between 10% to 100%... 110 auto-rickshaws will give 100% discount on that day. We appeal it every year, but we don't force anyone for any kind of offer. They are connected to us and PM Modi with their will... every shop has its own scheme--what to discount, how much discount--it's their decision. It's voluntary; we just connect them with the people,\" Purnesh Modi said. The Auto Union in Surat said it is joining the celebration. Raju Bhandari, the union president, said, \"We will celebrate as seva day (service day), where individual auto drivers are giving [rides for free]. Why not do it as a united move? Hence, we will take passengers for free, and that is on Monday, September 16, a day ahead of Narendra Modi's birthday.\" Shoppers in Surat are also excited about the discounts being offered during the festive season. One shopper said, \"Today, festivals are going on, so we are shopping. I came to know that on September 17, it's PM Modi's birthday, and we are getting good discounts here. So, we bought a few items.\" PM Narendra Modi on his birthday will visit Odisha to initiate the 'Subhadra Yojana.' BJP MP Sambit Patra had earlier said, \"During the election campaign, PM Modi provided a 'Modi Guarantee' in Odisha, promising that if the BJP formed the government, every woman would receive Rs 50,000 over five years. The process begins on September 17, with around 1 crore 30 lakh women set to receive the first installment of Rs 5,000 through the Subhadra Yojana. PM Modi will release this first installment.\"",

            "content": "World Alzheimer\u2019s Day, observed on September 21, aims to raise awareness, support research, and advocate for better care and policies to address the global impact of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. World Alzheimer\u2019s Day, observed annually on September 21, serves as a global platform to raise awareness about Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. This day is dedicated to highlighting the challenges faced by individuals living with dementia, their families, and caregivers while promoting research, education, and support initiatives aimed at combating this debilitating condition. The Importance of World Alzheimer\u2019s Day Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common form of dementia, is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It predominantly affects older adults, though early-onset cases can occur. With millions of people worldwide living with Alzheimer\u2019s or a related dementia, World Alzheimer\u2019s Day plays a crucial role in bringing attention to the impact of these diseases. Raising Awareness The primary goal of World Alzheimer\u2019s Day is to educate the public about Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. By increasing awareness, the day helps to dispel myths and misconceptions, fosters understanding, and encourages compassionate support for those affected. Awareness campaigns often focus on the signs and symptoms of dementia, the importance of early diagnosis, and the need for effective care and support systems. Supporting Research Research into Alzheimer\u2019s disease is vital for understanding its causes, developing effective treatments, and ultimately finding a cure. World Alzheimer\u2019s Day highlights the ongoing research efforts and calls for increased funding and support for scientific studies. Advances in research can lead to better diagnostic tools, innovative therapies, and improved quality of life for individuals living with dementia. Advocating for Policy Change World Alzheimer\u2019s Day also emphasizes the need for policy changes that can enhance the lives of those affected by dementia. This includes advocating for better healthcare services, support for caregivers, and initiatives to make communities more dementia-friendly. Policymakers, healthcare professionals, and organizations use this day to push for changes that address the needs of people with dementia and their families. Supporting Caregivers Caregivers play a crucial role in the lives of individuals with dementia. World Alzheimer\u2019s Day acknowledges their challenges and provides an opportunity to offer support and resources. Caregiving can be physically and emotionally demanding, and providing caregivers with the tools and support they need is essential for maintaining their well-being and the quality of care for those they support. Activities and Observances On World Alzheimer\u2019s Day, various activities take place around the globe, including: - Awareness Campaigns: Events such as seminars, workshops, and public talks are organized to educate people about Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. These events may feature guest speakers, informational booths, and interactive sessions. - Fundraising Events: Many organizations host fundraising events to support Alzheimer\u2019s research and care initiatives. These events can include charity walks, galas, and auctions. - Community Engagement: Communities often engage in activities to make their environments more dementia-friendly. This can include creating awareness programs, offering training for businesses and public services, and fostering social inclusion. - Media Outreach: Media campaigns, including social media posts, articles, and interviews, help spread awareness and engage a broader audience. These campaigns often feature personal stories from individuals and families affected by dementia. World Alzheimer\u2019s Day is more than just a day of recognition; it is a call to action for increased awareness, research, and support for those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. By coming together on this day, individuals, communities, and organizations contribute to the global effort to improve the lives of those living with dementia and work towards a future where the impact of these diseases is significantly reduced.",

            "content": "On the occasion of Hindi Diwas, the governments of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have made an important decision for the upcoming healthcare professionals. After the Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh, both state governments have announced that from the current academic session 2024-25, MBBS will be taught in Hindi within the state. This implementation has been taken in view of the special importance being given by the central government to the Hindi language. The Rajasthan government has decided to introduce the language in phases whereby two medical colleges in the state will adopt the changes from this year's academic session. The names of these colleges are Sampurnanand Medical College of Jodhpur and Medical College of Barmer affiliated under the Marwar Medical University. Chhattisgarh has also announced that the implementation of the new changes will be done from the first year of the 2024-25 session. This decision has been taken to provide benefits to the students who mostly come from Hindi medium schools and face difficulties in medical courses due to the language barrier. 'Studying in Hindi will strengthen their fundamentals, help them to develop a deeper understanding of the subject, and enable them to become better doctors, said Chief Minister Vishnu Dev Sai. The medical aspirants will have a choice to select their preferred language. The introduction of Hindi in medical education was also part of the state's budget. The announcement of MBBS courses in Hindi for Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand was made last year. This came after Union Home Minister Amit Shah unveiled the Hindi MBBS course books in October 2022, which were the first to be published in Hindi. The Bihar government also said in July that Hindi-language Bachelor of Medicine, and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) programmes would be available. On July 2, State Health Minister Mangal Pandey announced that beginning with the next session, students would be able to study MBBS in Hindi.",

            "content": "The withdrawal came days after a protest by a large number of Sebi employees outside the regulator's headquarters on September 5, a day after the press release. They had demanded the withdrawal of the statement and the resignation of Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch. New Delhi: Capital markets regulator Sebi on Monday withdrew its press release issued in September 4, which addressed claims of unprofessional work culture, stating that these concerns are \"misplaced\" and reaffirmed that employee-related issues will be managed internally. The withdrawal came days after a protest by a large number of Sebi employees outside the regulator's headquarters on September 5, a day after the press release. They had demanded the withdrawal of the statement and the resignation of Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch. In a statement on Monday, Sebi acknowledged the critical role its employees have played over the past thirty-six years in shaping the Indian securities market into one of the most dynamic and well-regulated markets globally. Sebi said it addresses employee-related matters through appropriate internal mechanisms. \"Following constructive discussions with representatives of all grades of officers, Sebi and its employees have reaffirmed that such issues are strictly internal and will be managed in accordance with the organization's high standards of governance and within a time-bound framework,\" the regulator said. Accordingly, the press release issued on September 4 has been withdrawn. The decision to retract the press release came after employees strongly condemned the unauthorized dissemination of internal communications. Sebi employees have reiterated their commitment to resolving concerns amicably through established internal channels, ensuring that such matters remain internal and managed within a time-bound framework. \"Employees have strongly condemned the unauthorized release of internal communication and have confirmed that all concerns shall be addressed amicably through established internal channels,\" the statement noted. For Puri, protests and internal issues have come at a time when she is probably facing the most challenging times in her stint. The career banker-turned-regulator is battling speculations on whether a conflict of interest made her go slow on the probe against Adani Group and a raft of other allegations around it. In what is unprecedented for any financial regulator, around 500 employees wrote to the Finance Ministry on August 6, against the top management, for what they called a \"toxic\" work environment, which includes instances of public humiliation and shouting down. After the publishing of a media report about the letter, Sebi responded with a press release, which stated such claims are \"misplaced\", which seemed to have irked the employees. The regulator stated that some \"external elements\" had instigated its employees into believing that they shouldn't be held to high standards of performance and accountability, though, it did not provide specific details.",

            "content": "Bollywood and Tollywood actors Aditi Rao Hydari and Siddharth tied the knot on Monday morning in an intimate wedding in Telangana. The couple opted for a simple South Indian wedding at Sri Ranganayakaswamy temple. The nuptials took place in the presence of their close friends and family. The newlyweds also took to Instagram to share the heartwarming photos from their wedding. Where Aditi chose a Sabyasachi tissue organza lehenga with intricate golden zari embroidery. Siddharth, on the other hand, complemented the bride beautifully with an intricately crafted traditional Veshti bottom and a classic kurta with subtle embroidery. But do you know it was not an easy journey for Sid and Aditi to find their way to each other? Aditi Rao Hydari and Siddharth, both come from a broken marriage experience. Yes! you read that right, the actors were earlier married to other people and had to deal with divorces. The Heeramandi actor was married to actor Satyadeep Mishra, who is now married to fashion designer Masaba Gupta. The couple is now expecting their first child together. According to an earlier interview, Aditi and Satyadeep married in a private ceremony in 2007 when she was only 21 years old. In 2013, she revealed that they had split up, without disclosing the reason behind their divorce. On the other hand, the Rang De Basanti actor previously married Meghna Narayan in November 2003 after falling in love while growing up in the same neighbourhood in New Delhi. Siddharth and his former wife separated in early 2006 and were officially divorced in January 2007. Aditi Rao Hydari and Siddharth met on the set of 'Maha Samudram', a 2021 Telugu film. According to sources, their on-screen chemistry in this action-packed love drama translated into real life, with the two developing a close friendship while filming. They became inseparable over time, frequently seen together on public occasions and referred to one another as 'partners.' Their chemistry was evident, and viewers instantly speculated about the real-life romance happening behind the scenes. Rumours regarding their dating status spread quickly among media outlets. However, Aditi and Siddharth have always kept their relationship private, preferring not to discuss it publically until they exchanged rings in March 2024. Now the couple is officially married and is embarking upon a new journey in their lives.",

Shah, speaking at a public rally in Kishtwar, said the National Conference-Congress alliance will not be able to form the J-K government. \u201cWe will bury terrorism to such a level where it will never come out again.

            "content": "Chidambaram said Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have the numbers to place those constitutional amendments either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. Chandigarh: Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday lashed out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre over the 'one nation, one election' issue, saying it is not possible under the present Constitution and requires at least five constitutional amendments. Replying to a question on reports that the BJP-led NDA government would implement 'one nation, one election' within its current tenure, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have the numbers to place those constitutional amendments either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. In his Independence Day address last month, the prime minister made a strong pitch for 'one nation, one election', contending that frequent polls were creating hurdles in the country's progress. Addressing reporters here, Chidambaram said, \"'One nation, one election' is not possible under the present Constitution. It requires at least five constitutional amendments.\" \"Mr Modi does not have the majority to put those constitutional amendments in either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha,\" the former Union minister said. He asserted that there were greater constitutional obstacles to 'one nation, one election'. \"It is not possible. The INDIA bloc is totally opposed to 'One Nation, One Election.\" To a question on PM Modi recently alleging that the Congress wanted to end reservation, Chidambaram rejected the charge. \"Why should we abolish reservation?\" he asked rhetorically. \"We are the ones who are saying that the reservation ceiling of 50 per cent must be removed. We are the ones who are asking for a caste census. We are saying reservation must be according to the population. Do not believe everything the prime minister says,\" he told the reporters. At a rally in Kurukshetra on September 15, Prime Minister Modi had lashed out at the Congress, alleging its \"royal family\" intended to end reservation for Dalits and asserted that as long as he was there, he would not let even a fraction of reservation given by B R Ambedkar be looted or removed. At the media interaction here on Monday Chidambaram was asked if the Congress would announce its chief ministerial face for the October 5 Haryana assembly polls. He said that normally, the Congress does not announce a CM candidate before the polls. \"The practice is that elections take place, MLAs gather and their preferences are asked. Then the high command announces who will be the chief minister. I think the same practice will be followed in Haryana,\" he said. The senior Congress leader hit out at the BJP government in the state over several issues, including unemployment, agriculture and state debt. He appealed to the people to vote for the Congress in the Assembly elections and promised that his party would bring back Haryana's growth rate, give a fillip to development, agriculture, and industry, and tackle issues of unemployment and inflation. \"The BJP boasts of a double-engine government. One engine is without fuel and the other is completely broken down. What is the use of such a double-engine government? The time has come to junk the two engines,\" Chidambaram said.",

In a scathing speech, Shah said, \u201cThe Congress-National Conference alliance has always nourished terrorism... In the 1990s, when Farooq Abdullah was the Chief Minister after an agreement with Rajeev Gandhi, the Kashmir Valley was soaked in blood due to terrorism. Where were you then? You went to London for a summer vacation.\u201d Targeting the political dynasties of the Congress and NC, Shah alleged that the Nehru, Gandhi, and Abdullah families had perpetuated terrorism and now sought public support once again. \u201cThey boycotted the Kashmiri Pandits, spread terrorism, and delayed reservation. Do you want that NC-Congress alliance again?\u201d Shah questioned the rally attendees.",

            "content": "The Nilgiris forest division has deployed personnel from the forest department to prevent tourists and local residents from disturbing the gregarious flowering of Strobilanthes (Neelakurinji) plants near Udhagamandalam. The blooming of the Strobilanthes species, believed to be Strobilanthes kunthiana has been reported from two parts of the Nilgiris \u2013 near Udhagamandalam and Kotagiri, officials said. As word spreads about the synchronous flowering, many tourists and local residents, hoping to take a picture of the mass flowering have been trying to ascertain the location. Divisional Forest Officer (Nilgiris), S. Gowtham, said that one the sites where the Neelakurinji have bloomed was located within a reserve forest in the Nilgiris forest division. \u201cAs such, people are not permitted to venture into the area, and could face stiff penalties for doing so,\u201d warned Mr. Gowtham. He however added that the other site near Kotagiri was located on the side of a road, and that people, as long as they do not disturb the area, were free to take pictures there. People have also been warned against plucking the flowers. Officials stated that local residents near the site in Ooty, claimed that the last gregarious flowering of the species in the area was in 2012, which could possibly point to the species being Strobilanthes kunthiana . The forest department has not yet collected any specimens from the site, but are considering doing so, as part of their initiative to help propagate the species in their venture to restore native grasslands in the Nilgiris. Local conservationists stated that the forest department should begin making records of the occurrence of Strobilanthes species in the district, so that they can be compared in subsequent years to ascertain whether the species\u2019 ranges were contracting or were remaining stable. \u201cThere have also been instances in the past, where government departments have pushed ahead with infrastructure work within areas where the species were located. These records could help ensure that such loss of habitat to developmental works are prevented,\u201d said the conservationist.

Earlier in the day, he flagged off the 20.8 km long corridor of the Ahmedabad Metro Rail Project Phase II from Sector-1 Station in the state capital. Notably, PM Modi is be on a two-day visit to his home state from September 15 and among several programmes, he inaugurated the Ahmedabad metro extension Phase 2. Part one of Phase 2, the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar metro rail spans up to 21 kilometres, covering a total of eight new metro stations initially and providing seamless and efficient transportation services to both residential and commercial areas. Part two of Phase 1, which is still under construction, will connect Sector 1 in Gandhinagar to Mahatma Mandir, a locality in the state capital which houses a mega convention and exhibition centre. The project, developed by the Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) in collaboration with the state government and the Centre, will further expand the metro network, linking key locations between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar like GNLU (Gujarat National Law University), PDEU (Pandit Deendayal Energy University), Gift City, Raysan, Randesan, Dholakuva, Infocity and Sector-1. This new phase, stretching from Motera to Gandhinagar's Sector-1, will connect crucial hubs such as GIFT City, facilitating easy access for professionals, students, and tourists. The total project cost for Phase 2 metro stands at Rs 5,384 crore with funding secured through loans from international financial institutions like AFD (France) and KfW (Germany). The extended metro route dramatically reduces the travel time between Ahmedabad, Gujarat's commercial hub, and state capital Gandhinagar, located nearly 25km apart. For instance, commuters can now travel between APMC and GIFT City in under an hour, at a cost of around Rs 35.",

            "content": "The Adani Group vehemently rejected fraudulent press releases being circulated related to the conglomerate's presence in Kenya. In a statement released on Monday, the business group claimed that certain \"vested interests with malicious intent\" are circulating multiple fraudulent press releases, including one titled \"Adani Group Denounces Baseless Accusations and Threats\". Notably, the clarification came a week after the workers in Kenya held massive protests against their government's plan to provide airport expansion projects to the Adani group. They alleged the government would lease the airport to Adani Group for 30 years, in exchange for $1.85 billion of investment by Adani into the airport's expansion. However, workers at Kenya's main international airport ended a day-long strike on Wednesday (September 11), after they were assured by the government that a plan to lease the airport to an Indian company would only proceed with the union's approval. This triggered multiple speculative reports published against the business tycoon and his firms. Meanwhile, in a stern statement, the Adani group said it will take legal action against anyone involved in spreading false narratives. \"We categorically state that neither the Adani Group nor any of its companies or subsidiaries have issued any Press Releases related to Kenya,\" the Group spokesperson emphasised. \"We strongly condemn this deceitful act and urge everyone to disregard these fake fraudulent releases completely. We will take legal action against anyone involved in spreading false narratives,\" said the Group. The spokesperson encouraged the \"media and influencers to verify facts and sources before publishing or broadcasting any articles or news on the Adani Group\". Last week, the Adani Group unequivocally rejected and denied baseless allegations regarding claims by US short-seller Hindenburg Research that Swiss authorities have frozen its funds. Dismissing the allegations, an Adani Group spokesperson denied the baseless claims. \"We unequivocally reject and deny the baseless allegations presented. The Adani Group has no involvement in any Swiss court proceedings, nor have any of our company accounts been subject to sequestration by any authority,\u201d the company spokesperson had said. The Adani Group remains \"steadfastly committed to transparency and compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements,\" the spokesperson noted. (With inputs from agency)",

On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival (17 September), the festive experience will be further elevated by the debut of the Hong Kong Tourism Board's (HKTB) first Mid-Autumn Festival-themed drone show, featuring thousands of drones weaving together several stunning scenes to convey festive blessings.",

            "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that he does not come under pressure in any circumstances. His remarks came while talking about big targets set by different countries around the world. \"A journalist asked me about the various big targets set by different countries around the world and whether I felt any pressure from these targets. I responded to the media by saying, 'Yeh Modi hai, yaha kisi ka dabaav nahi chalta hai',\" PM Modi said while addressing the fourth Global Renewable Energy Investor's Meet in Gujarat's Gandhinagar. Notably, the Opposition has time and again alleged that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government led by PM Narendra Modi in its third term has become \"weak\" as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 on its own. The Opposition has been alleging that the BJP 3.0 is running on \"crutches\" of the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal United (JDU) and the Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) who have played the role of kingmakers in the NDA government after the BJP fell short of the majority mark on June 4. The Opposition's claims come as the Centre sent the Waqf Board Bill in the Parliament to the Joint Parliamentary Committee for wider discussion and consideration. Since June 9, when Prime Minister Modi was sworn in for the post for the third consecutive term, the government also rolled back the lateral entry scheme of the UPSC. Prime Minister Modi said green future and net zero are India's commitments and the country is \"worried about the future of humanity\". \"When the issue of climate change did not even emerge in the world, Mahatma Gandhi alerted the world... His life was of minimum carbon footprint... He had said that the earth has enough resources to fulfil our needs but not our greed... For us, green future and net zero are not just some fancy words but they are India's commitment... As a developing economy, we had a valid excuse to discard these commitments. We could have said that we cannot play a role in this sector. But we did not do that. We were the people who worried about the future of humanity... Today's India is creating a base for the next 1000 years,\" he said. \"Our goal is not just to reach the top but also to sustain at the top. India knows its energy needs and requirements to become a developed nation by 2047. We also know that we do not have our own oil and gas reserves... So we decided to build our future on solar, wind, nuclear and hydro powers...,\" PM Modi added.",

Their information has been gathered, and those who had direct contact have been placed in isolation. The death of a 24-year-old student in Malappuram, Kerala, has raised alarm over the deadly Nipah virus. Kerala Health Minister Veena George announced on Sunday that tests conducted at the National Institute of Virology in Pune confirmed the presence of the Nipah virus in the deceased. The health minister informed the media that a total of 151 people are currently on the primary contact list. Their information has been gathered, and those who had direct contact have been placed in isolation. Five individuals in isolation exhibited mild symptoms, and their samples have been sent for testing. Nipah was first detected in Malaysia in 1999, though no further outbreaks have been reported there since. Two years later, the virus was identified in Bangladesh and India. India's first case of Nipah virus occurred in Siliguri, West Bengal, in 2001. In Kerala, where two cases have been reported this year, previous outbreaks occurred in Kozhikode district in 2018, 2021, and 2023, and in Ernakulam district in 2019. How does it spread? The Nipah outbreak in Kerala is cause for significant concern due to the severity of the disease, which has a fatality rate of up to 75%. Fruit bats are the natural carriers of the virus, and it can be transmitted to humans through contamination from animals like pigs and bats. Additionally, the virus can spread from human to human. Nipah virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, such as bats or pigs, or their body fluids (like blood, urine, or saliva). It can also spread by consuming food products contaminated by body fluids from infected animals, such as palm sap or fruit tainted by an infected bat. Additionally, close contact with an infected person or their bodily fluids, including nasal or respiratory droplets, urine, or blood, can lead to transmission. Symptoms and complications associated with Nipah virus infection Nipah infection presents with common symptoms such as headache, fever, vomiting, sore throat, dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and acute encephalitis. Symptoms typically appear 4 to 14 days after exposure. The virus has a significant impact on neurological health, with approximately 20% of infected individuals experiencing lasting neurological effects, including seizure disorders and personality changes. According to information from the Kerala health department, Nipah virus infection symptoms can vary from mild to severe, with a fatality rate of 40% to 70% in documented outbreaks between 1998 and 2018. Nipah virus infection is diagnosed in its early stages using RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) and later in the infection through ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Early diagnosis can be difficult as the initial signs and symptoms are often non-specific. To prevent the spread of Nipah virus, several precautionary steps must be taken. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises avoiding close, unprotected physical contact with individuals infected by the virus. It also recommends frequent handwashing, especially after caring for or visiting sick people.",

            "content": "Donald Trump blasted Taylor Swift on social media for endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, declaring his hatred for the pop star. Washington: Former US President Donald Trump slammed singer Taylor Swift, days after she endorsed his presidential rival and Vice President, Kamala Harris. In a strongly worded post, Trump said he \"hates\" the pop star. \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" he said on Truth Social on Sunday. Last week, Taylor Swift came in support of Vice President Kamala Harris, the day she sparred off Trump in a presidential debate organised by ABC News. \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" Swift said. On Wednesday, she took to Instagram and penned a lengthy note. The note stated, \"Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven't already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.\" Harris was nominated as the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden quit the presidential race amid mounting concerns over his age, particularly after his poor show in the debate with Donald Trump in June. She is the first female, first Black, and first Asian American vice president. If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president. The vice president is only the second woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party. Heaping praises on Harris, Swift called her a \"warrior\" and a \"steady-handed, gifted leader\". She also said the country can accomplish much more if led by 'calm' than being led by \"chaos,\" in a veiled reference to former President Trump. \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades,\" the singer added. A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) She concluded her post by calling herself a \"childless cat lady,\" alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen JD Vance, Trump's running mate, to criticize Democrats. Kamala Harris is of Indian origin. Her mother was Indian and her father is Jamaican; both immigrated to the United States. She was born in Oakland, California, and attended a historically black university, Howard University, in Washington.",

Mumbai: Masaba Gupta recently made her appearance on Fate D'Souza's podcast where she spoke about the cruelty she has faced due to several things. Recalling how she was trolled massively for starting her makeup brand Love Child. Masaba reveals her skin was compared to late veteran actor Om Puri and more. She even recalled how she was teased by boys when she was a professional tennis player,\u201d There was a lot of catcalling from the boys about my body. I was a professional tennis player, so I had these broad shoulders and ripped arms and legs. I also developed very early, so I was not dainty, or feminine, so it was like where is this thing from? I was very happy in my own bubble in school, I did my own thing. I didn\u2019t make great friends in school which I regret apart 2-3 of them.\u201d Watch the video of Masaba Gupta talking about the trolling she faced for being born out of wedlock and more. A post shared by Faye D\u2019Souza (@fayedsouza) Masaba even revealed she was called a bastard child, as her mother Neena Gupta had her before marriage, \u201cIt was used against me 100 percent, it was public and it was very interesting because the kids would speak about it like adults. I could hear them repeating something they heard in their house. One kid went on to say, \u2018Hey bast**d, I believe you are a bast**d child\u2019. This was when I was in the 7th grade. A lot of people also didn\u2019t understand how I looked physically or why I looked like that\u201d. Masaba is a successful entrepreneur and fashion designer today and she is all set to embrace motherhood.",

About a quarter of Mardis' business comes from real estate agents who are prepping homes for sale or from new home buyers. Customer queries, he recalls, quickly dropped almost as soon as the Fed started jacking up interest rates in March 2022 and then kept raising rates through July 2023.As the housing market contracted, Mardis had to lay off about half his staff of 30. It was the worst dry spell he had experienced in 14 years.After the Fed begins cutting rates on Wednesday, Mardis envisions brighter times ahead. Typically,",

Through this film, will once again be seen entertaining the audience as Vicky. In the earlier film Stree 2, his character's name was also Vicky. For the first time, Rajkummar and Triptii Dimri's pair will be seen in the upcoming film 'Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video'. Although this comedy film is being liked a lot through its trailer, after watching many of its scenes, you will remember the Hollywood film Sex Tape. It was being said that this film has been copied from Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel starrer Sex Tape. Now director Raj Shandilya has given his clarification on this. He said that he had not even seen the Hollywood film. In an interview with PTI, Raj said, 'My film is completely different from the Hollywood film Sex Tape. Their characters are also not the same. Someone asked me on Twitter if this film is like 'Sex Tape'. I said that there is no sex in our film. One of our writers told me that their video in that film has gone viral on the internet. The video of our film is made by the couple and they lose the CD due to their negligence.' The director further said, 'I am not inspired by that film, rather in these matters I get inspired by the people and environment around me. At the same time, the sequel of this film is also going to come soon. This film was written in the era when the Internet had just come to India. The story of Part 2 will be about 10 to 15 years later.' Vicky Vidya's Woh Wala video is produced by Bhushan Kumar's T-Series. Apart from Rajkummar and , Vijay Raaz, Mallika Sherawat, Tiku Talsani and Archana Puran Singh will be seen among others. This film will be released in theatres on October 11.",

The toss was also not possible as the sub-standard facilities at the venue came under the scanner. New Zealand's plan to get acclimatised to the Asian conditions with this Test match failed and without any match practice and warm-up game, they will take the field in Galle on Wednesday (September 18). Sri Lanka, on the other hand, are high on confidence after their win over England in the third Test match at the Oval. Even though they lost the three-match series, a win away from home, especially in England, is always special and Dhanajaya de Silva will be hoping that his team continues to perform well in favourable conditions. The first Test will be special as it will go on for six days with the rest day allocated on September 21. There is the presidential election in Sri Lanka on that day and no play will be possible. 1st Test - September 18 - September 23 at 10 AM IST 2nd Test - September 26 - September 30 at 10 AM IST Both matches will be played at Galle International Stadium in Galle.

            "content": "In the vast landscape of travel accommodations, a quiet revolution is underway\u2014a subtle shift that is profoundly altering the way we experience the world. While hotels and resorts have long reigned as the quintessential choices for travelers, a rising star has emerged in the realm of hospitality\u2014the homestay. Homestays are steadily gaining popularity, and their ascent is not by chance. They offer travelers something that traditional accommodations often struggle to provide\u2014an intimate, cozy, and immersive experience that transcends the standard tourist encounter. This shift toward homestays is driven by the desire for a more personal and authentic connection to the places we visit, and it's transforming the way we perceive and enjoy travel. So, what exactly fuels the appeal of homestays, and what sets them apart in today's crowded travel landscape? Let's see what Zishan Khan, Chief Acquisition Officer & Co-Founder, Ekostay has to say on this: Authenticity: In an era where authenticity is a revered currency in travel, homestays stand as a paragon of genuine experiences. Modern travelers seek more than just a superficial encounter with a destination; they yearn to delve deep into its heart. Homestays, unlike standard hotel rooms, serve as a portal to this world of authenticity. By situating guests within local communities, they facilitate a seamless transition from tourist to temporary local. Travelers get to engage with the culture, traditions, and rhythms of everyday life in an authentic and meaningful way. Personal Touch: Homestays offer a level of personalization that is unparalleled. Hosts often go above and beyond to ensure guests feel not just accommodated but genuinely welcomed. It's not uncommon to find freshly baked goods awaiting you, a handwritten note from your host expressing their excitement for your visit, or a curated guide to hidden gems and dining spots in the area. This personal touch creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, leaving an indelible impression that lasts well beyond the stay. Privacy and Space: Unlike the often bustling and impersonal atmosphere of hotels, homestays provide a haven of privacy and space. Whether you're seeking a romantic escape or a family retreat, these accommodations offer the ideal setting. Enjoy leisurely mornings in your own space, whip up a culinary masterpiece in a well-equipped kitchen, or simply unwind in a cozy living room. Homestays are versatile and cater to a wide range of travelers and their diverse needs. Value for Money: In addition to the advantages of an authentic experience and personalization, homestays often deliver exceptional value for money. Guests receive more space, privacy, and amenities compared to what traditional accommodations offer at a similar price point. This cost-effective equation benefits both hosts and guests, making homestays a smart and rewarding choice. The allure of homestays resides in their unique ability to offer cozy getaways. They transport travelers from the standard hotel experience to a realm of warmth, personal connections, and authentic encounters. When you opt for a homestay, you're not merely selecting a place to stay; you're choosing a more intimate and personal way to travel. Homestays are no longer an emerging trend; they are a burgeoning phenomenon in the travel industry, and their popularity shows no sign of waning. With their capacity to seamlessly blend the comforts of home with the richness of local culture, they are setting a new standard for travel accommodations. The future of travel is undeniably undergoing a transformation, and homestays are at the forefront of this paradigm shift. They are redefining the travel experience, turning it into a journey of warmth, authenticity, and personal connections. Travelers are no longer content with being mere observers; they want to be participants, and homestays are the conduit for this transformation. As we continue to seek meaningful and memorable travel experiences, the appeal of homestays is poised to grow, making them a compelling choice for travelers in search of a deeper, cozier, and more authentic way to explore the world.",

            "content": "As \u2018Pink\u2019 marks its 8th anniversary, it continues to resonate deeply with audiences and critics alike. The film, which won the National Award for its poignant portrayal of gender issues and sexual harassment, remains a significant milestone in Indian cinema. Shoojit Sircar, who produced the film under the banner of Rising Sun Films and was also the creative director of the film, his vision was instrumental in shaping the film, particularly the climax, which heightened its emotional and social impact. Known for his thoughtful approach to filmmaking, Sircar has always emphasized the deeper purpose behind \u2018Pink\u2019. In a throwback to when \u2018Pink\u2019 received its National Award, Sircar shared his perspective on the film's purpose and reception. He reflected on the significance of the film in a way that reveals his deeper intentions, stating, in an old interview, Shoojit stated, \"I am delighted that the people and the jury have enjoyed it; I am proud and honoured, but this film is to reflect, not to celebrate. If you see this film and come out, it will leave you with a strong impression. It still bothers me to watch my own film, so no celebrations. We wish to reflect. And we are going to carry this notion forward. We will take Pink wherever feasible so that it can reach the widest audience.\" This quote, emphasises Sircar's intention for the film to be a catalyst for reflection rather than celebration. The film's themes of introspection and societal issues have only grown more relevant as conversations around such topics continue to evolve and gain prominence. Looking ahead, Shoojit Sircar and Rising Sun Films are set to continue their tradition of thought-provoking cinema. Their next untitled project, featuring , is scheduled for a worldwide release on November 15th, 2024. As Sircar remains dedicated to creating impactful stories, \u2018Pink\u2019 stands as a powerful example of his commitment to meaningful and socially conscious filmmaking.",

            "content": "Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar expressed confidence that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will emerge victorious in the upcoming Haryana assembly elections and form the government in Haryana under the leadership of Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini. Speaking to the media, Khattar emphasised that the BJP is on track to form the government again, citing the lack of any strong opposition or coalition efforts by the Congress. Khattar took a sharp dig at the Congress party, predicting their defeat, and highlighted its isolation in the political landscape. \"No party has extended their hand for an alliance with Congress, which shows their weakening position,\" Khattar remarked. He also criticised Congress leaders for making \"absurd\" and \"irresponsible\" statements on sensitive issues such as reservation and the Sikh community. Khattar's statements come as the BJP ramps up its campaign efforts ahead of the state elections, with Saini emerging as the key face of the party's leadership in Haryana. Earlier on Sunday, Union Minister also asserted that Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini is the BJP's CM face and the party will score a hattrick of wins in the state under his leadership. Pradhan and Khattar's statements came after BJP's senior leader Anil Vij said he will stake claim for the CM's post if the party returns to power after the October 5 assembly polls in Haryana. The Election Commission of India (ECI) today (August 31) revised the polling day for Haryana Assembly Elections from October 1 to October 5, this year as well as moved the counting of votes for both Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana Assemblies from October 4 to October 8. The decision has been taken to honour both the voting rights and the traditions of the Bishnoi community, which has upheld a centuries-old practice of participating in the Asoj Amavasya festival celebration in remembrance of their Guru Jambheshwar as per the ECI.",

            "content": "BJP's Sirsa candidate Rohtash Jangra on Monday (September 16) said he has withdrawn nomination for the seat, indicating that the party is likely to extend support to Haryana Lokhit Party chief Gopal Kanda. Kanda is a sitting MLA from Sirsa. He had earlier extended his support to the BJP government. \"I have withdrawn my nomination. The decision has been taken in the interest of the state and the country...we have to ensure a 'Congress Mukt Haryana',\" Jangra told PTI over the phone. Asked if he has withdrawn in Kanda's favour, Jangra said, \"Gopal Kanda has supported us (BJP) for five years. We have taken this decision for Sirsa's development.\" The BJP, like the Congress, will now be contesting 89 of the 90 Assembly seats in the state. The Congress has left the Bhiwani seat for CPI(M). Last week, the BJP released its third and final list of candidates for the Haryana polls, in which the party fielded Jangra from Sirsa. The Indian National Lok Dal said on Thursday that it was extending support to Kanda in Sirsa. The INLD is contesting the assembly polls in alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Gopal Kanda, the leader of the Haryana Lokhit Party, is a 57-year-old MLA from Sirsa. He founded this party himself. Kanda has previously served as the state's Home, Industries, and Urban Local Bodies Minister. He recently gained attention when a Delhi court acquitted him in a high-profile case where he was accused of abetting the suicide of an air hostess. In the last election, Gopal Kanda won the Sirsa Assembly seat by a narrow margin, defeating his closest rival, independent candidate Gokul Setia, by just 602 votes. Polling for the 90 Assembly seats in Haryana will be held on October 5 and votes will be counted on October 8. The ruling BJP is eyeing a hat-trick of wins but faces a stiff challenge from a resurgent Congress, which is looking to cash in on the anti-incumbency factor.",

            "content": "Mamata Banerjee has made a final attempt to negotiate with agitating doctors at RG Kar Hospital, inviting them to a crucial meeting in hopes of resolving the ongoing strike. Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government on Monday invited the agitating doctors for the \u2018fifth and the final time\u2019 to hold talks to put an end to the RG Kar impasse. This move comes two days after the state chief minister faced a deadlock on live streaming of the meeting. In an email, Chief secretary Manoj Pant has asked the protesters to meet Mamata Banerjee at her residence in Kalighat at 5 pm today. \"This is the fifth and the final time we are reaching out to you for a meeting between the honourable CM and the delegates. In line with our discussion the day before (Saturday), we are once again inviting you for the meeting with the CM at her Kalighat residence for discussions with an open mind,\" he wrote, reported PTI. Pant expressed optimism that \"good sense will prevail\" following an agreement on Saturday to prohibit live-streaming or videography of the meeting, as the issue remains sub-judice before the Supreme Court. \"Instead, the minutes of the meeting will be recorded and signed by both the parties,\" he said. In response to the email, the protesting doctors stated they would deliberate among themselves before deciding whether to attend the meeting. Junior doctors at the state-run hospital have been on strike since August 9, protesting the rape and murder of a colleague at the facility.",

Aside from sounding off on social media, golf was on the agenda.Then the Secret Service spotted the muzzle of a rifle sticking out of a fence in bushes at Trump's West Palm Beach golf club, and everything changed.For the second time in just over two months, someone apparently tried to shoot Trump and came dangerously close to the former president in that effort within 500 yards Sunday, law enforcement officials said. This time, the gunfire came from the Secret Service, before the suspect could get any shots off at his target.The episode raised sharp questions about how to keep the former president safe -- not only while he is campaigning across the country, but while he spends time at his own clubs and properties.Trump has had stepped-up security since the assassination attempt on him in July, when he was wounded in the ear during an attack that laid bare a series",

            "description": "The COP29 summit will be the most watched as it is expected to land a new agreement on climate finance",
            "content": "Global warming. Disappearing plant and animal species. Fertile land turning to desert. Plastic in the oceans, on land, and the air we breathe. These urgent environmental challenges will be in the spotlight over the next few months as the United Nations hosts four major sessions to address key threats to the planet. Biodiversity First up is a Conference of the Parties (COP) dedicated to biodiversity being held in Cali, Colombia, from October 21 to November 1. These are called every two years to debate how the world can cooperate to better protect the rich variety of plant and animal life in the natural world. The COP16 isn\u2019t expected to break new ground but is more a stocktake of progress since the last summit secured historic assurances for biodiversity. In 2022 in Montreal, nations agreed to place 30 percent of the planet under environmental protection by 2030 in a landmark pact aimed at arresting biodiversity loss and restoring ecosystems to health. In Cali, countries will put forward national strategies to meet this global objective, and observers hope Colombia as host will provide a model for others to follow. WWF has commended the leadership shown so far by Colombia, which hosts close to 10 percent of Earth\u2019s biodiversity, including countless bird, butterfly, and orchid species. Climate The world\u2019s most important conference on climate change is this year being hosted by Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic heavily dependent on oil and gas exports, from November 11 to 22. While the last summit in Dubai in 2023 delivered a historic commitment to transition the world away from fossil fuels, supporting poorer countries with climate change will top this year\u2019s agenda. The summit, known as COP29, is expected to land a new agreement on climate finance: money from rich nations most responsible for global warming to developing countries vulnerable to climate change. There isn\u2019t an agreed figure yet, or even consensus on where the money should come from, who should receive it, and what form it could take. But developing countries are pushing for much more than the $100 billion pledged in 2009. This was only reached for the first time in full in 2022. \u201cCOP29 offers an opportunity to unlock more climate investments from a wider range of public and private sources and to improve the quality of this finance,\u201d said the World Resources Institute, a US think tank. The result of the US election, just six days before COP29 begins, could throw a last-minute curveball into the final negotiations, which have proved divisive so far. It also remains to be seen how many world leaders travel to Baku, the capital on the Caspian Sea, with some expected to focus their energy on COP30 in Brazil next year. Desertification The least high profile of the three COPs, this session in Saudi Arabia addressing the loss of fertile land to desert is nonetheless critical. Climate variation like droughts and human activities like overgrazing can result in desertification, a process mainly in dry areas where land degrades and becomes unproductive. Experts hope the COP16 on desertification, scheduled to take place in Riyadh from December 2 to 13, can act as a turning point in addressing this problem. \u201cDiscussions will focus on ways to restore 1.5 billion hectares of land by 2030, as well as putting in place agreements to manage the droughts that are already affecting many regions of the globe,\u201d said Arona Diedhiou from the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development. Plastic In 2022, some 175 nations agreed to fast-track negotiations toward a world-first treaty on plastic pollution, and the final session gets underway on November 25 in South Korea. The treaty aims to marshal an international response to the plastic trash choking the environment, from oceans and rivers to mountains and sea ice. Some nations want the treaty to restrict how much plastic can be made while others -- particularly oil and gas producing countries that provide the raw materials to make plastic -- want a focus on recycling. Hellen Kahaso Dena, head of Greenpeace\u2019s Pan-African Plastics Project, hopes that countries \u201cwill agree on a treaty that prioritises reducing plastic production\u201d. \u201cThere is no time to waste with approaches that will not solve the problem,\u201d the activist said.

            "content": "The re-release of 'Tumbbad' has quickly matched its original week-long earnings of \u20b97.34 crore in just three days. New Delhi: The re-release of the critically acclaimed film 'Tumbbad' has achieved a significant box office milestone, mirroring its original week-long earnings in just three days. Originally launched in 2018, 'Tumbbad' earned \u20b97.34 crore over its first week. During its recent re-release, the film has matched this impressive figure in a mere three days, underscoring its continued resonance with audiences. The film\u2019s re-release has witnessed a remarkable box office performance, beginning with \u20b91.65 crore on its first day, followed by an impressive \u20b92.65 crore on the second day. By the end of Day 3, Tumbbad\u2019s cumulative earnings have reached \u20b97.34 crore, effectively replicating its initial week\u2019s revenue within a fraction of the time. This rapid success highlights the film's sustained allure and the growing enthusiasm among viewers for its unique cinematic experience. A post shared by Sohum Shah Films (@sohumshahfilms) Directed by Rahi Anil Barve and guided by Anand Gandhi, 'Tumbbad' has long been celebrated for its distinctive horror-fantasy narrative and breathtaking visual storytelling. The film's immersive atmosphere and innovative approach have garnered critical acclaim and a devoted fan base. Its re-release, brought to the big screen by Eros International and Aanand L Rai, has rekindled interest and excitement, reaffirming the film's status as a modern classic. The strategic decision to limit the film's availability to theatrical screenings, with no presence on OTT platforms, has fueled the buzz and generated significant audience engagement. This approach has proved successful, as evidenced by the film\u2019s robust box office performance over the weekend, particularly on Day 3. The resurgence of 'Tumbbad' in theaters has set new benchmarks for re-releases in the Indian film industry. The film\u2019s remarkable performance demonstrates the enduring power of experiencing cinematic masterpieces on the big screen, where their full artistic and emotional impact can be fully appreciated. This renewed success highlights the value of classic films and their ability to captivate audiences across time.",

The AAP has scheduled a series of meetings, including that of its political affairs committee, to decide on a new chief minister for Delhi, a day after Arvind Kejriwal's surprise announcement of quitting the post. Senior AAP leader and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia reached Kejriwal's official residence to discuss with him the names of probables for the chief minister's post, AAP leaders said. The AAP's Political Affairs Committee meeting is scheduled to be held at the Delhi chief minister's residence later in the evening. Delhi ministers Atishi, Gopal Rai, Saurabh Bharadwaj, Kailash Gahlot, some MLAs from the reserved category, including Deputy Speaker of Delhi Assembly Rakhi Birla, as well as the AAP supremo's wife Sunita Kejriwal, were making the rounds as probables for the post. Addressing AAP workers at party headquarters on Sunday, Kejriwal announced to step down as chief minister amid corruption allegations against him and vowed not to return to the post till he got a \"certificate of honesty\" from the people. The AAP national convener said that he would become chief minister and Manish Sisodia his deputy \"only when people say we are honest\". A party functionary on Monday said, \"Kejriwal and Sisodia will be meeting today. This will be the first meeting after the decision by them.The meeting is also likely to see a discussion over the next chief minister.\" Kejriwal, who was released on bail from the Tihar Jail in the excise policy graft case on Friday, has said that he would hold a meeting of the AAP MLAs in a couple of days and one of his party colleagues would take over as the chief minister.",

Oshada Fernando has returned to the Test side for the first time since March 2023, having played against the same opposition, New Zealand, 18 months ago. Fernando has replaced Nishan Madushka in the 16-man squad for the Test series in Galle. Fernando returned with scores of 122 and 80 for Sri Lanka A against South Africa A and hence has been recalled to the side. Kasun Rajitha and Nisala Tharaka have been axed from the squad that played the England series while 13 players have been retained. Sri Lanka have added a couple of more spinners for the assignment, understandably, given the change in the conditions from the UK and since they are coming off winning at the Oval and avoiding a sweep, the islanders will be slightly confident of a better show in familiar conditions against a side, which hasn't travelled well. New Zealand are on a long tour of Asia having been to India for the one-off Test against Afghanistan. The Kiwis will be playing a couple of Tests against Sri Lanka and then will return to India for a three-match series in October-November. Sri Lanka are in fifth position on the World Test Championship (WTC) points table with a PCT of 42.86 while New Zealand are in third with a 50.00 PCT. New Zealand have a long Test season ahead as they play Sri Lanka and India away, followed by England at home. These five Tests will all but decide their fate in the ongoing WTC cycle. (captain), Dimuth Karunaratne, Pathum Nissanka, , , , Kamindu Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Oshada Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Prabath Jayasuriya, Ramesh Mendis, Jeffrey Vandersay, Milan Rathnayake",

            "content": "In a significant development into the rape and murder case of a trainee doctor in Kolkata, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has raised serious concerns about the role of RG Kar Hospital's former principal Sandip Ghosh in an ongoing investigation, suspecting that he tried to deceive the polygraph test. According to the CBI\u2019s remand note, there were several key questions in the case where Ghosh\u2019s responses were found to be \"deceptive\" based on the polygraph results prepared by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL). Taking this into consideration, the investigative agency now intends to conduct a narco test on Ghosh to gather more truthful information. Sandeep Ghosh, the former Principal of RG Kar Medical College, is under scrutiny in a case involving the suspicious death of a second-year female Postgraduate trainee doctor. The CBI has already conducted polygraph tests on ten individuals, including Ghosh, but inconsistencies in Ghosh's responses have made the agency suspicious of his role in the case. The remand note claimed that Ghosh, despite receiving information about the incident, did not immediately rush to the hospital or take formal action. Instead, an ambiguous complaint was later lodged through the Vice Principal (Medical Superintendent), Dr Sumit Roy Tapadar. The complaint, submitted to the Officer-in-Charge of Tala Police Station, Abhijit Mondal, vaguely mentioned that the body of the female student was found in the Chest Seminar Room at 9:45 a.m (August 10) but it made no reference to the possibility of murder or sexual assault, even though external injuries on the body indicated foul play, as per the remand note. The CBI has pointed out that Ghosh\u2019s delayed and unclear actions have further complicated the investigation. It also noted that instead of filing a First Information Report (FIR) promptly, Ghosh and the hospital authorities allegedly promoted a suicide theory, despite clear evidence to the contrary. The victim\u2019s body bore visible external injuries, which indicated that it was not a case of suicide, yet the hospital\u2019s complaint failed to mention the possibility of homicide or rape. It is pertinent here that a postgraduate trainee doctor was allegedly raped and murdered while on duty at the hospital on August 9. Later, the semi-naked body of the 32-year-old woman was found in the seminar hall of the government-run hospital in Kolkata. A civic volunteer was arrested in connection with the crime the next day. Following this, the Calcutta High Court ordered the transfer of the probe into the case from the Kolkata Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation.",

Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule said he does not support the MLA\u2019s remarks. BJP is a constituent of the Shiv Sena-led government in the State. \u201cWhile he was abroad, Rahul Gandhi said that he wants to finish off the reservation system in India. This has exposed the true face of the Congress,\u201d Mr. Gaikwad told reporters, before announcing the bizarre reward. Mr. Gaikwad, an MLA from Buldhana Assembly seat in Vidarbha region, is no stranger to controversies. Last month, a video of a policeman washing the Shiv Sena MLA\u2019s car had gone viral on social media. Mr. Gaikwad had later explained that the policeman cleaned the vehicle voluntarily after vomiting inside it. In February, Mr. Gaikwad had claimed that he had hunted a tiger in 1987 and has been wearing its tooth around his neck. Soon after, the State Forest Department sent the purported tiger tooth for forensic identification and charged Mr. Gaikwad under the Wildlife Protection Act.

Wearing masks has been made compulsory while going out in the district. Students and teachers across the district have been asked to wear masks while in school. Wards 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Thiruvali grama panchayat and ward 7 of Mampad grama panchayat have been declared containment zones. People in those wards have been advised not to gather and to avoid all social functions. Shops and business establishments will be allowed to work from 10 am to 7 pm in these zones. Schools, colleges, madrassas, anganwadis and cinema halls will remain closed until further orders in these zones. Fifteen persons who took part in the funeral of the 24-year-old Nipah victim have been placed under observation. As many as 151 people who came in direct contact with the victim, who was a student in Bengaluru, have been quarantined. The deceased youth had earlier reportedly sought treatment at four private hospitals, and had travelled to different places along with his friends. Serum samples of five persons who developed symptoms were sent for testing. The results are awaited by Monday evening, said the officials. Nipah death in July On July 21, 2024, a 14-year-old schoolboy from Pandikkad, about 10 km away from Wandoor, Malappuram, had succumbed to Nipah virus at Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. The boy\u2019s death had triggered an alarm across Malappuram district, and the district authorities had imposed restrictions in two panchayats then. A previous Nipah outbreak in Malappuram and Kozhikode districts had claimed 17 lives in 2018.

They even showed their IDs.\u201d Tejashwi further stated, \"It\u2019s now clear that the Chief Minister is fully engaged in espionage. He is scared and terrified.\" Tejashwi alleged that Nitish has lost his credibility and can \"no longer manage Bihar\". \"The land survey, smart meters, paper leaks, and collapsing bridges are all signs of ongoing corruption in the state. People are frustrated with Nitish Kumar,\" he said.",

            "content": "'s form and captaincy have been the talking point in Pakistan cricket at the moment. His last century across any format came on August 30 last year when he scored 151 runs against Nepal. Babar's last century against a top team came in April 2023 in T20Is (vs New Zealand) and his last Test ton came back in December 2022, also against New Zealand. Captaincy has somehow affected his batting and former Pakistan skipper Younis Khan seems to have indirectly hinted that Babar should step down as captain to improve his performance with the bat. He also advised arguably Pakistan's best batter to prioritise fitness and work ethic. Younis gave Kohli's example who stepped down from captaincy to focus on his batting and in the process, regained his form as well. \"If Babar and other top players deliver on the field, then results will be clear to everyone. Humare players khelte kam, bolte jyada hai. (I have observed that our players tend to talk more than they perform). Look at . He chose to step down from captaincy on his own terms, and now he's breaking records worldwide. This shows that playing for the country should be the priority. If there's any energy left, then play for yourself,\" Younis said in an event. This is a clear indication from the Pakistan great to Babar Azam that he should resign from captaincy and focus on his batting just like Kohli did. Is this the only way forward for him now? Babar's numbers as captain are really good as he averages more than 60 in ODIs while leading the team and in T20Is, he averages 37.74 in 78 innings. But the same average has dropped to 46 in ODIs since January 2023 and even though his numbers in T20Is remain unperturbed during this period, Babar's runs haven't been converted to conducive results with his strike rate coming under the scanner. Kohli's record as captain was unmatched across formats but as he lost his form post-2019, he took a wise decision to leave captaincy across formats within three months from November 2021 to January 2022. He has now returned to form as well smashing 10 centuries and 19 fifties in 88 innings and amassing 3468 runs since February 2022 at an average of 45.63.",

It reported that a cleaner survived the detonation with blast trauma and is currently in hospital. As per a report by DW News, the area, where the bomb detonated, is known for its nightlife, and is full of bars and restaurants. Further, DW quoted a fire official who said they had been called to the scene, but that no extinguishing work was necessary. This is a breaking news. More details will be added.",

            "content": "Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule has distanced himself from Gaikwad\u2019s remarks, even though the BJP is part of the Shiv Sena-led government in the state. A Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad on Monday announced that he will offer Rs 11 lakh to anyone who cuts off Leader of Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tongue over his comments about ending the reservation system. Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule has distanced himself from Gaikwad\u2019s remarks, even though the BJP is part of the Shiv Sena-led government in the state. \"While he was abroad, Rahul Gandhi said that he wants to finish off the reservation system in India. This has exposed the true face of the Congres,\" Gaikwad told reporters before making his unusual offer. Gaikwad, who represents the Buldhana assembly seat in the Vidarbha region, is no stranger to controversy. Last month, a video went viral showing a policeman cleaning Gaikwad\u2019s car, which led to a flurry of social media buzz. Gaikwad later explained that the policeman had cleaned the car voluntarily after accidentally vomiting inside it. Earlier this year, Gaikwad made headlines by claiming he had hunted a tiger in 1987 and wore its tooth as a necklace. The state Forest Department then had the tooth tested for forensic identification and charged him under the Wildlife Protection Act.",

            "content": "Bajwa said that it is deeply concerning that a minister, who draws a salary funded by taxpayers, fails to comprehend the constitutional values he is sworn to uphold. Chandigarh: Leader of Opposition in Punjab, Partap Singh Bajwa, on Sunday condemned remarks made by Union Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ravneet Singh Bittu on Congress MP Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on Sikhs in the USA. Bajwa said that it is deeply concerning that a minister, who draws a salary funded by taxpayers, fails to comprehend the constitutional values he is sworn to uphold. \"His derogatory remarks demonstrate not only a profound lack of education and understanding of parliamentary principles but also an appalling disregard for responsible public conduct,\" he said. \"It appears that Bittu has completely lost his sense of reason, and perhaps it would be prudent for him to seek professional psychiatric assistance. His inability to win public trust has long been evident, yet he continues to draw a ministerial salary. Perhaps those funds could be better utilised in addressing what seems to be a deeper mental affliction. Such a baseless accusation is not merely a lapse in judgement; it is a clear manifestation of a troubling disconnect between his speech and reasoning,\" Bajwa added. The Congress leader, further urged the Government of India to take note and to ensure that those in positions of power, respect the dignity of the Constitution and the office they hold. \"Ravneet Singh Bittu's irresponsible comments are an affront to democracy and cannot be excused as mere lapses in judgement,\" Partap Singh Bajwa added. Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit slammed the Union Minister over his controversial remarks and said that his political career in the Congress was also a mess. \"We can only pity such people. His political career in Congress was also a mess. He used to praise Rahul Gandhi, and now, after resigning from Congress and joining the BJP, he is showing his loyalty to the BJP party,\" Dixit said. Congress leader Tariq Anwar said, \"Ravneet Bittu has just joined the BJP from the Congress party and he wants to prove that he follows the ideology of BJP and is anti-Rahul Gandhi. That's why he is making these kinds of absurd statements.\" Launching a blistering attack on Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi, Union Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu said on Sunday that the former is not an Indian and is the country's number one terrorist whom the agencies should catch. \"Rahul Gandhi is not an Indian, he has spent most of his time outside. He does not love his country much because he goes abroad and says everything in the wrong way. The people who are most wanted, separatists, and experts in making bombs, guns, and shells, have appreciated what Rahul Gandhi has said. The enemies of the country who try to blow up planes, trains, and roads, are in support of Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi is the country's number 1 terrorist. The biggest enemy of the country whom the agencies should catch is Rahul Gandhi today,\" he said. In another remark, Bittu said that Rahul Gandhi is trying to break a religion abroad, saying that wearing a kada, the turban is not allowed in India. \"The Gandhi family under a conspiracy raped our mothers and sisters in the streets. Bullets were fired at the Golden Temple. Thousands of innocent people were killed. Why are they teasing Sikhs? What do they want to do? He is speaking the language of terrorists like Pannun who are sitting abroad. I will speak the same when he is sitting in front of me in the parliament,\" he said.",

            "content": "Communal violence broke out in Karnataka's Mangaluru on Monday after incidents of stone-pelting on two places of worship were reported. Notably, stones were pelted in Katipalla town in Mangaluru on late Sunday night, but due to quick action, the situation came under control and no untoward incidents were reported in the area. Window panes of the place of worship were shattered, police said. According to police, the alleged stone pelters came on two bikes and sped off and following the incident, heavy police deployment has been put in place. Moreover, the Dakshina Kannada district police said they have beefed up vigils right from Uppinangady on the eastern side of Buntwal and Panemangaluru on the western side. As per the police, a case has been registered against VHP and Bajrang Dal leaders Sharan Pumpwell and Puneeth Attavar for making provocative statements. The Mangaluru police, who have been constantly monitoring the social media platforms, are taking action against those who make provocative statements. Mangaluru Police Commissioner Anupam Agarwal has already given a warning about this. On protest by VHP and Bajrang Dal in Mangaluru over a social media post, Karnataka minister and Congress leader MC Sudhakar said, \"...Mangaluru has always been a hot spot. Politics is done in Mangaluru only on the basis of communal issues. So, it is not surprising. Because on every small issue, you see what someone associated with RSS or someone else has tweeted. We cannot control everyone. There will be some miscreants in every religion. Such miscreants are creating all these issues.\" Following the incident, the Rapid Action Force has been deployed in Mangaluru to maintain order following a protest by workers from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal over a social media post on Monday. Yatish N, the Superintendent of Police (SP) for Dakshina Kannada, stated, \"Today, on the eve of Eid-e-Milad festival, we have made adequate arrangements around the district... We are ensuring that no untoward incident takes place. Whoever disturbs the peace will attract legal action.\" Eid-e-Milad marks the birth of Prophet Muhammad and is being celebrated today with processions held nationwide.",

            "description": "Elon Musk questioned why no similar threats were being made against Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.",
            "content": "Former U.S. president Donald Trump on Sunday (September 15, 2024) thanked the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement officials following an assassination attempt while he was golfing on one of his golf courses in Florida's West Palm Beach. The former president remained unharmed in what the FBI said was \"an attempted assassination\u201d while playing golf two months after another attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally. \u201cTHE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING,\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \u201cI would like to thank everyone for your concern and well wishes \u2014 It was certainly an interesting day! Most importantly, I want to thank the US Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated patriots, and, all of the law enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican nominee in the upcoming presidential election, SAFE,\u201d the presidential candidate said. Local authorities said the U.S. Secret Service agents protecting Mr. Trump fired at a man pointing an AK-style rifle with a scope while the former president was golfing with donor Steve Witkoff when shots were fired, CNN quoted a source familiar with the development as saying. President Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris were briefed and updated on the investigation. Ms. Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate and Mr. Trump's rival in the upcoming election, in a statement, said \u201cviolence has no place in America\u201d. Mr. Biden echoed that thought in his statement, adding that he had directed his team to ensure the Secret Service \"has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former president's continued safety\u201d. Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X (formerly Twitter), in his comments about attempts on Mr. Trump's life, questioned why no similar threats were being made against Mr. Biden or Ms. Harris. Mr. Musk's controversial remark came in response to a query from an X user who asked why Mr. Trump was being targeted. The Tesla CEO replied: \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing shock after the apparent assassination attempt, said: \u201cSara and I were shocked by the second assassination attempt against [former] president Trump and were relieved to hear that it too failed. But we should not rely on luck.\" \u201cWe send our best wishes to Donald and Melania along with our hopes that all measures will be taken to ensure that such deadly attacks on a candidate for the US presidency will be foiled in advance,\u201d the Israeli prime minister added. It was the latest jarring moment in the former president's life following the July 13 failed assassination attempt on Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a bullet grazed his ear. The incident spawned new questions about Secret Service protective operations after the agency's admitted failures in preventing the attempted assassination this summer. It was not immediately clear whether the development would affect Mr. Trump's campaign as he was set to speak from Florida about cryptocurrency on Monday night on the social media site. Mr. Trump has had a stepped-up security footprint since the July assassination attempt. Former presidents and their spouses have Secret Service protection for life, but the security around former presidents varies according to threat levels and exposure, with the toughest measures typically being taken in the immediate aftermath of their leaving office. Mr. Trump's protective detail has been higher than some other former presidents because of his high visibility and his campaign to seek the White House again.

England have played 398 ODIs and the Sunday clash was their 202nd T20I in women's cricket as they surpassed the likes of New Zealand and Australia to script history. New Zealand have played 558 white-ball matches while Australia have played 556, India are on fourth position with 502 matches in coloured clothing. England have 236 wins in 398 ODIs while getting over the line in 146 T20Is out of 202 matches. England have won the inaugural T20 World Cup and three ODI World Cup titles to their name. England selected a second-string side for the Ireland tour and ended up losing a match each in the ODI and T20I series. The likes of Mady Villiers and Tammy Beaumont were the stars but taking Ireland lightly did trouble England on a couple of occasions and Sunday was probably the best example of the same. England were on their way to a score in excess of 175-180. However, just 35 runs in the last four while losing four wickets shifted the momentum a bit in Ireland's favour. Ireland lost their opener Aimee Hunter quite cheaply before captain Gaby Lewis and Predergast joined forces to keep England bowlers at bay. Predergast smashed a 51-ball 80 as even though Ireland underwent a bit of a middle-order collapse, but the all-rounder had ensured that her side couldn't lose from that position. There was a harakiri at the end but Ireland got home safely and did what no other Irish team could do before in the shortest format. A few players from this squad will now join the main team in the UAE for the Women's T20 World Cup, starting on October 3.",

JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the presidential candidate from the broader front National People\u2019s Power (NPP), told a political chat show here that they would annul the project. Asked if the project posed a threat to the island nation\u2019s energy sector sovereignty, Mr. Dissanayake said, \u201cYes. We will definitely cancel it as it threatens our energy sovereignty.\u201d The JVP, which led a bloody anti-India rebellion in the island nation between 1987 and 1990 following India\u2019s direct intervention in the Lankan civil war through the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord, is believed to be leading in the unofficial polls ahead of the September 21 election . The JVP dubbed the Indo-Lanka Accord a betrayal of the nation and killed the then-ruling party members, supporters and other political activists who supported the pact signed between then-prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and J.R. Jayewardena, the President of Sri Lanka at that time. A crucial election in Sri Lanka | Explained The Adani Group has faced fundamental rights litigation in Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court after it got approval for the proposed construction of a wind power project in the island nation\u2019s northeastern regions of Mannar and Pooneryn. The Adani Group was set to invest over $440 million in the 20-year agreement for the development of 484 megawatts of wind power in the region. Editorial | Back from the brink: On the Sri Lankan elections and the road ahead Petitioners have raised environmental concerns and lack of transparency in the bidding process to grant Adani Green Energy the go-ahead.

He was a suryavanshi. A grand temple of Lord Ram has been built (in Ayodhya), but I want to tell the world that Ayodhya is moving with the target of a model solar city. The work is near completion,\u201d PM Modi said at RE-INVEST 2024. \u201cOur effort is that every household in Ayodhya runs on solar energy. We have so far connected several places with solar energy. We have identified 17 cities in the country that we can develop as solar cities,\u201d he added.

When the issue of climate change did not even emerge in the world, Mahatma Gandhi alerted the world... His life was of minimum carbon footprint... He had said that the earth has enough resources to fulfil our needs but not our greed... For us, green future and net zero are not just some fancy words but they are India's commitment... As a developing economy, we had a valid excuse to discard these commitments. We could have said that we cannot play a role in this sector. But we did not do that. We were the people who worried about the future of humanity... Today's India is creating a base for the next 1000 years,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is not just to reach the top but also to sustain at the top. India knows its energy needs and requirements to become a developed nation by 2047. We also know that we do not have our own oil and gas reserves... So we decided to build our future on solar, wind, nuclear and hydro powers...\" PM Modi added.",

            "description": "Pregnant women should take additional steps to reduce the risk of infection, such as avoiding contact with infected individuals, practising strict hygiene measures, and staying updated on the latest health advisories.",
            "content": "Pregnant women should take additional steps to reduce the risk of infection, such as avoiding contact with infected individuals, practising strict hygiene measures, and staying updated on the latest health advisories. With the World Health Organization declaring monkeypox or MPox Public Health Emergency of International Concern, Union Health Secretary Apurva Chandra on Monday issued an advisory to states and union territories regarding the precautionary actions. Doctors said that precautions need to be taken and among others, pregnant women need to exercise an added dose of caution. Dr Rekha Sukala, Consultant Obstetrician & Gynecologist, Motherhood Hospitals, Sarjapur, Bangalore, says, \"Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has become a growing public health concern in India, particularly for pregnant women, who face distinct challenges in protecting their health and that of their unborn child.\" MPox: Challenges For Pregnant Women MPox is mostly prevalent in the African continent, says Dr Rekha Sukala. \"The virus, which can lead to symptoms like fever, rash, and, in some cases, severe complications, requires increased caution during pregnancy. Pregnant women should take additional steps to reduce the risk of infection, such as avoiding contact with infected individuals, practising strict hygiene measures, and staying updated on the latest health advisories. Prompt medical consultation if symptoms appear and adherence to public health guidelines are critical in safeguarding both maternal and fetal well-being against this emerging threat,\" adds Dr Sukala. Monkeypox: Symptoms of Mpox The symptoms of Mpox, says Dr Sukala, include: \u2022 Fever \u2022 Headache \u2022 Muscle aches \u2022 Swollen lymph nodes \u2022 Exhaustion \u2022 Rash (typically starting on the face and spreading to other parts of the body). The rash progresses through various stages, turning into fluid-filled blisters that eventually crust over and fall off. Monkeypox: How Is Mpox Transmitted? Dr Sukala mentions how Mpox spreads; some of the common ways include: \u2022 Direct contact with the skin lesions, body fluids, or respiratory droplets of an infected person \u2022 Contact with contaminated objects such as bedding, towels, or clothing \u2022 In rare cases, from animals to humans through bites or direct contact with an infected animal Dr Sukala further says that for pregnant women, there's an additional concern: The virus can cross the placenta, which may lead to complications for the unborn baby. Monkeypox Risk For Pregnant Women Pregnant women may be more vulnerable to complications due to the changes in their immune systems. Dr Sukala lists the potential risks: \u2022 Severe illness \u2022 Preterm birth \u2022 Fetal infection, which can lead to congenital Mpox MPox: Preventive Measures For Pregnant Women 1. Avoid Contact with Infected Individuals: Avoid people with confirmed or suspected Mpox. 2. Practice Good Hygiene: Wash hands regularly with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand sanitiser. 3. Avoid Sharing Personal Items: Do not share bedding, towels, or other personal items with others. 4. Vaccination: Pregnant women should discuss vaccination with their doctor, especially if they are in a high-risk area or exposed to Mpox. While vaccination during pregnancy is typically safe, the decision should be individualized based on risk factors. MPox Prevention: Stay Informed Although Mpox presents a concern for pregnant women, being informed and taking preventive steps can greatly minimise the risks, says Dr Sukala. \"Staying updated on the latest health advisories, practising good hygiene, and avoiding contact with infected individuals are key measures for protection. If any symptoms arise or there is potential exposure to the virus, seeking immediate consultation with a healthcare provider is essential to ensure the safety of both mother and baby. Proactive awareness and timely medical care play a crucial role in reducing complications associated with Mpox during pregnancy,\" says Dr Rekha Sukala.",

            "content": "Nimrit Kaur Ahluwalia gets exclusively candid with Zee News as she is all set for her debut film in Punjab. New Delhi: Nimrit Kaur Ahluwalia is all set for her Punjabi debut and the actress is extremely excited about working on a different medium apart from television. Nimrit exclusively spoke to Zee News and opened up like never before. Nimrit is one of the strongest TV personalities and talking about being fearless, she says she has got it from her mom.\" The credit goes to my mother, she has been fearlessly independent and has dis just probably impacted me consciously and unconsciously to be like her. My value system is very very important for me, and I will never compromise on that.\" When asked about her debut film and the rumours about Love Sex and Dhoka 2 as her Bollywood debut, she said\" As difficult as it is to understand when it's happening to you, but anything or everything that is meant to be will come to you. When I was on the set of Shaunki, I thought I could have done it 3 years ago because I had offered the Punjabi film before. But something good for you will happen to you at the right time.\" Nimrit has largely worked on TV, we quizzed her about TV being a regressive medium and how it is often criticised for being unorganised, \" I am progressive herself, I picked up Choti Sardaarni because there was no saas-bahu drama. A lot of leading actresses were skeptical about doing Choti as it was a story of a young girl who was pregnant before her marriage and it is such a taboo in our society. It is not like progressive content is not being made, it is, but certainly, some things can change, and it can be a bit more organised. But having said that I also understand the pressure of TRPs on the producers and actors. It is not like anyone is trying to inflict misery on others on purpose. As a medium it is extremely taxing, so maybe we can look at the ways to make it organised than what it is.\" A post shared by Guru Randhawa (@gururandhawa) She further added,\" Content that might be labelled as regressive content is also being consumed by certain sections of the people in the society. Till the time as a whole does not change. The onus of bringing the change cannot be put on the producers, first as a society we should make ourselves progressive, and look at the crimes that have been happening against women surely it's because of lack of education so we need to be the change first.\" We also asked her if there is any reality on Bigg Boss and many actors refuse to be on Salman Khan's show, \"There is of course lack of reality on the reality shows, but the fact is that people do not like to see the reality. Society in general does not like to see the real people, for anyone who goes on the show is mentally prepared to be truly to themselves, people are not kind in general, and you don't want to see vulnerable people. You like to see people project something that you are not 100 per cent, even you if see social media, everyone is protecting. Nobody likes to see that someone having a shit day. To me, it's a double standard. So I wouldn't blame artists, it's people who do not want to see the reality, and try to project the best version of themselves.\" When asked about Asim Riaz's incident on Khatron Ke Khiladi, as she was also a part of the show, she said,\" It's very irrelevant in my day-to-day life, but all I want to say that what happened was very unfortunate and it doesn't happen again.\" A post shared by Nimrrit Kaur Ahluwalia (@nimritahluwalia) Nimrit talks about not doing TV anymore, \"I owe a lot of love from my TV audience, I always want to keep myself connected to them and that is the reason I did Khatron. But as an actor I want to explore and TV is like my home, so I want to grow and challenge myself to do something good. I want to do something on TV as Nimrit but not as a character at the moment. \"",

            "description": "In the first 100 days of Modi 3.0, the government has also revised rank-wise pensions under the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme for retirees from the Army, Navy, Air Force and other defence units, as well as for family pensioners, effective July 1, 2024.",
            "content": "In the first 100 days of Modi 3.0, the government has also revised rank-wise pensions under the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme for retirees from the Army, Navy, Air Force and other defence units, as well as for family pensioners, effective July 1, 2024. New Delhi: In the first 100 days of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's new term, the government has given further relief to the middle class on the tax savings and pension fronts. The government has raised the income tax exemption limit to Rs 7 lakh. The standard deduction for salaried individuals has been increased to Rs 75,000, and the exemption limit for family pensions has been raised to Rs 25,000. Also, a comprehensive review of income tax regulations is underway to simplify and streamline the tax system. According to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, within the next few months, there will be a new Tax Code or a new Income Tax Act aimed at reducing litigation. The Tax Code will be simplified in line with the three goals set by Prime Minister Modi -- seamless, painless and faceless. The Finance minister also said that 72 per cent of all the taxpayers have moved to the new and simpler tax system. As the number of income tax returns (ITRs) filed surged to a record 7.28 crore in the assessment year 2024-25, the processing time has also been reduced significantly in the last decade, which is a transformative shift in the tax assessment methodologies in the country. According to Finance Minister Sitharaman, the average processing time of ITR has been reduced from 93 days in 2013 to 10 days now, thereby making refunds faster. Meanwhile, the Union Cabinet, chaired by PM Modi, has approved the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees. This scheme will be effective from April 1, 2025. Under UPS, central government employees can choose between the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) and the National Pension Scheme (NPS). State governments will have the option of choosing between all three schemes, including the Old Pension Scheme (OPS). Under the UPS, if a government employee retires after serving for 25 years, 50 per cent of his basic salary for the last 12 months will be given as a pension. The special thing about this scheme is that it has provisions for an assured pension. If a government employee works for 10 years, at least a Rs 10,000 pension will be paid by the government with indexation benefits. There is also a provision for family pension. If the employee dies after retirement, his family members will receive 60 per cent of his pension. A lump sum amount (apart from gratuity) will also be given on retirement in UPS. It will be calculated as one-tenth of the basic salary and dearness allowance (DA) for every six months of service. More than 23 lakh Central government employees will benefit from this. In the first 100 days of Modi 3.0, the government has also revised rank-wise pensions under the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme for retirees from the Army, Navy, Air Force and other defence units, as well as for family pensioners, effective July 1, 2024.",

            "description": "Navdeep Suri brings a first person account of the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh from his grandfather\u2019s book Khooni Vaisakhi",
            "content": "In the dimly lit auditorium of the Bangalore International Centre, history came alive. On the stage, perched on a simple stool, was Navdeep Suri. Clutched in his hands was a book that held not just words, but 22 year-old Nanak Singh\u2019s haunting eyewitness account of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre preserved and translated by Navdeep from his grandfather\u2019s original work, Khooni Vaisakhi. The audience, a mix of history enthusiasts and those with a personal connection to the past, settled into their seats to be transported back to one one of the darkest days in India\u2019s fight for independence \u2014 April 13, 1919. Navdeep, began by offering some context for the excerpts he was about to read. \u201cThe beauty of the Rowlatt Act was that Gandhi ji didn\u2019t have to be a spin doctor to make people understand that it was unjust. It was so transparently malicious. The massacre was what turned him from a British loyalist to a staunch nationalist.\u201d Khooni Vaisakhi | Photo Credit:Special Arrangement As he read from his translation, the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh unfolded in chilling detail. \u201cFive-thirty sharp, the clock had struck. Thousands gathered in the Bagh, my friends,\u201d he recited, his voice echoing the despair of those trapped in the garden. \u201cUnder tyrant\u2019s orders, they opened fire straight into innocent hearts No exit, no escape, no way out was left, making Bagh a deathly trap.\u201d After each excerpt, the stage was handed over to Harpreet, a singer-songwriter who sang the original Punjabi verses of Nanak Singh\u2019s poems. The haunting lyrics, \u201cWhy open your shops today, my friends, the town will be on strike tomorrow, you\u2019ll catch a hail of bullets, my friends,\u201d filled the room. Harpreet reflected on his first performance on April 13, 2019, at the book release, \u201cThat performance was a spiritual experience. By the end, it almost felt as if I was not singing; rather someone else was singing through me.\u201d This experience led him to create a full album of Nanak Singh\u2019s poems in Khooni Vaisakhi. Navdeep Suri| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Sharing the aftermath of the massacre, Navdeep read, \u201cWith faces drawn and muffled sobs, they sift through the corpses in silent fear. Like moth on a flame, hearts burned to ashes on seeing the fate of sons so dear. My child, oh, wake up just once more. What makes you sleep in a place so grey?\u201d The emotional intensity of the event was not lost on those in attendance such as 81-year-old Brinda Syali, who also witnessed the Partition. \u201cThey created an atmosphere where we felt we were at Jalliananwala Bagh. It gave me goosebumps.\u201d For Navdeep, the significance of Khooni Vaisakhi underscored the broader historical importance of the event and the continuing need to confront and acknowledge the atrocities of the past. \u201cFirst of all, it is for us Indians to remember that freedom came at a price. One of the most egregious parts of our freedom struggle was the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\u201d The massacre also tells the world that the colonial imperial rule is not what the British or others make it out to be, Navdeep said. \u201cThe world should remember that this was the reality of their reign.\u201d As the event drew to a close, the lines of Nanak Singh\u2019s poem lingered in the minds of those present: \u201cLook closely at our bodies, sealed. A thousand wounds you\u2019ll see, oh friends. You stayed at home, reveling in your life, and desired us from your hearts, oh friends.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 12:57 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit The Hindu MetroPlus",

            "content": "Prominent among the controversies at the Olympics this year was a boxing match between Algerian Iman Khelif and Angela Carini, from Italy. The bout, which lasted all of 46 seconds, was won by Khelif and was memorable despite having little to do with pugilism. Accusations flew that she had won because she was a man and, by implication, had cheated. While Khelif was eventually vindicated, this incident was just another pit stop in the long and fractious controversy surrounding sex determination and elite sport. Are the biological categories of \u2018men\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019 sacrosanct? Is the dispute about \u2018woke\u2019 ideas contesting for publicity? How accurate is the science on sex-determination? What is the origin-story of these controversies? The Rearview is a podcast where the hosts guide you on a scenic route through the history of science. Filled with fascinating anecdotes, deep archival dives, and a closer look at the quirky minds behind groundbreaking ideas.

            "content": "The West Bengal government on Monday again invited agitating junior doctors to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's residence in Kolkata at 5 p.m. today (September 16, 2024) to hold a meeting to resolve the R.G. Kar rape case impasse. In a mail, Chief Secretary Manoj Pant said representatives of the junior doctors have been invited to the meeting. The protesting resident doctors had visited the residence of Ms. Banerjee on Saturday (September 14, 2024) for a meeting, but could not hold any discussion as the impasse over live streaming or video recording of the proceedings continued. The State government said recording or streaming cannot be allowed inside the Chief Minister\u2019s residence because of security concerns. After the last meeting was cancelled, the doctors said they had accepted all the \u2018conditions\u2019 laid out for the discussions but the authorities turned them down as it had gotten too late. \u2018Final time\u2019 In his letter to the doctors today, Chief Secretary Manoj Pant said that it was the \u201cfifth and final time\u201d the government was reaching out for a meeting. \u201cThis is the fifth and final time we are reaching out to you for a meeting between the Honourable Chief Minister and your delegates. In line with our discussion from the day before, we are once again inviting you to a meeting with the Honourable Chief Minister at her Kalighat residence for a discussion with an open mind,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe trust that good sense will prevail, and as mutually agreed and as per your statement to the media day before \u2014 there will be no live streaming or videography of the meeting, given that the matter is subjudice in the highest court of the country. Instead, the minutes of the meeting will be recorded and signed by both parties,\u201d he added. He invited the same delegation that arrived on Saturday to reach the Chief Minister\u2019s home at 4.45 p.m. The agitating junior doctors continued their sit-in outside Swasthya Bhawan, the headquarters of the health department, for the eight day and cease work for the 36th day.

            "description": "Omkar Music School is all set to celebrate its 10th anniversary with a grand musical festival",
            "content": "The upcoming three-day Omkar Music Fest at Prestige Shantiniketan, marks the 10th anniversary of Omkar Music School led by Hindustani vocalist Iman Das. In the past decade, the school has trained nearly a thousand students across the globe. While the celebrations will see performances from youngsters on all days, one can expect performances from star artistes such as sitarist Ustad Shafique Khan from Dharwad and Partha Bose from Kolkata, a tabla solo by Ustad Najmuddin Javed, Mohiniyattam and Kathak performances by Rekha Raju and Snigda DS respectively, and a presentation of thumri, dadra, kajri and chalti from Iman Das himself. Iman says he is happy that Hindustani vocalist and Muddu Mohan, a retired IAS officer, and disciple of Basavaraj Rajguru and Gangubhai Hangal, will be performing at the festival this year. \u201cThis annual fest is growing by the year and we have nearly 50 artistes participating in the three-day festival. Apart from a wide range of music and dance styles, including bhajans and bhavageete, there will also be a painting competition for children themed around music.\u201d Shafique Khan| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Santoor maestro Madan Oak will be coming from the US for the occasion, and a team trained by Carnatic veena expert Suma Sudhindra will be performing as will electric guitarist Swarnabha Gupta from Pune. Amongst Iman\u2019s senior students who will be participating in the event are Hindustani vocalists Asmita Banerjee and Ankita Kundu. Iman, who undertook advanced lessons from Pt. Ajay Chakrabarty (a student of Munawwar Ali Khan) and Pt. Shantanu Bhattacharya, today has students from around the world. \u201cEach gharana brings a new approach to music, its interpretation or form, embellishing the existing structure. My lineage belongs to the Patiala gharana.\u201d Seed of a dream \u201cI want to see if the IT city of Bengaluru can be a parallel IC (Indian Classical) city and I am working towards this from our Academy.\u201d One of the aspects of the Omkar Music Academy, Iman adds, is the housing of lessons that discusses all systems of world music, apart from Indian classical Hindustani which is taught in all its forms here. \u201cI have a lot of Western music enthusiasts as my students and the best way to teach them is to make them sing in their own genre, even as I follow the Indian system of swaras and ragas. No other system can do this except our Sur-based musical scale that can be notated in its exactitude.\u201d Any world genre can be notated, Iman says, through the Sur-based seven notes and this system helps students of other genres understand the melodic framework and tonality of a piece. \u201cAt our music school we get students to cherish and value Indian musical systems.\u201d Iman Das| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Brought up in Kolkata, Iman Das settled in Bengaluru after his work received a good response from the city that, \u201cembraces new aspects of culture and music with a broader acceptance.\u201d A love for new ragas Iman\u2019s penchant for new ragas and composing began in childhood when he was drawn to sitarist Pandit Ravishankar\u2019s innovative masterpiece, Raag Parameshwari. \u201cThe scale just haunts you; when I wrote a musical on Devi Indira, believed to be an incarnation of Meerabhai, I used it for the song \u2018Maa Meera\u2019.\u201d The track became an instant hit and was acknowledged by WNYR New York Radio in the \u2018World\u2019s Top Emerging Artistes\u2019 category for special song /Sanskrit shloka. \u201cThe fusion of two great scales here make it an interesting study for learners to contemplate its winding flow,\u201d he says. His own raga innovations have been Swarnadesi, Vishwa Bahar and Swarnamadhu that artistes such as Anup Jalota, Amit Kumar, Venkatesh Kumar and others have appreciated.

The case was registered following a complaint from actor Rohini to the City Police Commissioner A. Arun. Ms. Rohini is the president of the gender sensitisation and internal complaints committee (ICC) of South Indian Artists\u2019 Association (SIAA). In her complaint, which was lodged on Friday (September 13, 2024,) she said Kantharaj had demeaned women with his obscene words. Stating that the interview had shown the women in the film industry in a poor light, she sought that the police register a criminal complaint against Kantharaj and initiate steps to remove the video from YouTube. The complaint was forwaded to the Cyber Crime Wing for further action, and a case was registered against Kantharaj under Sections 296 (Obscene Acts) 75(1)(iv) (Making Sexually Coloured Remarks) 79(Word, gesture, or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 352 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and Section 67 (Punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act.

            "content": "The Railway Ministry renamed the Vande Metro hours before launch by PM Modi in Gujarat. Hours before the flagging off ceremony of the Bhuj-Ahmedabad Vande Metro, the Railway Ministry renamed it to Namo Bharat Rapid Rail on Monday, a ministry spokesperson said. The metro service will be launched from the Bhuj railway station at 4:15 p.m. virtually by Prime Minister Modi, who will be present in Ahmedabad. Namo Bharat Rapid Rail Renamed: Details The Rapid Rail, designed to improve intercity connectivity, is set to traverse a 359 km route between Bhuj and Ahmedabad in 5 hours and 45 minutes, with scheduled stops at nine stations along the way. The regular service will be made available for the public from September 17 Ahmedabad. The journey is expected to cost Rs 455 for the complete route. The Railway Ministry has announced that the Vande Metro will be renamed Namo Bharat Rapid Rail, according to a spokesperson. Unlike other metro trains that cover shorter routes, Namo Bharat will link central Ahmedabad with nearby cities, the ministry stated. The Rapid Rail, equipped with 12 coaches and seating for 1,150 passengers, boasts several modern features. According to officials, it includes ergonomically designed seats, fully air-conditioned cabins, and modular interiors, making it a more advanced option compared to other metro trains. \"The train offers faster journeys between mid-distance cities. Its rapid acceleration and deceleration contribute to efficient travel while driving cabs at both ends eliminates turnaround time,\" it added. (With PTI inputs)",

            "description": "Costume designer Anu Parthasarathy speaks about collaborating with Vidya Balan and their creative journey for the project, A Recreation of Iconic Styles, which pays tribute to renowned Carnatic singer MS Subbulakshmi.",
            "content": "In 1951, MS Subbulakshmi made her way to Nalli Silks with a blue thread in hand, hoping to have a sari made of the same colour. The colour of the sari then specially woven for her, was so unique that it went on to be referred to as MS Blue. Till date, people walk into silk sari stores, referring to MS Blue, seeking out the exact same shade of inky, iridescent blue. In a tribute to the legendary Carnatic singer, whose voice, and sartorial sense has inspired generations since, actor Vidya Balan collaborated with Chennai-based costume designer Anu Parthasarthy, who has worked on several films across languages, for a photographic tribute to mark MS Subbulakshmi\u2019s 108th birth anniversary. \u201cGrowing up, my mom would play \u2018Suprabhatam\u2019 sung by her, first thing in the morning. My everyday still begins with her voice. For me, MS Subbulakshmi is a spiritual experience. Therefore, this has been a labour of love, and an honour to be able to pay tribute this way,\u201d Vidya says. Anu Parthasarathy with Vidya Balan| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement The idea for this project, titled A Recreation of Iconic Styles, began nearly seven years ago. \u201cThis came from a casual conversation I had with Vidya, where she was telling me how she would love to play the singer in a biopic, if the opportunity came up. I was also keen on doing something out of the box, and kept coming back to this conversation we had,\u201d Anu recalls, of their creative journey. She had previously worked on Vidya\u2019s costumes for Bhool Bhulaiyaa , and Guru . \u201cI was able to visualise Vidya as a younger MS amma and began to work on the look. They both have similarly beautiful, pear-shaped faces. Vidya\u2019s ability to embody a character completely, also made her the ideal choice for this,\u201d she says. Having met MS Subbulakshmi in the past, Anu recalls being mesmerised by her grace and poise. \u201cSomething that also struck me was how unique her sari drape was. It looked like a nine yards sari, but was actually six yards. Her saris were all in traditional, bright colours, and remain iconic to this day,\u201d she says. While she got started with looking at images available online and in books, Anu credits renowned flautist Mala Chandrasekhar, the granddaughter-in-law of MS Subbulakshmi for her invaluable insights and guidance through the process of putting together four different looks for the photos, shot by Rohn Pingalay. \u201cMany photos, for instance, were in black and white. But Mala ma\u2019am helped me identify the right colours and shades for the saris. I learnt from her that the singer used to wear saris woven by Muthu Chettiar, a weaver from Madurai in the early days, and later, saris from Nalli Chinnasami Chetty,\u201d she says. The creative journey involved meticulous research by Anu for the saris she wore during the Sixties and the Seventies. Vidya Balan as MS Subbulakshmi in the iconic MS Blue sari| Photo Credit:Rohn Pingalay From a number of saris that are considered favourites, four were chosen for the photo tribute, each significant in its own way. The iconic MS blue sari that Vidya wore was sourced from the original weaver Nalli Chinnasami Chetty in Chennai. While celebrated through the years, the uniqueness of the saris worn by the singer also meant having to go the custom route, to get it recreated. Anu says that Subhashini Srinivasan, proprietrix and design head, The S Studio Clothing coordinated the weaving process for the three other saris.

For the recreation series, the sari was woven by D Srinivasan from Sri Balavinayagar Silks in Kanchipuram. Vidya in a recreation of the blue pearl square sari| Photo Credit:Rohn Pingalay The striking blue pearl square sari (muthu kattam sari), which as its name suggests, features pearl squares on the body. \u201cUnlike today\u2019s saris which have a broad zari or many lines of zari on the border, the saris of that period maintained a more simplistic style which added to its allure. This was a concert favourite,\u201d Anu said, of the sari, which was recreated by weaver V Balakrishnan in Kanchipuram. In a recreation of the Ramar green sari| Photo Credit:Rohn Pingalay Of the popular Ramar Pacchai (green) sari with a mustard yellow border which was recreated by weaver D Srinivasan, Anu recalls struggling to find the right shade, and going through several samples before zeroing in on the right colours. \u201cMala ma\u2019am had a similar silk cotton sari, and gave me a piece of fabric from it which I used as a reference. This is a popular colour as well, something you can hear being asked for in sari shops. The original sari had a fascinating dual combination of sea-green and middle-sea blue with a mustard oil border colour,\u201d Anu says, adding that two weavers were needed to operate the loom simultaneously to achieve these contrasting colours. From the size of the ring on her left ring finger, the much loved mookuthi or nose studs she sported on her nose, her hair in a bun adorned with flowers, and the exact shade of kumkum on her forehead were other aspects of the look that they worked on. Her simple accessories complimented the vibrant, bright saris she used to wear. \u201cMS Subbulakshmi\u2019s simple stage persona would always shine through, and we had to keep this in mind while recreating her looks,\u201d says Anu. The photographic tribute and Vidya\u2019s portrayal of MS Subbalakshmi is not merely a superficial imitation, but a deep appreciation for the singer\u2019s artistry, the team that worked on this tribute said.

            "content": "India's superstar athlete ended the 2024 season at the second spot by a margin of 1 cm in the Diamond League final. He threw his javelin 87.86m long in his third attempt while the eventual winner Anderson Peters came up with an 87.87m throw. After the event, Neeraj took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal that he had fractured the fourth metacarpal of his left hand but was able to play with the help of his team. The main question that arises here is - Was there a need to play for Neeraj Chopra with an injury? Was the Diamond League tournament so important for him? Paris Olympics gold medallist Arshad Nadeem hasn't participated in any of the tournaments since the Games while the defending champion of the Diamond League, Jakub Vadlejch, also withdrew from the final for unknown reasons. Neeraj's closest competitors didn't feature in the Diamond League while the 26-year-old participated in the last round to make it to the final at the fourth place. It is well known to everyone that Neeraj struggled with a groin injury before the Olympics and managed it during the Games too. He had to settle for a silver medal eventually with Pakistan's Arshad recording the all-time Olympics throw. He is set to undergo the surgery for the same soon and the fresh injury to his left hand is likely to make the recovery period long for Neeraj. In this situation, should Neeraj have skipped playing after the Olympics? Has he risked aggravating both his injuries by participating in the Diamond League? Well, only time will tell whether his recovery period will be extended. Neeraj Chopra himself cleared in his tweet that he wanted to finish the season on track and also admitted that he couldn't meet his expectations this season. Well, then he will be gunning to return fully fit next year and breach that 90m mark that eluded him throughout the 2024 season. 88.35m at Doha Diamond League - 2nd place (May 10) 82.27m at Federation Cup, India - 1st place (May 15) 85.97m at Paavo Nurmi Games - 1st place (June 18) 89.34m at Paris 2024 Olympics (Qualification) - August 6 89.45m at Paris 2024 Olympics (Final) - August 8 89.49m at Lausanne Diamond League - 2nd place (August 22) 87.86m at Brussels Diamond League (Final) - 2nd place (September 14)",

            "content": "Following a complaint by a Class XII student of a government-aided school at Chennimalai that he was slapped by the headmaster for questioning a teacher, School Education Department officials on Monday began their inquiries with the headmaster, teacher and students. The incident reportedly took place on September 13, Friday, and the boy took up the issue with his parents who lodged a complaint with the Chief Educational Officer T. Sampath. Officials said the complaint was that the commerce teacher had erased the lessons she wrote on the blackboard and the boy could not copy it down in his notebook. When he raised the issue with the teacher, she took up the issue with the headmaster who allegedly slapped the boy. The boy fell down and he was sent home, officials said. His parents admitted him to the Government Headquarters Hospital in Erode and took up the issue with the CEO. However, no police complaint was lodged. Mr. Sampath told The Hindu that a departmental inquiry has begun on Monday and based on the report, further action would be taken.

            "content": "RG Kar Medical College's former principal Sandip Ghosh was found to be \"deceptive\" while answering important questions on the rape and murder of a trainee woman postgraduate doctor during his polygraph test and layered voice analysis, officials said. The CBI, probing the case, arrested Ghosh on September 2 in connection with financial irregularities at the hospital. The federal probe agency later added charges of evidence tampering against him. During the investigation, Ghosh was subjected to layered voice analysis and polygraph test. According to a report from Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), New Delhi, his version has been found to be \"deceptive on certain important issues\" relating to this case, officials in the know of the developments said. Information revealed during the polygraph test may not be used as evidence during the trial but the agency may gather corroborative evidence which could be used in court, they said. Also read | Former R.G. Kar hospital principal had criminal nexus with co-accused for wrongful gains: CBI A polygraph test can help in assessing inaccuracies in the statements of suspects and witnesses. By monitoring their psychological responses, heart rate, breathing pattern, sweating and blood pressure, investigators can determine if there are discrepancies in their responses. The CBI has alleged that Ghosh got information about the rape and murder of the trainee doctor at 9.58 am on August 9 but he did not make the police complaint immediately. He allegedly made a \"vague complaint\" at a later stage through the medical superintendent-vice principal even though the victim was declared dead at 12.44 p.m., they said. \"He did not try to get an FIR lodged immediately. Rather a new theory of suicide was introduced which is not possible as per external injury visible on the body of the victim that was undressed at the lower part,\" the CBI has alleged. The probe agency has alleged that Ghosh got in touch with Tala Police Station's Officer In Charge (OC) Abhijit Mondal at 10.03 a.m. and with an advocate at 1.40 p.m. while a case of unnatural death was registered at 11.30 pm. Mondal, who has also been arrested by CBI in connection with the case, received information of the incident at 10.03 a.m. on August 9 but did not reach the scene of the crime immediately, the officials claimed, adding the OC reached the spot after an hour. The general diary entry 542 mentioned that the body of the PG trainee of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital was found lying in an \"unconscious state\" in the seminar room of chest medicine, whereas the body was already examined by a doctor who had found the victim dead. The general diary entry was allegedly made \"in conspiracy with hospital authorities and other unknown persons\", intentionally mentioning wrong details. Mondal's failure to register an FIR and protect the scene of crime resulted in the \"damage of vital evidence available at the crime scene\", officials said, adding he tried to protect the accused Sanjay Roy and others who had unauthorised access to the scene of crime that might have led to tampering of evidence. Ghosh allegedly directed subordinates to send the body to the morgue hurriedly, they said. The trainee doctor was allegedly raped and murdered in the seminar hall of R G Kar Medical College and Hospital when she had gone to rest during her shift in the early hours of August 9. Her body with severe injury marks was found in the hall by a doctor who was on rounds. Sanjay Roy, a police volunteer, was arrested the next day based on CCTV footage in which he was seen entering the seminar hall at 4.03 a.m. on the day of the incident. On August 13, the Calcutta High Court ordered the transfer of the probe from the Kolkata Police to the CBI, which took over the case on August 14.

            "content": "West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee again invited the protesting doctors for meeting at 5 pm to break the deadlock. In a letter, Bengal Chief Secretary requested the agitating doctors to meet Mamata Banerjee at her Kalighat residence for a \"discussion with an open mind\". \"We trust that good sense will prevail, and as mutually agreed and as per your statement to the media day before, there will be no live streaming or videography of the meeting, given that the matter is sub judice in the highest court of the country. Instead, the minutes of the meeting will be recorded and signed by both parties,\" the letter said. The development comes at a time when the agitating junior doctors continued with their cease work, stating that they would remain steadfast in their resolve to pursue justice for the medic raped and murdered at the RG Kar hospital. For the eight day on Monday, the doctors continued their sit-in outside Swasthya Bhawan, the headquarters of the Health department, and contonued cease work for the 36th day and vowed to continue it till their demands - the removal of Kolkata Police Commissioner and senior state health officials are met. \"We will continue our cease work till our demands are met. The state government is not serious about resolving the crisis,\" an agitating junior medic said. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on Saturday made a surprise visit to the site where the doctors were protesting and assured them that their demands would be addressed, but the proposed meeting fell through, with the protesters claiming that they were asked to leave \"unceremoniously\" after waiting for three hours at the gates of the CM's residence. Another protesting doctor claimed they had agreed to attend the meeting without live-streaming or video recording as Banerjee requested, but after notifying Minister of State for Health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, of this decision, they were told to leave because it was too late. A few previous attempts at talks between the junior doctors and Banerjee had also failed due to disagreements over live streaming of the meetings and the number of attending representatives. The body of the postgraduate woman doctor was recovered in the seminar hall of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been conducting the probe into the rape and murder of the woman medic, following a Calcutta High Court order.",

            "content": "PWD Minister Satish Jarkiholi has called out Prime Minister Narendra Modi for singling out the violence at Nagamangala during the Ganesha celebrations in Karnataka. \u201cIt is not fair on the part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to point out the violent incident in Nagamangala and comment that the State Government has failed to maintain law and order. There are over 60,000 Ganesha idols installed across Karnataka, and the celebrations are on in full swing. It is a single isolated incident. The police officers will handle it effectively. We should not blow it out of proportion,\u201d he told reporters in Belagavi on September 15. To a query, Satish Jarkiholi said that the arrest of BJP MLA Munirathna was not politically motivated. \u201cHe has been seen using abusive language against some persons, including some women. Did the Congress ask him to do that? It is wrong to say that the arrest is politically motivated,\u201d he said. He said that the financial burden on the Belagavi city corporation had been reduced as the urban local body had decided to return land to the owners rather than take up work of widening a road.

The villagers were seen going with their belongings, including livestock, in vans. According to officials, these villagers are \"illegal settlers in the tribal belt\". \u201cMost of the alleged encroachers have land in other districts, such as Darrang, Morigaon and Barpeta and have started returning to their homes there,\u201d the officials said. The Kamrup (Metropolitan) district authorities have set September 16 as a deadline to vacate the Kochutoli village. \u201cEviction notices were served to those \u201cillegally occupying government land\u201d and stringent action would be taken against those who would remain there after the deadline,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cA team from the Sonapur Circle office and the police had gone to Kochutoli village to evict Bengali-speaking Muslim villagers, who had previously been removed from the encroached land but had again returned there,\u201d he said. During the eviction drive, the villagers, including women, had attacked the officials and policemen with sharp weapons, sticks and stones on September 12. Two villagers were killed and more than 35 people, including 22 government officials and police personnel, were injured in the violence. The police opened fire to disperse the mob. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the laws related to the tribal belts and blocks were promulgated when Gopinath Bordoloi was the first Congress CM in 1950 and this particular area has been under the tribal belt since then. Mr. Sarma had said the eviction drive in the area would continue. ''We will clear the tribal belts and blocks of all encroachment by doubtful illegal settlers,\" he said. He had alleged that the Congress \"instigated people to come out and attack the officials and police personnel on duty'', Mr. Sarma said. Director General of Police G. P. Singh said the attack on police personnel was suspected to be a case of ''conspiracy'' by a certain section as the eviction was continuing peacefully since September 9. Meanwhile, separate delegations of the Congress and AIUDF MLAs were prevented by pro-eviction tribal organisations from entering the village on Saturday (September 14, 2024.) The Congress alleged that the State Government has \"violated court orders by not issuing relevant notice for eviction from Government land as there is a ruling by both the Supreme Court and Gauhati High Court in this regard\".

            "description": "The border controls will be in place for an initial six months and are expected to include temporary structures at land crossings and spot checks by federal police; interior ministry however noted that travellers should carry identification when crossing the border",
            "content": "Germany will expand border controls to the frontiers from Monday (September 16, 2024) with all nine of its neighbours to stop irregular migrants in a move that has sparked protests from other European Union members. Berlin announced the sweeping measure following a string of deadly extremist attacks that have stoked public fears and boosted support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party . Interior Minister Nancy Faeser on Sunday (September 15, 2024) said that the step aimed to limit irregular migration and \"put a stop to criminals and identify and stop Islamists at an early stage\". The border controls will be in place for an initial six months and are expected to include temporary structures at land crossings and spot checks by federal police. Poland and Austria have voiced concern and the European Commission has warned that members of the 27-nation bloc must only impose such steps in exceptional circumstances. Germany lies at the heart of Europe and borders nine countries that are part of the visa-free Schengen zone , designed to allow the free movement of people and goods. Border controls with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland were already in place before the crackdown was announced. These will now be expanded to Germany's borders with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Faeser said the government hoped to minimise the impact on people living and working in border regions, promising \"coordination with our neighbouring countries\". The interior ministry however noted that travellers should carry identification when crossing the border. Islamist attacks In recent weeks, a string of extremist attacks have shocked Germany, fuelling rising public anger. Last month, a man on a knife rampage killed three people and wounded eight more at a festival in the western city of Solingen. The Syrian suspect, who has alleged links to the Islamic State group, had been intended for deportation but managed to evade authorities. The enforcement failure set off a bitter debate which marked the run-up to two regional polls in the formerly communist east, where the anti-immigration AfD scored unprecedented results. With national elections looming next year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government has been under intense political pressure to toughen its stance on migrants and asylum seekers. Mr. Scholz was in Uzbekistan on Sunday to sign a migration deal for workers to come to Germany, while simplifying deportation procedures in the opposite direction so that \"those that must go back do go back\", the chancellor said. Closer to home, the German government has presented plans to speed up deportations to European partners. Under EU rules, asylum requests are meant to be handled by the country of arrival. The system has placed a huge strain on countries on the European periphery, where leaders have demanded more burden-sharing. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that Germany tightening its borders means that it would \"essentially pass the buck to countries located on the outer borders of Europe\". Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said his country \"will not accept people who are rejected from Germany\", while Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk condemned Germany's move as \"unacceptable\". 'Welcome to the club' Warsaw has also struggled with migration and accused Moscow of smuggling people from Africa and the Middle East into Europe by sending them through Belarus to the Polish border. Berlin on Friday said that Mr. Tusk and Mr. Scholz had discussed the issue and agreed to strengthen EU external borders, \"especially in view of the cynical instrumentalisation of migrants by Belarus\". Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, meanwhile, mocked the German chancellor on social media site X, writing: \"Bundeskanzler Scholz, welcome to the club! #StopMigration.\" Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-16, many of them Syrians, and has hosted over a million Ukrainians since the start of the Russian invasion in 2022. The extra burden on municipal authorities and integration services in Germany needed to be \"taken into account\" when talking about new border controls, Berlin's interior ministry said. In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Dick Schoof on Friday unveiled the country's strictest migration policy yet, saying it will request an opt-out from EU common policy on asylum next week. A four-party coalition dominated by far-right firebrand Geert Wilders's Freedom Party wants to declare an \"asylum crisis\" to curb the influx of migrants through a tough set of rules including border controls.

            "content": "Indian Railways has officially renamed the Vande Metro service to \"Namo Bharat Rapid Rail,\" signalling a shift in branding for one of the country\u2019s key upcoming rail projects. The renaming comes hours ahead of the inauguration of the Bhuj-Ahmedabad Vande Metro in Gujarat. The service will be flagged off from the Bhuj railway station at 4:15 pm virtually by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who will be present in Ahmedabad, as per an official. As per the information, the change in name is seen as part of a larger initiative to align infrastructure projects with the \"Namo Bharat\" vision, which symbolises the broader mission of rapid development under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. The Namo Bharat Rapid Rail is expected to focus on regional connectivity, offering a faster alternative to traditional trains, and easing congestion on busy city routes. The project is being developed under the larger National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), and its implementation will involve collaboration with various state governments to create high-speed corridors between urban centres.",

            "content": "The Railway Ministry has renamed the Bhuj-Ahmedabad Vande Metro to Namo Bharat Rapid Rail hours before its inaugural run on Monday (September 16, 2024), according to a spokesperson. The service will be flagged off from the Bhuj railway station at 4:15 p.m. virtually by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who will be present in Ahmedabad, he said. The Rapid Rail, which aims to enhance intercity connectivity, will cover 359 km distance from Bhuj to Ahmedabad in 5:45 hours. In between, the train will stop at nine stations. For the public, the regular service will start on September 17 from Ahmedabad. The total journey will cost \u20b9455. \"The ministry has decided to rename Vande Metro to Namo Bharat Rapid Rail,\" the Railway spokesperson said. According to the Railway Ministry, while the other metros cover only short distances, Namo Bharat trains will connect the heart of Ahmedabad with its peripheral cities. Featuring 12 coaches with seating for 1,150 passengers, the Rapid Rail offers a host of innovative features, it said. \"With ergonomically designed seats, fully air-conditioned cabins and modular interiors, it definitely proves to be superior to other metros.\" A significant upgrade, according to the Ministry, from traditional suburban trains and metro coaches is its modular design that includes ejector-based vacuum evacuation toilets. \"The train offers faster journeys between mid-distance cities. Its rapid acceleration and deceleration contribute to efficient travel while driving cabs at both ends eliminates turnaround time,\" it added.

            "description": "The U.S. government and TikTok will go head-to-head in federal court on Monday as oral arguments begin in a consequential legal case that will determine the future of TikTok in the country",
            "content": "The U.S. government and TikTok will go head-to-head in federal court on Monday as oral arguments begin in a consequential legal case that will determine if \u2013 or how \u2014 a popular social media platform used by nearly half of all Americans will continue to operate in the country. Attorneys for the two sides will appear before a panel of judges at the federal appeals court in Washington. TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, are challenging a U.S. law that requires them to break ties or face a ban in the U.S. by mid-January. The legal battle is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was a culmination of a years-long saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China. But TikTok argues the law runs afoul of the First Amendment while other opponents claim it mirrors crackdowns sometimes seen in authoritarian countries abroad. In court documents submitted over the summer, the Justice Department emphasised the government\u2019s two primary concerns. First, TikTok collects vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Second, the U.S. says the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. TikTok has repeatedly said it does not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government and that concerns the government has raised have never been substantiated. In court documents, attorneys for both TikTok and its parent company have argued that members of Congress sought to punish the platform based on propaganda they perceived to be on TikTok. The companies also claimed divestment is not possible and that the app would have to shut down by January 19 if the courts don\u2019t step in to block the law. \u201cEven if divestiture were feasible, TikTok in the United States would still be reduced to a shell of its former self, stripped of the innovative and expressive technology that tailors content to each user,\u201d the companies said in a legal brief filed in June. \u201cIt would also become an island, preventing Americans from exchanging views with the global TikTok community.\u201d Opponents of the law stress a ban would also cause disruptions in the world of marketing, retail and in the lives of many different content creators, some of whom also sued the government in May. TikTok is covering the legal costs for that lawsuit, which the court has consolidated with the company\u2019s complaint and another filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Though the government\u2019s primary reasoning for the law is public, significant portions of its court filings include classified information that has been redacted and hidden from public view. The companies have asked the court to reject the secret filings or appoint a district judge who can ferret through the material, which the government has opposed because it will cause a delay in the case. If admitted into the court, legal experts say those secret filings could make it nearly impossible to know some of the factors that could play a part in the eventual ruling. In one of the redacted statements submitted in late July, the Justice Department claimed TikTok took direction from the Chinese government about content on its platform, without disclosing additional details about when or why those incidents occurred. Casey Blackburn, a senior U.S. intelligence official, wrote in a legal statement that ByteDance and TikTok \u201chave taken action in response\u201d to Chinese government demands \u201cto censor content outside of China.\u201d Though the intelligence community had \u201cno information\u201d that this has happened on the platform operated by TikTok in the U.S., Blackburn said there is a risk it \u201cmay\u201d occur. In a separate document submitted to court, the DOJ said the U.S. is \u201cnot required to wait until its foreign adversary takes specific detrimental actions before responding to such a threat.\u201d The companies, however, argue the government could have taken a more tailored approach to resolve its concerns. During high-stakes negotiations with the Biden administration more than two years ago, TikTok presented the government with a draft 90-page agreement that allows a third party to monitor the platform\u2019s algorithm, content moderation practices and other programming. TikTok says it has spent more than $2 billion to voluntarily implement some of these measures, which include storing U.S. user data on servers controlled by the tech giant Oracle. But it said a deal was not reached because government officials essentially walked away from the negotiating table in August 2022. Justice officials have argued complying with the draft agreement is impossible, or would require extensive resources, due to the size and the technical complexity of TikTok. The Justice Department also said the only thing that would resolve the government\u2019s concerns is severing the ties between TikTok and ByteDance given the porous relationship between the Chinese government and Chinese companies. But some observers have wondered whether such a move would accelerate the so-called \u201cdecoupling\u201d between the U.S. and its strategic rival at a time when other China-founded companies, such as Shein and Temu, are also making a big splash in the West. Last week, the Biden administration proposed rules that would crack down on duty-free products being shipped directly from China. For its part, ByteDance has publicly said TikTok is not up for sale. But that has not stopped some investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, from announcing bids to purchase the platform. However, even if such a sale would occur, it would most likely be devoid of TikTok's coveted algorithm, leaving a big question mark on whether the platform would be capable of serving up the type of personally tailored videos that users have come to expect. The political alignments on the issue are playing out in unconventional ways. The law, which passed with bipartisan approval in Congress, had encountered resistance from some progressive and Republican lawmakers who voiced concerns about giving the government the power to ban a platform used by 170 million Americans. Former President Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok while in office, is now opposing a ban because that would help its rival, Facebook, a platform Trump continues to criticise over his 2020 election loss. In court, free speech and social justice groups have submitted amicus briefs in support of TikTok, arguing it restricts the First Amendment rights of users and suppresses the speech of minority communities by disrupting a tool many of them use to advocate for causes online. Some libertarian groups with ties to ByteDance investor Jeff Yass have also filed briefs supporting the company. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has received the backing of more than 20 Republican attorneys general, former national security officials and China-focused human rights groups who are asking the court to uphold the law.

            "content": "Indian police have detained around 100 striking workers and union leaders protesting low wages at a Samsung Electronics plant in Chennai, as they were planning a march on Monday (September 16, 2024) without permission, police officials said. The detention marks an escalation of a strike by workers at a Samsung home appliance plant near Chennai. Workers want higher wages and have boycotted work for seven days, disrupting production that contributes roughly a third of Samsung's annual India revenue of $12 billion. A senior police official of Kancheepuram district, Sankar Ganesh, told Reuters by telephone that around 100 workers were under \"preventive arrest\", without elaborating. Another police officer on condition of anonymity said the detentions were made due to a lack of permission to hold a protest march. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment. Workers have since last week been protesting at a makeshift tent near the plant, demanding higher wages, recognition for a union backed by labour group Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and better working hours. Samsung is not keen to recognise any union backed by an outside labour group. A. Jenitan, a union leader of CITU, told Reuters that police also detained one of their senior leaders, E. Muthukumar, who was leading the Samsung protests. \"The workers have been asked to return to the (strike) tent,\" he said.

New Delhi: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a heavy security entourage around him that even follows him to the bathroom of the X (formerly) headquarters, a New York Times report has revealed. A security team- which consists of 20 personnel guard the billionaire tech magnate that is being called by the name \u201cVoyager\u201d. \"Mr. Musk, who was once flanked by two bodyguards, travels with as many as 20 security professionals who show up to research escape routes or to clear a room before he enters. They often carry guns and have a medical professional in tow for Mr. Musk, who has been code-named \u201cVoyager\u201d by his security team,\" the New York Times reported. Elon Musk's Company has paid millions of dollars for providing tight security to the tech billionaire. The New York Times has accessed invoices and receipts that said, \"This year, Tesla disclosed in filings for the first time that it paid $2.4 million for a portion of Mr. Musk\u2019s protection in 2023. It paid $500,000 in the first two months of 2024, more than five times the average spent every two months in 2019, according to Tesla documents. From 2015 to 2018, Mr. Musk spent an average $145,000 a month on security\". The Tesla and SpaceX CEO had in 2022 created a lot of tumult among Twitter user by posting a very cryptic tweet on death. Musk referred to dying under under \"mysterious circumstances\". Musk tweeted, \"If I die under mysterious circumstances, it's been nice knowin ya\". If I die under mysterious circumstances, it\u2019s been nice knowin ya\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2022 Though the Tech billionaire is well known for his baffling posts on Twitter, the above quote seems to have some relation to the tweet Musk had posted before the \"mysterious circumstances\" quote. The word \u201cNazi\u201d doesn\u2019t mean what he seems to think it does pic.twitter.com/pk9SQhBOsG \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2022 In the above post, that appears to be a communication from a Russian officer, Musk shares excerpts of some strong warning of sorts. The post warns how Musk \"will be held accountable\" for his involvement in \"supplying the fascist forces in Ukraine with military communication equipment\". \"Elon Musk, thus, is involved in supplying the fascist forces in Ukraine with military communication equipment. And for this, Elon, you will be held accountable like an adult - no matter how much you'll play the fool,\" said the last para of the post.",

In India, where discussions about periods are still considered taboo in many communities, this silence has done more harm than good. Menstruation is a natural, biological process, but for many women, it is surrounded by myths, shame, and lack of support. Matri, a revolutionary startup, is not only providing an effective solution to period pain with Matri's Period Pain Relief Device, but also challenging and dismantling the deeply ingrained taboos surrounding menstruation in India.",

            "content": "With two goals in less than 10 minutes, Lamine Yamal led Barcelona to its fifth straight victory at the start of the Spanish league season. The teenager's double, plus second-half goals from Dani Olmo and Pedri, gave Barcelona a commanding 4-1 win at Catalan rival Girona on Sunday (September 15, 2024), keeping a four-point lead at the top. Atletico Madrid kept pace by beating last-place Valencia 3-0 with goals from Antoine Griezmann and newly signed players Julia\u0301n A\u0301lvarez and Conor Gallagher, while Real Madrid had won 2-0 at Real Sociedad on Saturday with goals from Kylian Mbappe\u0301 and Vini\u0301cius Ju\u0301nior. Along with Atletico and Madrid, Villarreal was the other team four points behind Barcelona after winning 2-1 at Mallorca on Saturday. \u201cTo help the team it's important to score the goals and to do whatever is needed,\u201d Yamal said. \u201cThe first match after the international break is always complicated. Now we can start focusing on the match against Monaco (in the Champions League on Thursday).\u201d Yamal's goals on Sunday were his second and third of the season. The 17-year-old Spain international opened the scoring after stealing the ball from a defender and sending a close-range shot into the net in the 30th minute. He scored again in the 37th after picking up a loose ball inside the area. Olmo's third goal since joining Barcelona this season came from a tight angle in the 47th, and Pedri sealed the easy victory with a goal from inside the area in the 64th. Olmo, who had to be replaced in the second half because of a right leg injury, became the first player to score in his first three league games for Barcelona since Cesc Fabregas in 2011. Only Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in 2009, achieved the same feat this century. Cristhian Stuani scored Girona's lone goal in the 80th. The hosts were initially awarded a penalty kick for a handball inside the area just before halftime, with Barcelona leading 2-0, but the call was reversed by video review. Barcelona played with 10 men from the 87th after Ferran Torres was sent off for a hard foul on an opponent. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski played his 100th match with Barcelona. Girona, a surprise third-place finisher last season, won both league games against Barcelona last season. Newly signed Argentina forward A\u0301lvarez and England midfielder Gallagher scored their first goals for Atletico Madrid in the team's 3-0 win over last-place Valencia. A\u0301lvarez sealed the home victory in stoppage time after Gallagher had opened the scoring in the 39th and Griezmann had doubled the lead in the 54th. \u201cI didn't feel like I was under pressure to score,\u201d A\u0301lvarez said. \u201cI was ready for when the opportunity appeared.\u201d It was the second consecutive win for Atletico, and third in five league matches. Diego Simeone's team drew its other two games. Valencia has opened its season with four losses and a draw \u2014 1-1 against Villarreal in the previous round. Earlier Sunday, 10-man Athletic Bilbao won 3-2 at Las Palmas, which hasn't won in 19 straight league games going back to last season. It was the second win for Athletic this season. Celta Vigo beat Valladolid 3-1 at home for its first win after two consecutive losses. It was the fourth straight game without a win for Valladolid after it opened with a victory at Espanyol. It lost three of its next four games. Published - September 16, 2024 11:56 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit soccer",

            "content": "Two young women riding a scooter were killed after a speeding BMW car hit the two-wheeler in Indore, police said on Sunday (September 15, 2024). The car driver fled the scene with the vehicle after the accident occurred on late Saturday night. Police have registered a case against the car owner and the driver, and launched a search. The incident occurred in the Khajrana area when Lakshmi Tomar and Diksha Jadon were returning on a scooter after attending the famous Khajrana Ganesh temple fair. \"According to eyewitnesses, a BMW car rammed into the scooter. Due to the impact, both women were thrown onto the road, sustaining critical injuries. They were rushed to a nearby hospital where they succumbed to their injuries,\" said Khajrana police station in-charge Manoj Singh Sendhav. Lakshmi Tomar was the only earning member since her father died last year, her family members said. Originally from Shivpuri, Tomar was supporting her family by working in Indore, they said.

The Railway Ministry emphasised that although the term 'metro' typically refers to an urban transport system, the Vande Metro has been designed with state-of-the-art technology and advanced features to serve a wider range of travel needs. The Vande Metro marks a major advancement in India\u2019s rail transport infrastructure, combining modern amenities with a functional design to elevate the passenger experience.

            "content": "The suspect, Routh was apprehended following a \"be on the lookout\" alert issued by the FBI, Secret Service, and Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Trump Assassination Attempt: This was the second apparent assassination attempt on US former President Donald Trump within two months, the first one at the election rally in Pennsylvania and the second in Florida Golf Club on Sunday afternoon. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was on a golf course when the U.S. Secret Service detected an unusual presence nearby. The FBI has described the incident as an \"attempted assassination.\" 10 Key Things To Know About Trump\u2019s Assassination Attempt The law enforcement officials have arrested a 58-year-old suspect identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. He was allegedly seen behind the bushes, merely 400 to 500 yards away from Trump. When the Secret Service official shot in the direction, he dropped the weapon a high-powered AK-47 style rifle and fled the scene. Routh entered a black-coloured SUV and drove off only to be arrested later in a neighbouring county. According to the police, the suspect had two black bagpacks hanging on the fence and a GoPro camera. Martin County Sheriff William Snyder reported that the man, after being apprehended, remained remarkably \u2018calm\u2019 and showed minimal emotion. \u201cHe never inquired, \u2018What is this about?\u2019 Despite the presence of law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, and considerable activity, he did not question the situation,\u201d Snyder stated. In 2002, Routh was found guilty of having a weapon of mass destruction, according to online records from the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction. The records don't explain the case further, but a 2002 News & Record article mentions a man with the same name who was arrested after a three-hour standoff with police. Undeterred by the two consecutive near miss, Donald Trump said, \u201cThere were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL\u201d. \u201cNothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER,\" he informed his supporters via email and then returned to his residence at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach. Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the incident. The White House stated they were \u201crelieved\u201d to learn that Trump is safe. Harris, who is running against Trump in the presidential polls, commented in a statement that \"violence has no place in America.\" The suspect was apprehended following a \"be on the lookout\" alert issued by the FBI, Secret Service, and Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Sheriff William Snyder reported that his deputies \u201cimmediately flooded\u201d northbound I-95, covering every exit from the Palm Beach County line to the south and the St. Lucie County line to the north. \u201cOne of my road patrol units saw the vehicle, matched the tag, and we set up on the vehicle,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cWe pinched in on the car, got it safely stopped, and took the driver into custody.\u201d On July 13, Donald Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, with a bullet grazing his ear. Eight days later, President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, clearing the path for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee. Since the assassination attempt in July, Donald Trump\u2019s security measures have been significantly increased. When he is at Trump Tower in New York, dump trucks are strategically parked to form a barrier outside the building. At outdoor rallies, he now addresses the crowd from behind bulletproof glass.

            "content": "During his India visit, Ed Sheeran also met superstar Shah Rukh Khan and actor Ayushmann Khurrana. The pictures and videos from both meetings went viral in no time. Collaboration of Ed Sheeran with Indian artists is on the rise. After teaming up with Diljit Dosanjh in Mumbai earlier this year for a concert, the 'Perfect' hitmaker recently joined Arijit Singh at a show in London. On Monday, Arijit took to Instagram and expressed gratitude to Ed Sheeran for adding his \"perfect\" touch to his show, which was held on September 15. \"#london , thank you for showing up in such a magnificent way last night. Love and Gratitude #arijitsinghlive Thank you @teddysphotos for the #perfect moment (red heart emoji),\" he captioned the post, adding a few pictures from the show. In March 2024, Ed came to India and performed in Mumbai for the final leg of his +-=/x Tour (Mathematics), as part of his Asia and Europe Tour, 2024. During his India visit, Ed Sheeran also met superstar Shah Rukh Khan and actor Ayushmann Khurrana. The pictures and videos from both meetings went viral in no time. While SRK taught him his iconic signature pose, Ayushmann made him taste his mother's homemade cooked pinnis (Punjabi dessert). Talking about his meeting with Ed Sheeran, Ayuhsmann said, \"I have admired Ed Sheeran as an artist for years now. As a fellow musician, I have always wanted to connect with him and discuss how his mind works. I surprised him with my mother's homemade Pinni! This is how we have always welcomed anyone at our home. He is at our home and we need to tell him how much we love him and his music too. So, I hope this gift will be a memorable one!\" He also appeared on Kapil Sharma's talk show and Indian show 'Breakfast with Champions' alongside cricketer Rohit Sharma and host Gaurav Kapoor.",

            "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo will miss Al Nassr's AFC Champions League opener against Al Shorta. Al Nassr confirmed his absence, scroll down to know the reason. Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the world\u2019s most iconic footballers, will not be part of Al Nassr\u2019s opening match of the 2024-25 AFC Champions League against Iraqi side Al Shorta. The Portuguese star, who has been a key figure for the Saudi Arabian club, is set to miss the highly anticipated fixture due to a viral infection. This marks a significant setback for Al Nassr as they kickstart their campaign in the prestigious continental tournament. Ronaldo Ruled Out Due To Illness Al Nassr confirmed Ronaldo's absence on Sunday, September 15, through an official statement. The club revealed that their captain was diagnosed with a viral infection, preventing him from traveling with the team to Iraq. According to the team's medical advice, Ronaldo has been instructed to rest and recover at home. \"Al Nassr captain Cristiano Ronaldo was not feeling well today and was diagnosed with a viral infection. The team's doctor confirmed he needs to rest and stay at home. As a result, he will not be traveling with the team to Iraq today. We wish our captain a speedy recovery,\" the club announced via their social media channels. The absence of Ronaldo will surely be felt by Al Nassr, who have relied on the 38-year-old\u2019s experience and leadership since his high-profile move to Saudi Arabia. Despite this setback, Al Nassr will look to make a strong start to their AFC Champions League campaign under the guidance of coach Lui\u0301s Castro. Al Nassr\u2019s AFC Champions League 2024-25 Journey Al Nassr, alongside fellow Saudi clubs Al Hilal and Al Ahli, is part of the 2024-25 AFC Champions League Elite group stage. The competition has adopted a new format this season, similar to the Swiss system used in the UEFA Champions League, where each team plays eight matches \u2013 four at home and four away. Al Nassr\u2019s first challenge in the group stage will be an away fixture against Al Shorta on Monday, September 16. Following this, they will return to host Qatar\u2019s Al-Rayyan before traveling to Iran to face Esteghlal. Other key fixtures include a home clash with UAE\u2019s Al Ain, an away trip to Qatar to play Al Gharafa, and a final group match against Persepolis in Iran on February 17, 2025. This season\u2019s AFC Champions League is crucial for Al Nassr, with Ronaldo\u2019s presence expected to bolster their chances of making a deep run in the tournament. However, fans will have to wait a little longer for the Portuguese legend to make his debut in the 2024-25 competition, as he is expected to return to full fitness in the coming weeks. Road Ahead for Ronaldo and Al Nassr While Ronaldo\u2019s absence will be a blow for the team in their opening match, Al Nassr still boasts a formidable squad capable of competing at the highest level. The team will now turn to other stars such as Anderson Talisca and Sadio Mane\u0301 to lead the attack against Al Shorta. Ronaldo is expected to return to the pitch soon, with fans eager to see him in action as Al Nassr navigates the challenging group stage fixtures ahead. With the club aiming to make a significant impact on the continental stage, Ronaldo\u2019s eventual return will provide a much-needed boost as they chase AFC Champions League glory. For now, Al Nassr will be hoping to secure a positive result in Iraq and get their campaign off to a strong start, even without their talismanic captain.",

            "content": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, and probably a good friend of former US President Donald Trump, dropped an insensitive comment on the social media platform after the Republican candidate faced a second assassination attempt on Sunday. Trump was the target of what the FBI said \"appears to be an attempted assassination\" at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on September 15, just nine weeks after the Republican presidential nominee survived another attempt on his life. The former president said he was safe and well, and authorities held a man in custody. However, the business tycoon, Musk, on X, wondered, \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala\". The insensitive post came in response to a query from an X user with the handle @cb_doge, who asked why the former President was being targeted. CNN, Fox News and The New York Times identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. The FBI declined to comment and Reuters could not independently verify his identity. Reuters found profiles on X, Facebook, and LinkedIn for a Ryan Routh, and public access to the Facebook and X profiles was removed hours after the shooting. The three accounts bearing Routh's name suggest he was an avid supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia. On April 21, Routh directed an X message to Elon Musk, in which he wrote: \"I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putins Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please.\" The New York Times reported it had interviewed Routh in 2023 for an article about Americans who were volunteering to help the Ukraine war effort. Routh told the Times he'd traveled to Ukraine and spent several months there in 2022 and was trying to recruit Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. On X in 2020, Routh expressed support for Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and mocked Biden as \"sleepy Joe.\" Earlier this year, Routh tagged Biden in a post on X: \"@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.\" The suspected gunman's son, Adam, reached by Reuters at the hardware store where he works in Hawaii, said he had not yet heard of the newest Trump assassination attempt and had \"no information,\" adding it was not something he believed his father would do. Later, the reporter called back to the store and a colleague said Adam had gone home because of an emergency. Another son of Routh's, Oran, told CNN in a statement that \"I don't have any comment beyond a character profile of him as a loving and caring father ... I don't know what's happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion.\" (With inputs from agencies)",

            "content": "Kolkata Doctor Rape-Murder Case: The initial suspicion arose from nine calls made between Ghosh and Mondal that morning, details of which were obtained from their mobile phone records. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is set to conduct a joint interrogation of Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of R.G. Kar Medical College & Hospital, and Abhijit Mondal, the ex-station house officer of Tala Police Station, to probe into their suspicious activities on the morning of August 9. This was the day when the remains of a junior doctor, who was a victim of a brutal rape and murder, were found on the hospital grounds. The primary cause for suspicion arises from nine phone calls exchanged between Ghosh and Mondal that morning, details of which have been retrieved from their mobile phone call records. The CBI counsel informed a special court in Kolkata about these calls on Sunday. Investigators believe that by questioning Ghosh and Mondal together, they can uncover the nature of the information shared during these calls. Another concern is why Mondal's team, the first responders to the crime scene, and Ghosh permitted numerous individuals to leave the area, potentially compromising the integrity of the evidence. Both were arrested by the CBI on Saturday night for allegedly obstructing the initial investigation and tampering with evidence. Additionally, questions have been raised as to why Ghosh did not file an initial rape complaint and why Mondal did not enforce this procedure, despite clear signs of the heinous crime on the victim's body. Following their arrest, a special court granted the CBI a three-day custody of both individuals on Sunday. A pivotal Supreme Court hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, where the CBI is expected to present its second progress report on the case. Prominent Supreme Court advocate and activist Indira Jaising is set to participate in the proceedings.",

            "content": "Elon Musk Asks 'Why No Assassination Attempts On Biden, Harris' After Trump Suvives Another Attack. Reacting to the alleged assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump, tech billionaire Elon Musk made a controversial statement questioning why \"no assassination attempts were being made on US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\" On Sunday, Trump faced his second assassination attempt when gunshots were fired outside a golf course in Florida where he was playing. The FBI confirmed it was an attempted assassination, but both Trump\u2019s campaign and law enforcement reported that he was safe and unharmed. In response to an X user\u2019s question about why people might want to kill Trump, Musk tweeted: \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.\" As a Trump supporter, Musk often posts in his favor. The Secret Service confirmed that its agents \"opened fire on a gunman\" near the golf course and recovered an \"AK-47 style rifle\" along with a video camera. Authorities still haven\u2019t confirmed whether the gunman, identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, fired at Trump, but Secret Service agents did shoot at Routh, who was hiding in the bushes at the golf course. Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., mentioned that authorities also found an AK-47 rifle in the bushes, extremely close to where Trump was leaving. \"Again folks! SHOTS FIRED at Trump Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. An AK-47 was discovered in the bushes, per local law enforcement,\" Trump Jr. posted on X. This assassination attempt comes just two months after Trump was shot at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where he sustained a minor injury to his right ear. The attacker was immediately shot dead by security personnel. The White House issued a statement saying both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had been briefed about the incident. \"There is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement.",

            "content": "Tens of millions of people in Shanghai and across China's densely populated east coast hunkered indoors Monday (September 16, 2024) as the strongest storm to hit since 1949 swept in, downing trees and disrupting transport across the region. Typhoon Bebinca landed early Monday morning in the city's eastern coastal area, with wind speeds of up to 151 kilometres per hour (94 miles per hour), state media said. It is the strongest storm to hit Shanghai since Typhoon Gloria in 1949, state broadcaster CCTV said shortly after Bebinca made landfall. Many businesses were already closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival public holiday, and the city's 25 million residents have been advised to avoid leaving their homes. Shanghai's flood control headquarters told CCTV they had already received dozens of reports of incidents related to the typhoon \u2014 mostly fallen trees and billboards. An uprooted tree completely blocked one road in the city centre, an AFP reporter saw. Ferocious winds Xiong Zhuowu, a doctor and resident of the northern Baoshan district, posted a video of a real estate agent's sign being ripped away onto a roof in his compound. \"I feel quite nervous today, I'm constantly checking what the situation is out the window,\" Xiong told AFP . \"The property management found some trees with loose roots downstairs and immediately called me to move my car to prevent the tree hitting it if it fell.\" A government livefeed from Baoshan showed ferocious winds ripping through a line of trees on the riverbank. Despite the violent downpours and sudden gusts of wind, some were still braving the weather to go about errands. Resident Wu Yun said she had ventured outside because she had to sort something out at her sales job. \"I think it's okay, because I also saw a lot of typhoons in the south, so I think Shanghai is okay (compared to them),\" she told AFP as she struggled to open her umbrella against the wind. Branches and fallen bikes littered the road in the city's former French Concession, as delivery workers and clean-up crews persevered against the driving rain.

Highways were closed at 1 a.m. local time, and a 40-kilometre (25-mile) per-hour speed limit is in place on roads inside the city. At rush hour, live video feeds showed Shanghai's normally jammed roads almost empty of traffic, and its famed skyline obscured by thick fog. Nine thousand residents have been evacuated from Chongming District, an island at the mouth of the Yangtze River, authorities said. CCTV broadcast footage of a reporter by the coast in neighbouring Zhejiang province, where waves pounded the craggy coastline under leaden skies. \"If I step out into [the storm], I can barely speak,\" the reporter said. \"You can see that the surface of the sea is just wave after wave, each higher than the last.\" Another typhoon, Yagi, killed at least four people and injured 95 when it passed through China's southern Hainan island this month, according to national weather authorities. Bebinca has also passed through Japan and the central and southern Philippines, where falling trees killed six people. CCTV said Bebinca was expected to move northwest, causing heavy rain and high winds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are driving climate change and making extreme weather more frequent and intense.

            "content": "A day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's resignation announcement, Delhi Minister and AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday said despite whatever the Bharatiya Janata Party has done in 2 years, the chief minister still has faith in his people and his honesty. He went on to add that It has never happened in history that a sitting Chief Minister, after coming out of jail, is himself announcing that if you consider him honest, then vote for him. \"This will be the first election in the country, in which a Chief Minister is saying that this election will be fought in the name of honesty and that too, when the central government of the country, along with all the agencies, be it ED, CBI, Income Tax, all the agencies, are after the Chief Minister and no effort has been left to defame him,\" he said. Addressing a press conference, Bhardwaj said that the people of Delhi are so eager that the elections should be held and they will vote and make Arvind Kejriwal the Chief Minister again. On Sunday, Saurabh Bharadwaj addressed a press conference and said Kejriwal might be the only CM in the world to have resigned while asking people to vote for him only if he is honest. \"In the whole world, he might be the only CM who has asked people to vote for him only if he is honest, otherwise not to vote for him, that too after resigning from his post. That person is taking such a big risk to his whole career,\" he said. AAP leader Atishi called Sunday a 'historic day' in India's politics and said in this country's political history, the netas of political parties are seen with suspicion always, that they might have done corruption. But there is not one neta in the country's history who has asked for votes by telling people to only vote for him if he is honest, otherwise not to vote for him. To understand the announcement of CM Arvind Kejriwal, we need to understand Arvind Kejriwal the person.",

            "content": "Incessant rain lashed Jharkhand with the Weather Department issuing an orange alert of heavy to very heavy rainfall for parts of the State on Monday (September 16, 2024.) The local MeT office predicted respite from the incessant rainfall, which has been lashing Jharkhand for the past two days, during the next 48 hours. \u201cDue to the downpour, mainly in Garhwa and Latehar districts, several culverts and diversions were washed away on Sunday (September 15, 2024). Besides, the rainfall coupled with strong wind also damaged standing paddy crops in many areas,\u201d farmers said. Meral in Garhwa district received the State's highest rainfall of 152.8 mm on Sunday (September 15, 2024), while Ranchi's Budmu area registered 112.2 mm rainfall and Daltonganj recorded over 110mm rainfall. \"Orange alert of heavy to very heavy rainfall has been issued for the northwest parts comprising districts of Garhwa, Palamu, Chatra, Latehar and others for today,\" said Abhishek Anand, in-charge of Ranchi Meteorological Centre. He urged the people, particularly those living in low-lying areas, of the northwest areas to be alert. Mr. Anand said the system was gradually moving towards the west and it is expected to cross Jharkhand in the next 24 hours. \"Widespread rainfall expected on Monday (September 16, 2024). There will be a sharp decline in rainfall on Tuesday (September 17, 2024). Light to moderate rainfall is expected in parts of Jharkhand on Tuesday,\" he said. Jharkhand has recorded 822.2 mm rainfall from June 1 to September 15 against the normal rainfall of 920.8mm rainfall, a deficit of 11%, during the period.

            "content": "Shootouts between hundreds of tribal warriors have left at least 30 people dead in Papua New Guinea's highlands, police said on Monday (September 16, 2024) as security forces were given emergency powers to quell the violence. Police said the unrest started in August when \"illegal miners\" inflicted life-threatening injuries on a landowner in the Porgera Valley, home to one of Papua New Guinea's largest gold deposits. Peace talks failed, and the situation spiralled into intense tribal fighting that saw 300 shots fired on Sunday (September 15, 2024) alone, according to police commander Joseph Tondop. Police said 30 men had been killed across the rival clans and hundreds of women and children displaced, with \"many\" homes burned to the ground. Two officials were also killed while waiting for a lift home after work, said Mr. Tondop. Police Commissioner David Manning said \"lethal force\" would be used to restore order in the hard-to-reach highlands region. \"Put simply, this means if you raise a weapon in a public place or to threaten another person, you will be shot,\" Mr. Manning said in a statement at the weekend. \"This deteriorating situation has been caused by illegal miners and illegal settlers who are victimising traditional landowners and using violence to terrorise local communities.\" Police said illegal miners from the Sakar clan had been squatting on land owned by their Piande rivals. Alcohol sales have been banned and an overnight curfew is in place, added Manning, who vowed to remove the artisanal miners from the valley. Tribal conflicts are a frequent occurrence in Papua New Guinea's highlands, but an influx of automatic weapons has made clashes deadlier. The latest burst of fighting had been turbocharged by the presence of more than \"100 high-powered weapons in the wrong hands\", police said. Security teams have been posted along the highway leading to the mine, using loudhailers to broadcast messages of peace. 'Stop the spiral' The Porgera gold mine once accounted for around 10% of Papua New Guinea's yearly export earnings. But recurrent flare-ups of tribal violence and a drawn out government takeover have slowed production in recent years. Gunfights between rival clans living near the mine killed at least 17 in 2022. And at least 26 people were killed, including 16 children, when three villages in East Sepik province were attacked earlier this year. Pope Francis urged Papua New Guinea to \"stop the spiral\" of violence during a visit earlier this month. \"It is my particular hope that tribal violence will come to an end,\" he said. \"It causes many victims, prevents people from living in peace and hinders development.\" Published - September 16, 2024 11:22 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Over 2,000 people buried in Papua New Guinea landslide Papua New Guinea's prime minister visits the site of a landslide estimated to have killed hundreds World / armed conflict / mining",

The doctors continued their sit-in outside Swasthya Bhawan, the headquarters of the Health department, for the eight day and the cease work for the 36th day and vowed to continue it till their demands - the removal of Kolkata Police Commissioner and senior state health officials are met. \"We will continue our cease work till our demands are met. The State government is not serious about resolving the crisis,\" an agitating junior medic said. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on Saturday made a surprise visit to the site where the doctors were protesting and assured them that their demands would be addressed, but the proposed meeting fell through, with the protesters claiming that they were asked to leave \"unceremoniously\" after waiting for three hours at the gates of the CM's residence. Another protesting doctor claimed they had agreed to attend the meeting without live-streaming or video recording as Ms. Banerjee requested, but after notifying Minister of State for Health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, of this decision, they were told to leave because it was too late. A few previous attempts at talks between the junior doctors and Banerjee had also failed due to disagreements over live streaming of the meetings and the number of attending representatives.. The body of the postgraduate woman doctor was recovered in the seminar hall of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been conducting the probe into the rape and murder of the woman medic, following a Calcutta High Court order.

            "content": "Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's sudden announcement has sparked widespread speculation about potential successors, including his wife Sunita, and ministers Atishi and Gopal Rai. AAP's senior leader Manish Sisodia is scheduled to meet with Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday. This meeting comes in the wake of Kejriwal's declaration that he will not occupy the chief minister's seat until he receives a \"certificate of honesty\" from the public. Kejriwal has stated that he will only assume the role of chief minister, with Sisodia as his deputy, when the public deems them to be honest. On Monday, a party official stated, \"Today's meeting between Kejriwal and Sisodia will be their first since the announcement. It's expected that they will discuss the succession for the chief minister's post.\" The meeting is set to take place at the chief minister's official residence in Civil Lines. Following his release from Tihar Jail on bail related to the excise policy graft case last Friday, Kejriwal announced plans to convene a meeting with AAP MLAs soon. He indicated that a fellow party member would succeed him as chief minister. This sudden announcement has sparked widespread speculation about potential successors, including his wife Sunita, and ministers Atishi and Gopal Rai.",

            "content": "Pitru Paksha is observed over a period of sixteen days when auspicious rituals such as Pind Daan, Shradh and Pitru Tarpan are performed. Pitru Paksha, also known as Shradh or Mahalaya Paksha, is a significant period in Hinduism dedicated to honoring and paying respects to one's ancestors or Pitrus. The roots of Pitru Paksha can be traced back to ancient Hindu scriptures, including the Garuda Purana and the Mahabharata. According to Hindu mythology, it is believed that during this time, the gateway to the afterlife is opened, allowing departed souls to temporarily return to the earthly realm. This is an extremely auspicious time of the year when the deceased people of the family are remembered. Pitru Paksha is observed over a period of sixteen days when auspicious rituals such as Pind Daan, Shradh and Pitru Tarpan are performed. Shradh Date 2024 According to Drik Panchang, this year, Pitru Paksha will start with Bhadrapada, Shukla Purnima on September 17, and will go on till October 2, Ashwina, Krishna Amavasya. Auspicious Time For Shradh Karma 2024 According to Drik Panchang, the auspicious time for shradh karma will be, Kutup Muhurta: 11:50 am to 12:39 pm Rohin Muhurta: 12:39 pm to 01:28 pm Pitru Paksha Significance Pitru Paksha holds immense significance in Hindu culture for several reasons: Ancestral Reverence: It is a time when Hindus express their gratitude and respect to their forefathers, acknowledging their role in shaping the family's lineage and seeking their blessings for prosperity and well-being. Karmic Cleansing: Hindus believe that performing Shradh rituals during Pitru Paksha can help alleviate the ancestral souls' suffering and cleanse any negative karmas that may be affecting the family's fortunes. Fulfillment of Duties: Observing Pitru Paksha rituals is considered a moral and religious duty (dharma) in Hinduism. It is believed that neglecting these rites can lead to discontent among the ancestors, which may, in turn, bring misfortunes to the living. Rituals of Shradh 2024 The Shradh rituals during Pitru Paksha are performed with great devotion and care. Here are some of the essential practices associated with this period: Pinda Daan : Pinda, or rice balls, are prepared and offered to the deceased ancestors. The number and size of pindas vary depending on the deceased's age and gender. Food Offerings : Elaborate meals are prepared and offered to the ancestors. This includes dishes like kheer, puri, vegetables, and sweets. The food is placed on a banana leaf or a plate and then offered to the Pitrus. Tithi Shraddha : On the specific day of the deceased ancestor's death anniversary (tithi), a more elaborate Shradh ceremony is performed with additional rituals and offerings. Donations : It is customary to give alms to the needy and make charitable donations during Pitru Paksha as a way of earning merit for the ancestors' souls. Feeding Brahmins: Offering meals to Brahmins and seeking their blessings is another common practice during this period. (This article is intended for your general information only.

            "content": "Shares of Bajaj Housing Finance more-than-doubled in their trading debut on Monday (September 16, 2024), giving the company a market capitalisation of 1.34 trillion Rupees ($16 billion) and making it most valuable listed home loan financier. The stock rose as much as 130% to 161 Rupees before paring some gains to trade at 125% higher. The stock was listed at 150 Rupees on the National Stock Exchange of India, compared with an offer price of 70 Rupees. The second-biggest home loan financier by Assets Under Management (AUM), Bajaj Housing Finance's $782 million IPO had attracted bids worth about $38.60 billion last week, making it the most sought-after public listing this year in a red-hot IPO market. Backed by the 100-year-old Bajaj group, the offering drew investors due to its pedigree, an ongoing IPO euphoria and booming demand for luxury homes, that is set to push home prices higher in the country. A rally in the Indian stock market has resulted in more than 200 companies raising more than $7 billion this year, more than double the amount raised during the same period last year, London Stock Exchange Group data showed.

            "content": "Backed by the two in-form stars in World Championship challenger D. Gukesh and Arjun Erigaise, the Indian men scored a 3-1 victory over Azerbaijan in the fifth round of the 45th Chess Olympiad here. It seems like Gukesh and Arjun can do nothing wrong in this Olympiad as they overpowered Aydin Sulemanli and Rauf Mamedov respectively with their white pieces in quick time. Praggnanandhaa played another draw on board two to only ensure an Indian victory while Vidit Gujrathi played out a draw with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in a marathon game to complete the triumph. After scoring the fifth victory on the trot, the Indian men maintained a clean slate on ten points and they were joined by Vietnam who continued with their impressive show and downed Poland 2.5-1.5. The other two teams that joined the leaders\u2019 pack were China and Hungary who scored identical 2.5-1.5 victories over Spain and Ukraine respectively. With six rounds still to come in the biggest chess event, Magnus Carlsen\u2019s Norway and Iran are the only two teams sharing the fifth spot on 9 points apiece. Norway defeated a talented Turkey team by a 3-1 margin while Iran made most of the opportunities to down Canada 3.5-0.5. In the women\u2019s section, Grandmaster D. Harika suffered a shock defeat to give Kazakhstan an early lead. Better for most of the game, Harika misplayed after many pundits believed her position to be winning against Bibisara Assaubayeva. On the fourth board Vantika Agarwal yet again played the anchor and won a clean game with white pieces against Alua Nurman while Xeniya Balabayeva split the point with Divya Deshmukh. With the scores tied at 2-2 it was Vaishali\u2019s turn to come up triumphs for the team and she outwitted Meruert Kamalidenova. Team India joined Armenia and Mongolia in the lead on ten points. Armenia halted the Chinese party for now handing them a 2.5-1.5 defeat while Mongolia proved superior to United States with a similar score. The three leaders have 10 points apiece and they are now followed by Georgia and Poland a half point behind. Gukesh scored his fourth victory in a row at the expense of Sulemanli. The World championship challenger got a huge middle game advantage with scattered black pieces and a weak king and made no mistakes in converting that in to a full point. Arjun is the only Indian who has played all five games thus far and the primary reason is his ability to complicate matters with either colour. Up against Mamedov, it was Sicilian Dragon structure wherein Arjun converted to a complicated endgame and then his precise calculation helped him carve out his fifth win as many games. For the records, Arjun is currently at 2888 ELO rating points in live ratings and just 12 short of attaining the magical 2800 mark \u2013 a summit captured by only Viswanathan Anand as an Indian. The women section has seen some serious bouts wherein the tables were turned in quick time. In the next round now, the eves will take on Armenia. Results round 5 open: India (10) beat Azerbaijan (8) 3-1 (D Gukesh beat Aydin Sulemanli; R Praggnanandhaa drew with Nijat Abasov; Arjun Erigaise beat Rauf Mamedov; Shakhriyar Mamedyarov drew with Vidit Gujrathi); Ukraine (8) lost to Hungary (10) 1.5-2.5; Vietnam (10) beat Poland (8) 2.5-1.5; Spain (8) lost to China (10) 1.5-2.5; Turkey (7) lost to Norway (9) 1-3; Iran (9) beat Canada (7) 3.5-0.5. Women: Kazakhstan (8) lost to India (10) 1.5-2.5 (Bibisara Asaubayeva beat D Harika; R Vaishali beat Meruert Kamalidenova; Xeniya Balabayeva drew with Divya Deshmukh; Vantika Agrawal beat Alua Nurman); China (8) lost to Armenia (10) 1.5-2.5; Mongolia (10) beat USA (8) 2.5-1.5; Uzbekistan (7) lost to Georgia (9)1.5-2.5; Poland (9) beat Turkey (7) 3-1.

In yet another such incident in the district's Tipri Mohan village, a 10-year-old boy was injured when a wolf attacked him in the early hours of Monday. The attack occurred at around 2:30 am while the boy was asleep on the rooftop of his house. The victim has been identified as Imran. ' As per the information, the animal reportedly attempted to drag Imran by his neck, leaving deep wounds on his throat. The child was rushed to the district hospital in Bahraich for urgent medical treatment. According to the villagers, footprints matching those of a wolf were found inside the house, adding to the belief that the predator responsible for the attack was indeed a wolf. Eyewitnesses and local residents described how the wolf climbed up the staircase from the fields, crossed over one rooftop, and then attacked the sleeping child on a charpoy (traditional Indian bed) on a neighbouring roof. The village is now on high alert, with many fearing for their safety after the recent spate of wildlife attacks. This is not the first such incident in Bahraich. The district has seen a series of wolf-related attacks in recent months, leading to heightened concern among the local population. Authorities have been alerted, and forest officials are expected to increase patrols and take necessary steps to track down the animal. Around 50 villages in the Bahraich district are under threat from a pack of man-eating wolves. In a recent development, the Forest Department team captured the fifth wolf of the pack on September 10. The fifth wolf was captured as part of the 'Operation Bhediya' campaign that has been ongoing in Bahraich's Mahasi tehsil to catch a pack of six wolves that have killed eight people and injured more than 20 since mid-July, officials said. This wolf was the fifth member of a pack of six wolves that have been terrorising the 50 villages of Mahsi Tehsil for the past one and a half months. The team is now on the hunt for a wolf named 'Alpha.' The Divisional Forest Officer Ajit Pratap Singh said that \"Operation Bhedia\" is underway in the district and wolves are changing their location which makes it difficult to capture them. In the Mahsi tehsil of the district, wolf attacks on humans have been happening since March, Singh said. The attacks increased from July 17 during the rainy season and seven people, including six children, died in the attacks and about 30 people were injured, he added.",

The British needed a 3-0 win against the Canadians in Manchester, but Dan Evans lost 6-0, 7-5 to Denis Shapovalov to end Britain's hopes in the opening match in front of a crowd of 15,700 at the AO Arena, the biggest for a Davis Cup tie on British soil, according to organizers. Felix Auger-Aliassime then defeated Jack Draper 7-6 (8), 7-5 to seal Canada's victory and first place in Group D. England won the final doubles match. Evans hinted this may have been his last Davis Cup appearance. \u201cI've probably had my fair share now. It could be and probably will be (the end),\u201d he said. \u201cI need to have a think. If I don't feel capable of playing, I won't come back.\u201d Canada and Argentina advanced from Group D. Finland was the other team eliminated. Four groups have been playing in four cities to qualify for the eight-team Finals in Malaga, Spain, in November. The top two in each four-team group advance. In Valencia, Spain defeated Australia 2-1 to win Group B with both having already qualified. France and the Czech Republic were eliminated. In Bologna, the Netherlands won the closing doubles match to clinch its spot in the Finals despite a 2-1 loss to Italy in Group A. The Dutch needed a single win to advance but had lost the first two matches. The decisive win came with Wesley Koolhof and Botic van de Zandschulp defeating Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori 7-6 (6), 7-5. Brazil would have advanced had the Netherlands lost 3-0 to group-winner Italy. Belgium had already been eliminated. In Group C, Chile beat Slovakia in a match in Zhuhai, China between already eliminated nations. The United States and Germany had advanced from the group. Djokovic led Serbia to a 3-1 win over Greece in a World Group 1 tie in Belgrade. The Olympic champion partnered Hamad Medjedovic to a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 win over Aristotelis Thanos and Petros Tsitsipas. Djokovic beat Ioannis Xilas 6-0, 6-1 in the singles on Saturday (September 14, 2024). Former world No. 4 and two-time Davis Cup champion Tomas Berdych will take over the captaincy from Jaroslav Navratil for the Czech Republic. Navratil captained the Czechs for nearly two decades, including when it won the 2012 and 2013 titles with Berdych as a player.

            "content": "Senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia will meet Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday (September 16, 2024), a day after the party supremo announced to resign and not sit on the Chief Minister's chair till people give him a \"certificate of honesty\". The AAP national convener said that he would become Chief Minister and Manish Sisodia his deputy \"only when people say we are honest\". A party functionary on Monday said, \"Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Sisodia will be meeting today. This will be the first meeting after the decision by them. The meeting is also likely to see a discussion over the next Chief Minister.\" The meeting is slated to be held at the Chief Minister's official residence in the Civil Lines area. Mr. Kejriwal, who was released on bail from the Tihar Jail in the excise policy graft case on Friday, has said that he would hold a meeting of the AAP MLAs in a couple of days and one of his party colleagues would take over as the chief minister. His unexpected announcement kicked up a strong buzz over the names of his wife Sunita and his ministers Atishi and Gopal Rai as his possible replacement.

            "description": "Social media accounts bearing Ryan Routh's name suggest he was an avid supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia.",
            "content": "A gunman attempted to assassinate former U.S. president Donald Trump on Sunday (September 15, 2024) at Mr. Trump's golf course in Palm Beach, Florida, authorities said. Several news organisations identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. The FBI declined to comment. Here is what we know so far about the suspected gunman: Gun barrel in bushes The Secret Service said its agents were accompanying Mr. Trump on the golf course, when one who was securing holes ahead of the Republican presidential candidate spotted a gun barrel in some bushes near the property line. Multiple agents engaged the gunman and fired at least four rounds at him. The gunman then dropped his AK-47 style rifle, two backpacks, a Go Pro camera and other items and fled in a black Nissan car. Palm Beach County sheriff Ric Bradshaw said a witness managed to take a photo of the suspected gunman's car and license plate and gave it to authorities. Shortly after, sheriff's deputies in neighboring Martin County stopped the suspect on Interstate 95 and took him into custody. Posts on Ukraine, democracy Reuters found profiles on X, Facebook, and LinkedIn for a Ryan Routh, and public access to the Facebook and X profiles was removed hours after the shooting. The three accounts bearing Routh's name suggest he was an avid supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia. On April 21, Routh directed an X message to Elon Musk, in which he wrote: \"I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putins Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please.\" The New York Times reported it had interviewed Routh in 2023 for an article about Americans who were volunteering to help the Ukraine war effort. Routh told the Times he had travelled to Ukraine and spent several months there in 2022 and was trying to recruit Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. On X in 2020, Routh expressed support for Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and mocked Mr. Biden as \"sleepy Joe.\" Earlier this year, Routh tagged Mr. Biden in a post on X: \"@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA... make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.\" The suspected gunman's son, Adam, reached by Reuters at the hardware store where he works in Hawaii, said he had not yet heard of the newest Trump assassination attempt and had \"no information,\" adding it was not something he believed his father would do. Later, the reporter called back to the store and a colleague said Adam had gone home because of an emergency. Another son of Routh's, Oran, told CNN in a statement that \"I don't have any comment beyond a character profile of him as a loving and caring father... I don't know what's happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion.\" Published - September 16, 2024 10:33 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit USA",

            "content": "The 2024 Emmy Awards, held on September 15 at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, turned out to be quite the spectacle of television\u2019s brightest and boldest. The return to the traditional fall schedule, after a strike-induced delay, gave delivered some much-needed freshness of perspective on the medium\u2019s current trends and successes.The ceremony, hosted by father-son duo Eugene and Dan Levy offered up a snapshot of television\u2019s current landscape over the last year, defined by both remarkable firsts and unexpected shifts in fortune. Leading the charge was FX\u2019s Japanese tidal wave, Shogun . For the first time in Emmy history, the show broke the mold by becoming the first majority non-English language series to snag the Best Drama Series award. It didn\u2019t stop there, amassing an unprecedented 18 Emmys in total.

Meanwhile, Japanese film veteran, Hiroyuki Sanada, made a historic mark as the first Japanese actor to win Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, while Anna Sawai became the first actress of Asian descent to capture the Best Actress trophy. Director Frederick E. O. Toye rounded out the night\u2019s wins, bagging the Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for the episode, \u201cCrimson Sky\u2019. Comedy took an unexpected turn with Hacks stepping into the spotlight. The HBO Max series, previously seen as a contender but not a frontrunner, pulled off a major upset. It managed to wrestle the Best Comedy Series award from the grasp of The Bear . Carl Clemons-Hopkins, Mark Indelicato, Rose Abdoo, Jean Smart, Hannah Einbinder, Paul W.

Downs, and Jen Statsky \u2014 were recognized for their sharp work on the episode \u201cBulletproof.\u201d The victory was a real David vs. Goliath moment, as The Bear had been expected to dominate. Despite this, The Bear still had a night to remember, clinching 11 Emmys including back-to-back wins for Jeremy Allen White and Ebon Moss-Bachrach, a first time win for Liza Colon-Zayas and the award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for Christopher Storer. This marks a record for the most Emmys won by a comedy series in a single year, surpassing its own previous record of 10 wins. Baby Reindeer concluded its run , sweeping the Limited/Anthology Series categories with four Emmys, including Best Limited Series. Richard Gadd and Jessica Gunning earned awards for their lead and supporting roles, respectively, while Gadd\u2019s writing was also recognised.

Frech became the fourth Polish woman to win a singles title this century joining Magda Linette, Agnieszka Radwanska and current world No.1 Iga Swiatek. Frech made her first WTA singles final last July in Prague but the Guadalajara Open was her maiden WTA 500 final and first on hard courts. Gadecki arrived in Mexico with just two career wins over top-100 players but she recorded four this week, including a second-round win over world No. 11 Danielle Collins. The 22-year-old Australian, who is ranked 152nd, narrowly failed to become the first qualifier to win a singles title at WTA 500 level since 2021, when Liudmila Samsonova won at Berlin.
