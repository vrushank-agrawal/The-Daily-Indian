The BJP will throw more weight behind the candidates of NCP and Shiv Sena,\" he said.Asked about the accident involving the Audi car belonging to his son in Nagpur, he said the matter was under investigation.\"Let there be an investigation in the case. Be it my son or anybody's son, whatever rules are there, they should be applied. It is a matter for the police to investigate, I am thankful to God that no one was injured,\" he said. Asked about a social media post by NCP (SP) leader Rohit Pawar where he cited a survey predicting 65 to 70 seats",

Come July a number of them are higher than what they were on the day of the election results. Come August, they are not performing as well as they were in the first five months of 2024, The result, a narrative on the street starts that they are overpriced and to add icing on the cake, some fund managers make statements about not owning them or that they have booked profit in them. The question to be asked from these so-called alpha fund managers, some of them who run PMS, is whether they bought these defence stocks 5 years back when no one was looking at them or they bought just as they became momentum stocks. Sometimes narratives get formed on the street, which may lead to wrong decisions if one does not question them.",
