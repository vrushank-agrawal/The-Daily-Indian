            "description": "Sharma, who was in the top-15 after the first two days, ended with a total of 4-over 288",
            "content": "Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma had a choppy back nine leading to a round of 1-over 72 as he finished a disappointing T-42nd at the Amgen Irish Open at Royal County Down. Sharma, who was in the top-15 after the first two days, ended with a total of 4-over 288. He parred through the front nine and two more holes before finding his first birdie on the 12th. He bogeyed 13th and the 15th but birdied 16th only to drop a shot on 17th and close with a par. Meanwhile, Rasmus H\u00f8jgaard holed out twice and produced a stunning finish with four birdies in last five holes as he beat local favourite Rory McIlroy. McIlroy looked on course to claim his first professional win on home soil when he led by two shots with four holes to play at a venue just an hour from where he grew up. However, H\u00f8jgaard's superb closing 65 saw him claim his fifth DP World Tour title and move to second in the Race to Dubai Rankings and to the top of the European Ryder Cup standings. McIlroy had taken a one-shot lead into the final round and made the ideal start with birdies on the first and second. With playing partner Matteo Manassero then dropping shots on the third and fourth, McIlroy briefly enjoyed a four-shot lead before making a bogey on the seventh after failing to get up and down from left of the green. He then missed from inside ten feet for birdie on both the eighth and the ninth as H\u00f8jgaard kickstarted his challenge with an outrageous chip-in for birdie on the tenth. A birdie on the 11th edged McIlroy two in front again, but that advantage was wiped out as H\u00f8jgaard birdied the 16th and McIlroy bogeyed the 15th. H\u00f8jgaard then dramatically holed out from a greenside bunker on the 17th and, although McIlroy drew level with a birdie on the 16th, he charged his birdie putt on the 17th past the hole and missed the return. H\u00f8jgaard's third birdie in a row on the 18th meant McIlroy needed to make an eagle on the same hole to force a play-off and a towering approach from 191 yards gave him a chance from 15 feet, only for the eagle putt to slide just wide. \u201cI was nervous. I was shaking out there the last few holes. I obviously knew that Rory was going to be there because he's got the whole support on his back there. It was nerve-wracking going down the last few holes knowing that he was right behind me,\u201d H\u00f8jgaard said.

            "content": "Champions Inter Milan were knocked off the Serie A summit on Sunday (September 15, 2024) after they came from behind to play out a surprise 1-1 draw at lowly Monza. Monza took the lead in the 81st minute through substitute forward Dany Mota, who headed the ball into the top corner before Denzel Dumfries levelled for Inter in the 88th from close range. Inter, who drew at Genoa in their season opener followed by wins against Lecce and Atalanta, dropped to second in the table with eight points after four games. They are one point behind Napoli, who beat Cagliari 4-0 earlier on Sunday. Simone Inzaghi's men next travel to Manchester City on Wednesday to kick off their Champions League campaign before they host AC Milan in the league next Sunday. There were no early signs of trouble for Inter, who were patiently building play from the back, controlling the pace of the game. Lautaro Martinez should have put them in front inside the opening 10 minutes, when he received a perfect cross from Federico Dimarco. His header from the centre of the box, however, sailed slightly above bar before Dimarco and Davide Frattesi also had their chances early on. But Monza's calm defence did not leave the visitors much space and they went on to earn a shock lead as Mota nodded home from a neat lofted cross from Armando Izzo. Inter intensified their efforts and defender Dumfries equalised with first touch two minutes from time, tapping a low cross from Carlos Augusto, but lacked time to find a winner. Monza, who drew with Empoli and Fiorentina either side of their home loss to Genoa, are 15th with three points. They still await first win under new coach and former Milan defender Alessandro Nesta as they are now winless in their last 13 Serie A games, the longest ongoing run of any side currently in the top flight.

            "content": "Two prominent journalists of Bangladesh , known for their work in both print and TV, were arrested by the police on Monday (September 16, 2024) morning in Mymensingh. Editor of Bhorer Kagoj Shyamal Datta, and Muzammil Babu, Managing Director and Chief Editor of Ekattor TV , one of the biggest TV channels in Dhaka, were surrounded by a mob who took them to a police station in the district, sources have informed. They were subsequently taken to Dhaka. Mr. Datta is known for extensive coverage of India-Bangladesh relations and has often courted controversy for his revealing reports and analyses. Similarly, the Muzamil Babu-led Ekattor TV is known for its coverage of the South Asian scenario. Both journalists have travelled extensively across the world and had visited India on June 21 during the state visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Both are known to have extensive contacts regarding Bangladesh\u2019s political scenario. Dozens of journalists have had cases lodged against them in Bangladesh in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the arrests of Mr. Datta and Mr. Babu are believed to be related to some of the cases that pertain to the period of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. A source in Bangladesh pointed out that genocide cases have been lodged against Ms. Hasina for her role in the killing of protesters during July-August 2024 and the two senior media professionals have been arrested for remarks that they might have made regarding the protest.

However, Monday\u2019s arrest in Dhobaura of Mymensing bordering Meghalaya triggered speculation that both were planning to cross into India. Ekattor TV was earlier attacked by a mob on 5 August that had burnt down the studio and other facilities belonging to the channel. Subsequently, the channel revived itself and resumed its telecast.

            "description": "The Rajya Sabha under Jagdeep Dhankar\u2019s chairmanship is leading by example in translating the ideal of women-led development into a reality",
            "content": "T he phrase \u2018women-led development\u2019, which was recognised as one of the six focal points during India\u2019s presidency of the G20, has always been a cornerstone of the government\u2019s priorities and policies. Under a women-led development approach, women are not just beneficiaries of development, but also set the agenda for development. They are key participants in planning and decision-making. Explained: On political representation of women Measures in the House At a time when women are leading governance and development initiatives across the world, India\u2019s legislature, a pivotal organ of its democracy, cannot afford to be left behind. It is in this backdrop that the Vice President of India and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Jagdeep Dhankar, has introduced a slew of progressive measures in the proceedings of the House as well as in the Secretariat. Mr. Dhankar has always held the view that the role of women in Parliament is enormous. He has stated that women are the backbone of Parliament and the country\u2019s economic development. When the nation witnessed the historic passage of the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam (Women\u2019s Reservation Bill), 2023, Mr. Dhankar, in a historic move, reconstituted the panel of vice-chairpersons to include only women. He emphasised that this would \u201csend a powerful message to the world at large and it would symbolise that they held a \u2018commanding position\u2019 during this epochal moment of change\u201d. Mr. Dhankar also began the practice of nominating four women members, who constitute 50% of the panel of vice-chairpersons. As a result, S. Phangnon Konyak became the first woman Rajya Sabha member from Nagaland to preside over the House. Eminent athlete P.T. Usha also created history by becoming the first nominated MP in history to become the Vice Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha. Under India\u2019s presidency, the G20 New Delhi Leaders\u2019 Declaration underscored that investing in the empowerment of all women and girls has a multiplier effect in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. India is already working tirelessly towards goal 5.5 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which calls for \u201cwomen\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic, and public life.\u201d The Rajya Sabha Secretariat is expected to set the highest standards in this direction. Also Read: Women Ministers increase their presence in the Houses, but remain stagnant in Union Ministry Initiatives in the Secretariat With the aim of striking a gender balance at the Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Mr. Dhankar has started many new initiatives. For example, the sections related to House duty were conventionally considered a male domain because they involved late sittings. The Chairman felt the need to break such stereotypes and so, all the gazetted women officers of the Secretariat were trained to perform House-related duties. Today, the Table of the House is largely being \u2018womanned\u2019 by female officers. Accordingly, a duty roster is prepared and women officers are deputed on chamber duty. Moreover, an application-based system called \u2018Vahan\u2019 was introduced to address the problem of commutation during late sitting hours. Through this app, women officers can avail themselves of commutation facilities during odd hours. In addition, through a process of selection, some women officials of the Secretariat have been appointed as chamber attendants. This has created a favourable atmosphere even inside the House for women MPs. During various interactions with the officers of the Secretariat, Mr. Dhankar has unequivocally stated that women-led development is going to be the future road map of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat. The process has already begun. Women officers have been appointed in key positions and leading roles in the Rajya Sabha Secretariat. Today, responsibilities such as human resources, the legislative section, and the capacity-building division have been entrusted to women officers of the Secretariat. Besides, high skill-based work such as officiating in Parliamentary Standing Committees of the Rajya Sabha is being done by women at various levels. Even some senior positions in security service are being occupied by women officers. Top performing women officers are being recognised and rewarded all across the services. A woman officer of the Secretariat has been appointed as master trainer for iGOT-Karmayogi Bharat. The noteworthy aspect about introducing women-centric measures in the Secretariat is the spirit of congeniality. Gender sensitisation workshops and talks have been organised to create a healthy culture of gender parity. The Chairman, from time to time, has also impressed upon the need of synergising work with creativity and recreation. The celebration of women\u2019s day in the Secretariat is a case in point. Women\u2019s day programmes are conceptualised, organised and executed by women officers or employees. These events give them many opportunities to showcase their talents. In a vibrant democracy, it is healthy to have regular interactions between the legislature and academia. The buck should not just stop at the Secretariat. Therefore, Mr. Dhankar offered to invite five interns from Miranda House in Delhi for a 15-day course on parliamentary procedures. The Rajya Sabha under Mr. Dhankar\u2019s chairmanship is leading by example in translating the ideal of women-led development into a reality. This may pave the way for other legislatures in India to follow suit. Kusum Sudhir, Joint Secretary (Interpretation) Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Parliament of India.

After the meeting, Mamata Banerjee addressed the media and said that the talks yielded positive results. She said that Goyal is also ready to resign from his post. During the meeting, doctors also demanded to remove the Director of Medical Education (DME), DHS and the Health Secretary. CM Mamata accepted the demand and removed DME, DHS from their posts. She said that she talked to everyone separately and she believes that the doctors should return to work. Notably, after many invitations by the government, the medics decided to meet CM Mamata today. The junior medics of RG Kar Hospital, who left work demanding justice for the Kolkata rape-murder case victim put conditions for the meeting. Their condition of noting minutes of the meeting was accepted by the Chief Secretary, following which, the doctors met CM Banerjee.

Manipur has been affected by ethnic violence between the tribal Kuki-Zo and the Meitei people since May 3, 2023. Due to blockade of national highways and other arterial roads by members of both the communities, the trucks and vehicles are often stopped, leading to shortage of essentials in both the hills and the valley.

            "content": "The Indian cricket team is gearing up for their first Test match against Bangladesh at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai from September 19 onwards. The Men in Blue will look to make the most of the two-match series against the Bangla Tigers, who themselves are coming off a series sweep over Pakistan recently. Ahead of the opening Test, the Indian players are training hard at Chepauk to get in the groove for the real action. The same happened in the third training session on Monday when all the 16 players - including Sarfaraz Khan, who joined the team after Duleep Trophy's second round - took part in an intense session. During the session, rising star Yashasvi Jaiswal was seen struggling big against the iconic pacer . The speedster cleaned up the Southpaw several times, sending his stumps flying for fun. As per reports, Jaiswal was struggling against India's senior pro and was not sure of his off-stump. Apart from Bumrah, he was troubled by the net bowlers Simarjeet Singh, Gurnoor Brar and Gurjanpreet Singh in the training session. Batting maestro , captain , and Sarfaraz Khan also batted. A fielding session also took place and India's fielding coach, T Dilip, opened up on it. \"Today, the whole session idea was to get everyone together for a team drill with two segments to it. First is competition taking humidity into account, we made sure that volume is less but intensity is more,\" Dilip told bcci.tv after the session. \"We split teams into two groups and made some competition in catching and the team that made less number of errors won. It was Virat's team that won today. We split two batches -- bowlers and all-rounders split into two stations, where outfield and in-field catching was taken care of along with attacking ground fielding. \"The second group was standard batting group for slip cordon catching and also short-leg, silly point with some reflex catching. Overall, I feel it was a fantastic session, considering hot overhead sun and getting used to it but one great part about this team is throughout all stations, the intensity was top notch in this weather,\" Dilip explained.",

            "content": "The CPI-affiliated AITUC has urged the government to urgently implement the long-pending plea for a welfare board for unorganised labourers. The AITUC general council, which held a meeting presided by Dinesh Ponnaiah, AITUC president, passed a resolution asking the government to not delay any further the establishment of a welfare board that would extend a social security net for more than 40,000 workers in the unorganised sector across diverse vocations. Pointing out that the government, which had announced the constitution of a welfare board following a long workers\u2019 struggle, the proposal was yet to take off. The government should immediately set up a welfare board and allocated adequate funds, the resolution said. Through another resolution, the AITUC reiterated its demand for a textile park that would aggregate defunct mills and generate jobs. It urged the Lt. Governor, K. Kailashnathan, who had recently visited the defunct AFT Mills and suggested putting the space to other use, to abandon the idea and instead take steps to revive the textile unit. The AITUC has also demanded that enterprises such as PASIC and PAPSCO immediately disburse salary arrears to workers. It also wanted the Pondicherry Municipality to conduct the election to the street vendors committee as the process had been postponed abruptly after the filing of nominations. AITUC general secretary K. Sethuselvam, AITUC honorary president V.S. Abishegam and others leaders participated.

A government source told The Hindu that Mr. Mohan was likely to reach Puducherry on Sunday evening. On the following day, he would hold a high level meeting to review progress of the Centre\u2019s flagship programmes and subjects pertaining to Union Territory administration. He is likely to leave Puducherry on Monday, the source said. Mr. Mohan took over as the Home Secretary in August. Prior to his appointment as Home Secretary, he was Secretary, Culture. Before moving to the Ministry of Culture, Mr. Mohan had a long stint in the Ministry of Home Affairs as Additional Secretary and Joint Secretary in-charge of the U.T. desk of the Ministry, said an official. \u201cHe is visiting U.T.s after taking charge as Home Secretary. Last week, he visited Andaman and reviewed implementation of schemes. Tentatively, the tour to Puducherry has been planned for Sunday and Monday. The schedule is yet to be fixed. As we come under the direct control of MHA, his visit will be of great significance,\u201d the source said. According to a ruling party member, the visit would be an occasion for the government to take up long pending administrative requirements. \u201cIn the recent times, we didn\u2019t have any visit by the Home Secretary to Puducherry to hold a review meeting. Since the officer is an old hand in the Ministry, he will be very aware of the issues and requirements of Puducherry. It is a good initiative on the part of Centre to depute the Home Secretary himself to assess the requirements of UT. We can discuss, sort out administrative issues and find ways to speed up implementation of infrastructure and welfare schemes,\u201d the member said.

The video shows a man being forced to strip and being chased on the road naked, even as he is being beaten up. The video was reportedly shot a few days ago. Following the video going viral on social media, the police have now begun a probe. According to the police, the accused identified as Pawan Gowda alias Kadubu, is a rowdy sheeter at Rajagopal Nagar police station. The victim is his friend turned foe, who was assaulted reportedly over a trivial row, to teach him a lesson. The victim also has a criminal past and has hence not lodged a complaint, a senior police officer said. \u201cWe are on the lookout for both of them who are presently on the run \u201c the official added. The video was deliberately put on social media by the accused to create a fear psychosis among his rivals, as part of a well thought out strategy, the official said.

Addressing the workers at the fast venue on Anna Salai, party secretary A. Anbalagan said the government cannot shrug its responsibility by merely stating that the power tariff was decided by the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC). The government did not put pressure on JERC to defer the hike, he said. The frequent hike has created huge financial burden on the common man, he said adding that the fast was only a token protest. The party would intensify its agitation if the hike was not withdrawn, he added. Participation of INDIA bloc constituents In a significant development, an Independent legislator, representatives of social organisations and Tamil outfits, who are usually associated with the INDIA bloc only in Puducherry, have participated in the protest. Extending support to the fast, Independent legislator, Nehru alias Kuppusamy, addressed the gathering and sat with the protestors for a few minutes. He said the recent hike was unwarranted and the subsidy announced by the government to offset the increase in tariff was insufficient. Representatives of social organisations and Tamil outfits also addressed the protesting workers.

            "content": "The Jipmer Resident Doctors\u2019 Association (JRDA) staged a pen-down protest confined to elective duties for an hour on Monday as part of a nation-wide stir to express solidarity with the month-long agitation by resident doctors in Kolkata seeking justice in the rape-murder of a PG trainee at the RG Kar Hospital. The JRDA rescheduled its pen-down stir planned initially during the forenoon to 4 p.m. following a request from the administration. They also took out a rally in the Jipmer campus from the OPD screening section to the Administration Block. Resident doctors also formed a human chain in a symbolic gesture of solidarity with the All India Resident and Junior Doctors\u2019 Joint Action Forum (AIJAF) that had called for a nation-wide protest in support of counterparts in Kolkata a day prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s next hearing on the rape-murder case. The core demands of the medicos\u2019 stir include expeditious justice in the Kolkata case and concrete measures to ensure workplace safety and security for healthcare professionals. Though the JRDA called off a ten-day boycott of elective services in August on the basis of \u201cpositive developments\u201d in the Supreme Court that had suo motu taken up the case, it had continued to hold silent protests, which have been backed by the Jipmer Faculty Association, as a means of sustaining pressure on authorites to address the key concerns of the medical fraternity while minimising impact on hospital services.

            "content": "The accused in the sensational case of rape and murder of a girl child in Puducherry has allegedly committed suicide inside the Central prison at Kalapet on Monday morning. According to police, the body of Harikrishnan alias Viveganandan, 56, was found in the toilet of the prison. Further investigation was on, police said. The case, which is at the trial stage now, had led to lot of political bickering and protests ahead of the recent Lok Sabha election in the Union Territory. What started off as a girl missing case on March 2, later turned out to be a heinous crime after police recovered the partially decomposed body of the child from a storm water drain next to the victim\u2019s house on March 5. Police arrested Viveganandan and his accomplice Kakka alias Karnas, 19, on the same day when the police recovered the victim\u2019s body. Both the accused were residing close to the house of the victim and knew the child and her family. Around 60 days after the incident occurred, the police had filed a 572-page chargesheet for prosecution of the accused under various charges including sections 376 AB (punishment for rape a woman under 12 years), 302 ( punishment for murder) of Indian Penal Code (now Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita), POCSO Act and sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. (Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State\u2019s health helpline 104, Tele-MANAS 14416, and Sneha\u2019s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050).

The video clip of the incident went viral on social media. Reacting to the social media post, several internet users compared it with the usual fights held in the Delhi Metro. It can be seen in the video that two groups are fighting with each other and threatening each other. The reason for the dispute is unclear, however, several media reports suggest that the argument began over keeping handbags in the cabin of the plane. The argument between the two families escalated to such an extent that other passengers and flight crew members had to intervene in the matter. Despite all efforts to pacify the fighting passengers, the spat did not stop and both started threatening each other. The other passengers can be heard advising them to speak politely. At the same time, the passenger travelling with his family threatened the other passenger that he would not be able to reach Delhi. Along with this, he also threatened the flight crew members by saying that no one would be able to go to Delhi. \"I will not let this flight fly,\" a passenger said while hurling harsh words at the co-passenger.",

            "content": "Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes on Monday (September 16, 2024) killed 16 people in the Gaza Strip, including five women and four children. A strike flattened a home in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 10 people there, including four women and two children. The Awda Hospital, which received the bodies, confirmed the toll and also said 13 people were wounded. Hospital records show that the dead included a mother, her child and her five siblings. Another strike on a home in Gaza City killed six people, including a woman and two children, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. Israel says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million. Here\u2019s the latest: JERUSALEM \u2013 The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says the first round of a polio vaccination campaign in Gaza ended successfully by reaching 90% of the children it targeted. UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on the social media platform X, that Israel and Palestinian militants had largely observed humanitarian pauses to allow the campaign to proceed. The vaccination drive showed that \u201cwhen there is a political will, assistance can be provided without disruption,\u201d Mr. Lazzarini wrote on Monday (September 16, 2024). UNRWA is the main provider of humanitarian assistance in the coastal enclave. Health workers plan to administer a second dose of the vaccine at the end of this month. The campaign was launched after the detection of Gaza\u2019s first polio case in 25 years and sought to reach some 640,000 children under the age of 10. Health workers faced a host of challenges, including damaged roads, gutted health facilities and ongoing fighting nearly a year into the Israel-Hamas war. JERUSALEM \u2013 Israel\u2019s defense minister has told his U.S. counterpart that time is running out for an agreement with Hezbollah to halt the fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. Yoav Gallant told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that \u201cthe possibility for an agreed framework in the northern arena is running out as Hezbollah continues to \u2018tie itself\u2019 to Hamas.\u201d \u201cThe trajectory is clear,\u201d Mr. Gallant added, according to a statement released from his office on Monday (September 16, 2024). Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones into northern Israel after the outbreak of the war in Gaza, which was ignited by Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack. Both armed groups are allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded to the attacks with airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders. It has threatened a wider operation, raising fears of another all-out war. Hezbollah has said it will halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but months of talks brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as part of any agreement to release the scores of hostages it still holds from the October 7 attack. Mr. Gallant told Mr. Austin that \u201cin any possible scenario, Israel\u2019s defence establishment will continue to operate with the aim of dismantling Hamas and ensuring the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza \u2013 by any means.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 11:47 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Watch: Is Israel winning the war in Gaza?

            "content": "175 individuals in Malappuram district have been identified on the contact list linked to the recent Nipah virus outbreak. Kerala\u2019s Health Minister, Veena George, has confirmed that 175 individuals in Malappuram district have been identified on the contact list linked to the recent Nipah virus outbreak. Among them, 74 are healthcare professionals, and 104 are considered high-risk due to their close proximity to the infected. Breakdown of Contacts and Medical Attention Of the 175 contacts, 126 people are listed under primary contact, with 49 classified as secondary contacts. Ten individuals are currently receiving treatment at Manjeri Medical College Hospital. The health minister added that samples from 13 people have been sent for testing, with results still pending. This outbreak follows the death of a 24-year-old man on September 9, marking the second fatality from the Nipah virus in Kerala this year. The state witnessed its first death due to the virus on July 21, 2024. Kerala has faced repeated Nipah outbreaks since 2018, which have heightened vigilance in the region. The virus, identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a priority pathogen, poses significant epidemic potential due to the absence of vaccines or specific treatment options. Containment Zones and Public Restrictions in Malappuram In response to the threat, the state has enforced stringent containment measures in five wards of Malappuram district. These areas have been declared containment zones, where all shops must close by 7 PM. Public spaces such as cinema halls, schools, colleges, Madrassas, anganwadis, and tuition centers will remain closed. Authorities have also restricted public gatherings. Events like weddings and funerals have a cap on the number of attendees. People are required to wear masks in public and avoid large gatherings to curb the virus's spread.",

            "content": "The Halasuru Gate police have registered a cheating and forgery case against a gang of six running a fake job racket for cheating several unemployed youth promising government jobs. Two of the victims, who have been working as a senior and junior assistant in Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) for two years on a contract basis realised that they have been cheated and complained to the police on Saturday. Based on their complaint, the police registered an FIR against Praveen M. Somankatti and Vignesh Hegade along with four others charging them for cheating, forgery and criminal intimidation. B. Lohith Gowda, the complainant in this case said that he met the accused in 2021 who claimed to be working in Bescom and Indian Railways. The accused claiming high-level contacts promised to get jobs in different departments. Following this, Lohith Gowda contacted his friends and relatives for government jobs and even paid several lakhs. The accused even asked two of the victims to join as senior and junior assistants in Bescom, M.G. road and Jalahalli division on a contract basis and even got the salary through executive engineer concerned account. The duo was asked to work on a contract basis for 18 months and promised to get them a permanent role later. After the deadline when the victims in March last year went to check for the update, they were sent back asking them to continue work for six more months. Even after several deadlines passed when the accused started giving evasive responses, the victim realized that they had been cheated and filed a complaint. Initial probe revealed that the accused were not the employees of Bescom or Indian Railways as they had claimed and that they were cheating gullible youth with fake letter heads and ID cards. The accused are said to have cheated many people. There is a similar case pending against them in High Grounds Police Station, probe has now revealed.

Kombans, playing in front of a boisterous crowd, cashed on to the chances through set pieces to score full points in the scrappy encounter. T.M. Vishnu (15) and Lalhmangaihsanga (69) were the goal-scorers for the host. There was no magic from Thrissur in the first half as Kombans enjoyed more possession and made more forays into the rival box. Kombans earned three corners in the first quarter and the opening goal came off the third. The ball was whipped in by captain Patrick Mota and T.M. Vishnu rushed in and headed it past \u2019keeper Sanjiban Ghosh\u2019s near post. Thrissur had its first look at the rival goal in the 22nd minute when it earned a freekick at the edge of the Kombans box. Marcelo Toscano\u2019s kick rebounded off the wall and the striker retrieved the loose ball and passed it to Vineeth who shot out from close. Thrissur showed more cohesion towards the end of the first half and had a chance to equalise. Vineeth arrowed in a cross from the left but Abhijith Sarkar failed to connect. The visitor off its timidity in the second half and the side strung a few threatening moves down the flanks but Kombans defence kept their shape. Kombans increased the lead against the run of play. The goal came through another freekick which was whipped in by Mota, Marcos Santos flicked it on to an unmarked Lalhmangaishsanga, who made no mistake. The result: Thiruvananthapuram Kombans 2 (Vishnu 15, Lalhmangaihsanga 69) bt Thrissur Magic FC 0.

            "description": "After a slash in the export duty on onions, the delay in updating the Customs Department\u2019s software is costing traders and farmers dearly",
            "content": "Three days after the Union government slashed the export duty on onions from 40% to 20%, onions worth lakhs of rupees are stuck at India\u2019s borders and ports, awaiting an update for the system, as a result of which farmers and traders have not yet been able to benefit from the export duty slash. Around 380 containers are stuck at various ports of the country, including the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (JNPA) in Navi Mumbai, while 90 lorries wait at two checkpoints on the border with Bangladesh, an official of the Horticulture Produce Exporters\u2019 Association (HPEA) said. Each container carries about 30 tonnes of cargo, and each lorry carries about 25 to 30 tonnes. \u201cThere is a technical issue in the Customs\u2019 portal. There are two serial numbers on the portal for onions. But the portal does not process the order. We are unable to avail the 20% export duty. We can\u2019t even send the onions with 40% customs duty. Our onions have been stuck for the last three days. Now we fear they will start rotting,\u201d Vikas Singh, vice president, HPEA told The Hindu . \u201cOur containers are stuck everywhere. Tomorrow (Wednesday) morning, almost 60 containers are planned to be sent to Malaysia and Singapore. The vessel has been booked. But if the containers are not cleared in the system, the vessel will leave [without] these containers,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost 300 containers are stuck at the JNPA since Friday evening. Nothing could be loaded due to lack of clearance. Fifty containers await clearance at the dry port of Janori in Nasik; 60 lorries have been waiting at Goja Danga check point on the Bangladesh border; and 30 lorries are at Mehndipur check point, also on the Bangladesh border,\u201d Mr. Singh said. He added that if the issue was not resolved within a few hours, 35 containers that were slated to reach Tuticorin port in Tamil Nadu early on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) morning, would also be delayed. \u201cTuticorin is the sub-port for Sri Lanka. The vessel, which has already been booked, will arrive on Wednesday. So those 35 containers will need to be cleared on Tuesday,\u201d Mr. Singh said. The HPEA is the only recognised association for exporters of onion, garlic, and horticulture, Mr. Singh said. \u201cWe have updated this [issue] to the Consumer Affairs Ministry, and to the Agriculture Ministry,\u201d he added. An onion trader who did not wish to be named rued the restrictions. \u201cWhen the government imposes restrictions, the implementation is immediate. But while opening the system, why is there so much of delay? Each container is worth approximately \u20b921 lakh. Today (Monday) is the third day and we are still suffering. On one hand, China is becoming very aggressive with respect to onions. And here, we face so many restrictions,\u201d he said. Sources in the Customs Department said there was a \u201csystem issue\u201d that was being resolved. \u201cEverything is being monitored. The communication has been sent to the concerned persons. It will be resolved soon,\u201d a source said. Published - September 16, 2024 11:29 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "Kejriwal's decision to resign comes after his release from Tihar jail on Friday, following his arrest in the excise policy case. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is expected to step down from his position on Tuesday. The AAP has scheduled a legislative party meeting at 11 a.m. to discuss and select his successor. The name of the new chief minister is likely to be announced at the same time. Kejriwal's decision to resign comes after his release from Tihar jail on Friday, following his arrest in the excise policy case. On Sunday, he declared that he would resign as the chief minister within two days, adding that he would not return to the position unless the people of Delhi grant him a \"certificate of honesty.\" The AAP leader plans to meet Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday to formally submit his resignation. Simultaneously, the new CM will stake their claim to the position. Legislative Party Meeting to Decide Successor Ahead of the legislative party meeting, Kejriwal held a series of one-on-one discussions with senior AAP leaders during the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) meeting on Monday. According to AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj, Kejriwal sought feedback from party leaders regarding his potential successor. Names being considered for the role include prominent AAP leaders such as Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj, Kailash Gahlot, Gopal Rai, and Imran Hussain. There is also speculation that Kejriwal's wife, Sunita Kejriwal, could be a potential candidate for the post. However, Kejriwal has ruled out former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia as a successor. Possibility of a Dalit Leader as Next CM Some AAP members have suggested the appointment of a Dalit leader as the next chief minister. Although no specific names have been confirmed, this possibility reflects the party's broader agenda of inclusivity. The new CM will hold office until the next elections are conducted. Kejriwal's Call for Early Elections During his resignation announcement, Kejriwal expressed his desire for early elections in Delhi, ideally in November 2024, ahead of the current schedule of February 2025. He emphasized that he would only return to the CM position after successfully proving his honesty to the public. \"I will sit on the CM's chair only after people give me a certificate of honesty. I will become chief minister and Manish Sisodia deputy CM only when people say we are honest,\" he declared.",

            "content": "Maharashtra has 288 legislative assembly seats and the state will go to the polls in October-November this year. NAGPUR: Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Monday said the constituents of the Mahayuti alliance- Shiv Sena, BJP, and NCP- have arrived at a consensus on contesting 70 to 80 per cent of 288 seats for the assembly elections. He hinted winnability will be the criterion for distributing poll tickets. \"The three leaders of Mahayuti (Eknath Shinde, Devendra Fadnavis, and Ajit Pwar) should be congratulated for vowing to win elections unitedly instead of quoting numbers. We will agree upon fielding winnable candidates,\" the BJP leader told reporters in Nagpur. He was replying to a query on NCP, headed by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, purportedly staking claim to 70 to 80 seats. A consensus has been reached on 70 to 80 per cent of seats and Mahayuti leaders will soon address a joint press conference, he said. Bawankule asked Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange to respond to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remarks on \"removing\" reservation. \"Rahul Gandhi is trying to remove the present reservations; what will happen to the Maratha quota? Jarange should respond to Rahul Gandhi's remarks,\" Bawankule told reporters. The BJP has accused the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha of making \"anti-reservation\" remarks during his visit to the US.",

A 38-year-old Muslim man has been arrested here for allegedly deceiving a Dalit Hindu woman into marriage under a false identity and then raping her, police said on Monday. Accused Danish, who went by the alibi of Dev, has been arrested by the Sahibabad police station officials here, a senior officer said. \"The woman initially met 'Dev' about a year-and-a-half ago while applying for a driving licence. According to her complaint, in April of the previous year, 'Dev' persuaded her to wear a 'mangalsutra' and establish a physical relationship during a visit to a Sahibabad hotel,\" Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Sahibabad Rajneesh Upadhyay said. \"They subsequently lived together in a rented accommodation in Dasna, where she became pregnant. Danish secretly administered an abortion pill, and it was only after the pregnancy was terminated that she learned of his true identity,\" Upadhyay added. Upon discovering the truth, the victim confronted Danish at his home in July this year, where she was allegedly assaulted by his family members, he said. Following this, a Zero FIR was filed at Kapurpur police station in Hapur district and later transferred to Sahibabad police station. A formal case was registered on September 12. Upadhyay said the presence of both the victim and Danish at a Sahibabad hotel was verified through evidence. Danish has been charged under BNS sections 115(2)/123(2)/318(4), 64, and 3(2)5 of the SC/ST Act and has been sent to jail, the officer added.",

            "content": "The Madhya Pradesh government and the State police came under criticism from the Opposition Congress on Monday (September 16, 2024) after a video of a police officer tearing off his clothes during an argument with the husband of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillor inside a police station went viral. The leaked CCTV footage from the chamber of the station in-charge at Baidhan police station in Singrauli district shows officers and others trying to broker peace between assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Vinod Mishra and BJP leader Arjun Gupta, the husband of councillor Gauri Gupta. They were arguing over the construction of a drain near Mr. Mishra\u2019s house. According to the police, the incident happened in February, and disciplinary action has been taken against Mr. Mishra. Singrauli Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Shiv Kumar Verma told The Hindu that an inquiry into the matter was ordered by SP Nivedita Gupta and action was taken against Mr. Mishra. \u201cThe SP had taken action and halted the ASI\u2019s annual increment for his in actions,\u201d Mr. Verma said. An officer from the Baidhan police station said an argument had broken out between the BJP leader and the ASI. \u201cThe councillor\u2019s husband had said something about getting Mr. Mishra\u2019s uniform taken off which, I think, agitated him,\u201d the officer said. In the video, Mr. Mishra suddenly begins tearing off his shirt and throwing it away. He is also seen yelling even as other officers try to pacify him and Mr. Gupta. The officer further goes on to throw his cap and belt. When asked if any action was taken against Mr. Gupta, the ASP said, \u201cI am not aware if the ASI submitted any complaint. That is a different issue, and we will look into it.\u201d Ms. Gupta, in a statement, said she had ordered a probe when the matter was brought to her attention about four to five months ago, and that there was a land dispute between the two parties. Slamming the police officer\u2019s behaviour, Ms. Gupta said she took action against the ASI based on the facts of the investigation and also suspended then station in-charge. \u201cIn the probe conducted by a Deputy SP-level officer, an old dispute over some land and drain had come up. The ASI\u2019s health problems had also appeared as his blood pressure had increased that time. But I took action as he disrespected the uniform no matter whatever pressure he was under,\u201d the SP said. A separate inquiry is currently underway to ascertain who leaked the video, she said. The Opposition Congress hit out at the government over the issue. Sharing the video on X, the State Congress said that the threats of a BJP leader forced a police officer to tear off his uniform. \u201cThe level of policing in the State has reached zero! Crime is out of control, criminals are fearless, and the police are helpless at some places and under pressure at others,\u201d the post read. \u201cThis means both the condition and direction of the Home Department have deteriorated under Chief Minister Mohan Yadav! How will the public get justice, when the police itself has to tear its uniform!\u201d the Congress said. The party has long demanded that Mr. Yadav gave up the charge of the Home Department alleging that the Chief Minister has not been able to maintain law and order in the State. Multiple cases of rape from Indore and Ujjain, violence against Dalits and tribals, handling of communal situations and police brutality in recent months have given the Opposition ammunition to target the BJP.

            "content": "Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh remained tense on Monday after multiple Hindu outfits protested in the city over allegations of stone throwing at a local temple during an Eid Milad-un-Nabi procession, and demanded police action in the matter. Police said the alleged incident took place in the afternoon when members of the Muslim community were taking out an Eid procession. Hindu groups alleged that some stones were thrown from the procession at a local temple and an assistant of the temple priest was injured. The alleged incident comes just a week after the neighbouring Ratlam district was on the boil over allegations of stone throwing at a procession taken out to install a Lord Ganesh idol and the alleged death of a person in police lathicharge on protesting Hindu outfits on September 7. A magisterial probe is under way in this connection. Mandsaur Superintendent of Police (SP) Abhishek Anand told The Hindu that the temple priest had given a complaint that 10-15 unidentified men attacked the temple and hurled stones at it. \u201cBased on his complaint and the medical examination of the injured person, we have registered a case on charges of stone throwing and assault,\u201d Mr. Anand said, adding that the police were now scanning CCTV footage from the area around temple. The SP said that after the alleged incident, members of the Hindu outfits arrived at the temple to protest, demanding that the Eid procession be ended quickly. \u201cThe police beefed up security and the procession was taken out on the approved route and ended in time peacefully,\u201d he said. Speaking to reporters, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Ratlam Range, Manoj Kumar Singh, said, \u201cDuring a procession, attempts were made by a particular community to create unrest in the city, and there were some violent actions taken by them.\u201d Mr. Singh said that the situation was brought under control by the police who are now working to identify the accused. \u201cEverything is peaceful now and the upcoming festivals will be celebrated properly,\u201d he said. Mr. Anand also said that a meeting of representatives of various communities and citizen groups was held in the evening and an appeal to maintain peace was made. The SP, in a video message, also asked people to avoid believing and sharing misinformation and report it to the police. Police force and officers from 8-10 neighbouring police stations had been brought in, and 80 personnel of the reserved force had also been deployed in the city, he said.

            "content": "Super sub Alaeddine Ajaraie found the target in injury-time as NorthEast United FC prevailed over debutant Mohammedan SC by a solitary goal in their ISL match at the Kishore Bharati Stadium here on Monday. Mohammedan, which defended well and also created a few opportunities, saw its maiden league contest end in a heartbreak as Ajaraie struck late. The opening period was a battle between the Mohammedan defence and NorthEast attack. The visitors had an early chance but could not cause any damage as striker Guillermo Fernandez\u2019s left-footer went wide. Mohammedan lacked sharpness in the transition stage and looked hesitant in the attacking third. It was NEUFC which came close to scoring in the 36th minute but the opportunity went abegging as midfielder M.S. Jithin was off-target. The change of ends did not alter things as Mohammedan continued to be defensive. The few incursions it managed did not work well. NEUFC was determined to prove that its Durand Cup triumph was no flash in the pan, but was kept at bay by a resolute home defence till the fourth minute of extra-time. However, the match turned on its head when Ajaraie fired home a Thoi Singh assist to secure full points for the Highlanders. The result: Mohammedan SC 0 lost to NorthEast United FC 1 (Ajaraie 90+4).

            "content": "Bangladesh has had a tough last few months, dealing with internal political turmoil followed by floods that affected the daily lives of scores of its citizens. Even as things were on the boil at home, the cricket team pulled off a stunning upset away in Pakistan, sweeping the two-Test series 2-0 recently, bringing some succour to the embattled nation. Fresh from the historic series win, Najmul Hossain Shanto\u2019s men embark on their next big challenge, searching for their first Test victory against India. The two-match series, though, will be a much more daunting task. It will be a true test of how far the outfit has come in the longest format, for India has lost just four Tests in its backyard in the last decade. The visitors have a balanced squad to give India a run for its money as compared to their visit four years ago. Key batters like Mushfiqur Rahim, Litton Das and all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz starred in the triumph over Pakistan. Litton and Miraz\u2019s tenacity \u2014 they rescued the side from 26 for six with a 165-run stand in the second Test \u2014 should give the squad confidence. On the bowling front, Bangladesh will feel it has the right mix of pace and spin to counter Rohit Sharma\u2019s men on any type of surface. In the second Test against Pakistan, the pace trio of Taskin Ahmed, Nahid Rana and Hasan Mahmud took all 10 wickets in the second essay while off-spinner Miraz finished with a series-high 10 scalps. Prior to its journey to India, the team had a camp in Mirpur. The Tigers slogged out in the hot sun for over three hours during their first practice session at the MAC Stadium on Monday. Skipper Shanto and opener Zakir Hasan were among the first to have long batting sessions against pace and spin. All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who was playing for Surrey, is expected to join the squad on Tuesday. In the morning, India had its third training session in four days. With the match expected to be played on a red-soil pitch, the home team trained on a track of similar nature which offered good bounce and carry for the pacers. The batters fine-tuned their sweeps and reverse sweeps. While Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and K.L. Rahul looked in fine touch, opener Yashasvi Jaiswal played and missed while facing the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep. In 2019, India had laid out seamer-friendly strips in Indore and Kolkata (day-night Test), where the quicks took 33 out of the 40 wickets and the host recorded innings wins. That strategy could be employed again. Published - September 16, 2024 11:10 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Haryana Election 2024: With a few weeks left for Haryana assembly elections, the BJP and the Congress are working hard to woo the voters. While the BJP has accused the Congress of factionalism within the party with multiple CM candidates, the same problem is now hurting the saffron party. In Haryana, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini's position is being eyed by his colleagues. After the scramble for tickets in the Haryana BJP, there's now a race to become the Chief Minister. After Union Minister of State Rao Inderjit Singh, now Haryana BJP's prominent leader Anil Vij has staked his claim for the Chief Minister's chair, creating challenges for the BJP leadership right before the elections. In today's DNA, Zee News decoded the challenge that the BJP is facing in Haryana: \u0917\u0923\u092a\u0924\u093f \u092c\u092a\u094d\u092a\u093e \u0915\u094b \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0928\u0947 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u092f\u093e '\u092c\u092a\u094d\u092a\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0908\u091c\u093e\u0928'?

I have been an MLA for six terms and am the most senior here. But today, I am asking \u2014 I am staking my claim for the Chief Minister's position...The people of Ambala have continuously demanded this. Whether or not the leadership appoints me, but if I become the Chief Minister, I will change the fate and face of Haryana,\" said Vij, staking claim to the CM post. Anil Vij, the former Home Minister of Haryana, who wasn't given a place in Nayab Saini's cabinet by the BJP leadership, is now directly staking his claim for the Chief Minister's post. Anil Vij is not the first one to express his desire to become the Chief Minister. Before him, Union Minister Rao Inderjit Singh had also staked his claim for the Chief Minister's position. \"The people here want me to become the CM. If the people here hadn't supported BJP, Manohar Lal Khattar wouldn't have become the Chief Minister of Haryana twice,\" said Rao Inderjit Singh on September 9. The race for the Chief Minister's position within Haryana BJP continues even though three months ago, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had made it clear that the BJP would contest the elections with Nayab Singh Saini as its face for the Chief Minister's position.",

            "content": "The Ministry of External Affairs on Monday rebuked Tehran over the recent remarks made by Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei regarding Muslims in India. In dia issued a statement condemning the remarks and said, \"We strongly deplore the comments made regarding minorities in India by the Supreme Leader of Iran. These are misinformed and unacceptable.\" In its statement, the MEA also advised countries making statements on minorities in India to look at their record. The statement read, \"Countries commenting on minorities are advised to look at their own record before making any observations about others.\" India's statement came hours after Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei said that one can not consider oneself a Muslim if they are oblivious to the sufferings of Muslims in Myanmar, Gaza and India. In a post on X, Khamenei said, \"The attempt of the enemies of Islam has been to make us indifferent to the unique identity called \"Islamic Ummah\", one cannot consider oneself a Muslim and at the same time be oblivious to the sufferings that a Muslim goes through at Myanmar, at Gaza, in India or elsewhere.\" Khamenei gave the statement while he faced backlash at home for curbing women's rights and imposing a burqa and hijab. Earlier in the day, thousands of women hit the street in Tehran marking the second death anniversary of Mahasa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after she was arrested by Iran's morality police for not wearing hijab. Amini's death sparked a series of protests. Eventually, she became the symbol of resistance for women's rights activists.",

            "content": "Medium-pacer Anshul Kamboj (23) was both surprised and hopeful when he was named in the India-C squad for the Duleep Trophy. \u201cI was not hoping for that (Duleep Trophy call-up), because I\u2019ve done well in white-ball cricket. Red ball was not good for me last year. But (after selection) I was hoping that maybe I will come in (into the XI) and play. I got my chances and I have done well,\u201d he said, after his team\u2019s second-round match against India-B at the Rural Development Trust (RDT) Stadium B-ground here on Sunday. It was his eight for 69, his maiden First Class five-for, that helped India-C secure a big first-innings lead. He was adjudged the Player-of-the-Match. What made this bowling effort even more special was that it came on a batting wicket, after the team lost its pace spearhead Sandeep Warrier to a hamstring injury. Kamboj and Vijaykumar Vyshak had to bear the extra workload in Warrier\u2019s absence. He had come into the tournament having played just 13 First Class matches. \u201cActually, not much was happening for the bowlers on this wicket. So, I bowled in front of them (the batters), so that I had the chance to get lbw and bowled dismissals,\u201d he said. Asked if there is one dismissal that he was happy about, he said: \u201cSaifu bhaiyya (Sarfaraz Khan). He is one of the best, has scored a lot of runs in the domestic circuit.\u201d India-B skipper and opener Abhimanyu Easwaran, who carried his bat with an unbeaten 157 (286b, 14x4, 1x6), felt good about having been able to bat for a long time since he came into the tournament after recovering from a hamstring injury. \u201cI was at the NCA for about two and a half months, and then I went to my Bengal team\u2019s camp. There, I batted and basically the preparation was just getting into match zone. I also played a practice match. \u201cTo be able to bat for a long period after my injury was good. I really enjoyed spending time in the middle, and I think it\u2019ll give me confidence for the next game as well,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a veiled attack on the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, on Monday said, \u201cCertain individuals filled with hate and negativity are undermining the country\u2019s unity and integrity besides maligning its image.\u201d The Prime Minister was addressing a gathering in his home state Gujarat, where he launched various development projects, inaugurated the new metro line between the twin cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar and a new train between Kutch and Ahmedabad. In his first visit to Gujarat after the Lok Sabha polls, he laid the foundation to various projects and inaugurated many, all worth \u20b98,000 crore. He also flagged off the Bhuj-Ahmedabad Namo Bharat Rapid Rail, the first Vande Bharat Metro service, and five Vande Bharat express trains. He interacted with the beneficiaries of a rooftop solar power scheme. \u201cSome people filled with negativity are targeting India\u2019s unity and integrity with the intention to divide the country. Those filled with hate are not leaving any chance to malign or defame India and Gujarat,\u201d he told the audience that had gathered at the sprawling ground of GMDC in western Ahmedabad. The crowd was brought in by several thousand state transport buses and local transport services. Talking about his Lok Sabha \u201celection victory\u201d, the Prime Minister said he was mocked and jeered by the opposition but he did not heed them. Instead, Mr. Modi said, he focused on working for the welfare of the people of the country. \u2018Positive interest in India\u2019 He said that the world was looking at India with a positive interest in all spheres. \u201cWhen the trust in India increases, our exports increase and more investment comes into the country. When the trust in India increases, foreign investors make investments in India. They invest in factories and businesses. On one hand, every citizen of the country wants to become India\u2019s brand ambassador for the whole world and is engaged in taking his country forward.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, in the same country, some people full of negativity are doing the opposite. These people are attacking the unity of the country. These greedy people hungry for power want to break India into pieces,\u201d he said in an apparent reference to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\u2019s recent speeches during his US visit. Hitting out at the opposition for talking about restoring Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Prime Minister asked if they wanted two constitutions in J&K.

Movement of traffic has been completely stopped on the bridge, and technical experts have been engaged in repairing the damage,\u201d District Magistrate Abhilasha Sharma told PTI. The bridge, which was built by the Road Construction Department last year, will become fully operational again in five days, she said. The incident comes in the backdrop of more than a dozen bridges and causeways collapsing in several Bihar districts in the recent past, including in Siwan, Saran, Madhubani, Araria, East Champaran and Kishanganj districts. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had earlier instructed officials concerned to conduct a survey of all old bridges in the state, and identify those that require immediate repair.",

            "content": "There is a need to go beyond the curriculum as every differently-abled child will show improvement, and so the teachers can\u2019t be rigid about it, said Sulata Ajith, founder-director, Sankalp Trust. Addressing the media here on Monday, she said that there was a need for early identification programmes as children with specific learning disability appear normal otherwise and with average/ below average IQ but without age-appropriate academic skills, showing a deficit of two years or more. \u201cThey will require appropriate intervention,\u201d she added. The school is celebrating their silver jubilee year and hosting a conference \u2018Learn 2024\u2019 on inclusion and empowerment of neuro-diverse children. Speaking about their two schools \u2013 Sankalp The Open School and Sankalp The learning Centre and Special Needs School \u2013 principal of the Learning Centre and Special Needs School Evelyn John said, \u201cThe school offers Class 10 and 12 academic stream training accredited through National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) along with vocational courses, such as data entry, sewing, weaving among others, which offer the individuals a chance at independency.\u201d Pointing out that there is a dearth of special educators in the field, especially those in specific learning disability, Ms. Ajith said, \u201cSankalp now offers a Diploma in Special Education (intellectual and developmental disabilities), a two-year programme. In our schools, we strictly follow the teacher-student ratio of 1:8 set by the Union government. However, it is becoming difficult to recruit qualified special educators as there is a shortage of such teachers graduating.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 10:49 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray on Monday said the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre has failed to fulfil promises it had vowed to implement in the first 100 days in office and asserted the country needs a new leadership. Thackeray claimed the opposition INDIA alliance will forms it's government \"very soon\", suggesting the Narendra Modi-led dispensation will not survive its full term. He was speaking to reporters after offering prayers and performing 'aarti' at Shrimant Bhausaheb Rangari Ganapati Mandal in Pune. \"It (NDA government) has been an absolute failure. If you see the promises that were made in first 100 days by the Prime Minister or the NDA government, none of them have been fulfilled. Today, the country needs a new leadership, a new government, and the INDIA alliance will come with a new government very soon. Count how many times in these 100 days, the PM was abroad,\" he said. The NDA government, which assumed office on June 9, has nothing to show in terms of achievements, the former state minister insisted. \"This is basically a statement of these 100 days. What about inflation, what about unemployment, what about peace in Manipur, what about development? There is nothing to show,\" he said.",

            "description": "Why has Tamil Nadu not received its Samagra Shiksha funds for this year? What are the conditions attached to the release of Tamil Nadu\u2019s education funds? How does the National Education Policy 2020 affect funding? Why is the three-language formula a contentious issue?",
            "content": "The story so far: Tamil Nadu is yet to receive this year\u2019s funds from the Union government under the flagship education scheme Samagra Shiksha. According to the State government, the Centre has linked these funds to the complete implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which includes provisions that the State has opposed, including the contentious three-language formula. The impasse has come to a head over the last two weeks, with a public war of words between the Centre and State erupting on X. What is Samagra Shiksha and why has Tamil Nadu not gotten funds under it? Samagra Shiksha is an integrated Centrally-sponsored scheme for school education from nursery till Class 12, with components for teacher training and salaries, special education, digital education, school infrastructure, administrative reform, vocational and sports education, with grants for textbooks, uniforms, and libraries, among others. The scheme\u2019s estimated outlay between 2021 and 2026 is \u20b92.94 lakh crore, with the Centre and States contributing funds in a 60:40 ratio. For 2024-25, Tamil Nadu\u2019s allocation under the scheme amounts to \u20b93,586 crore of which the Central share is \u20b92,152 crore, with a first quarterly instalment of \u20b9573 crore, which has not yet arrived halfway through the financial year. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin accused the Centre of imposing a prerequisite for the fund\u2019s disbursal, namely, the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for another Centrally-sponsored education scheme called PM Schools for Rising India (PM Shri). This scheme, being run from 2022-2027, aims to create 14,500 model schools across the country to showcase the implementation of NEP 2020, and has a much smaller project cost of \u20b927,360 crore. The Centre has sent at least 10 letters to Tamil Nadu from September 2022, asking the State to sign the MoU, which included an agreement to fully implement the NEP. In March 2024, the State gave an undertaking that it would do so, with Tamil Nadu Education Minister Anbil Mahesh saying that this was because the PM Shri MoU was being linked to funding for the much larger Samagra Shiksha \u2014 the delayed third and fourth instalments from 2023-24, and the full funds for the current year. In July, the State signed a modified MoU, dropping the paragraph on NEP implementation, however, this was unacceptable to the Centre. In his August letter, Mr. Stalin noted that States which had signed the MoU had received the funds, and in a September post on X, accused the Centre of \u201cdenying funds to the best-performing States for refusing to bow to the NEP\u201d. The Union Education department has taken umbrage at this implication. In response to an article by The Hindu , a Ministry spokesperson said it was \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cincorrect\u201d to suggest any such \u201c quid pro quo \u201d. However, the fact remains that Tamil Nadu has not signed the complete PM Shri MoU and has not received Samagra Shiksha funds. What is Tamil Nadu\u2019s problem with the NEP 2020? In a post on X, Mr. Mahesh said the State\u2019s objections \u201crelate to specific elements like the three-language formula and curriculum changes\u201d, and noted that \u201cTamil Nadu is already implementing many acceptable aspects of NEP through its own initiatives\u201d. He also warned that linking the release of Samagra Shiksha funds to full NEP compliance \u201cinfringes upon the State\u2019s constitutional autonomy in education\u201d. Tamil Nadu\u2019s draft State Education Policy (SEP), submitted in July, clearly indicates that the State wants to stick to the 5+3+2+2 curricular formula, rather than the NEP, which includes the pre-school years. The SEP also proposes five years as the age of entry to Class 1, as against six years in the NEP. The State wants undergraduate college admissions to be based on Class 11 and 12 marks, rather than a common entrance test as proposed by the NEP. The biggest hurdle, however, is the NEP\u2019s three-language formula. Why does Tamil Nadu oppose the three-language formula? The NEP 2020 recommends the mother tongue or the local language as the medium of instruction till Class 5 and says that all school students should be taught at least three languages, of which two must be native to India. This three-language formula recommendation has been in every NEP since 1968, and has been implemented in many States by teaching the local language, as well as English and Hindi, with Sanskrit also offered as an option, especially in Hindi-speaking States. Tamil Nadu has had a long-standing opposition to this formula, dating back to social movements in the pre-Independence era. From a widespread agitation against mandatory Hindi in the 1930s to violent anti-Hindi riots in the late 1960s, to protests against the NEP and Navodaya schools in 1986, there has been a consistent political consensus on the issue. Instead, the State implements a two-language formula, making it mandatory for all students to study both Tamil and English throughout their school years, and they are free to choose Hindi or any other language as an optional third. \u201cWe embrace Tamil as a pillar of our identity while also ensuring future generations are equipped with English proficiency,\u201d Mr. Mahesh said in a recent post on X. NEP 2020 says that \u201cthere will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any State\u201d, indicating that it is not mandatory to include Hindi as one of the three languages. However, this would still allow students to choose Tamil as a third language, to be studied for just a few years in middle school. All major political parties in Tamil Nadu have rejected this formula on principle. When Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked whether this \u201cprincipled\u201d stance against NEP meant that Tamil Nadu was opposing education in the mother tongue including Tamil, Mr. Mahesh responded that the State\u2019s policy has \u201calways prioritised inclusive learning with Tamil as a cornerstone, while empowering students with knowledge in English\u201d.

            "description": "While the election will see a close fight between traditional rivals the NC and the PDP, for the first time the Jamaat-e-Islami, a banned outfit, is supporting Independent candidates in the polls.",
            "content": "Campaigning for the first phase of the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly elections , in which the stakes are high for the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the National Conference, ended on Monday. Besides the traditional rivals, the electoral battle features the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress, the CPI(M), Independents backed by the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and Member of Parliament Sheikh Abdul Rashid, also known as Engineer Rashid, who is out on bail. Around 23.27 lakh voters, including 5.66 lakh youths, will decide the fate of leaders such as Iltija Mufti, 37, daughter of PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, who is contesting from Srigufwara-Bijbehara. All the 16 segments of south Kashmir\u2019s Anantnag, Pulwama, Shopian and Kugam, which the PDP claims as its bastion, will go to the polls in the first phase. In 2014, the party had won 11 seats from south Kashmir. \u201cBijbehara is not just a home to the Muftis but is our bastion. It will always remain so. I pledge to serve people not as a politician but as a daughter and a sister,\u201d Ms. Mufti said, as she wrapped up her first-ever campaign as a candidate. She is pitted against the NC\u2019s Dr. Bashir Ahmad Veeri, who too has campaigned with vigour attracting sizeable crowds in his rallies. Ms. Mufti sought votes on the resolution of the Kashmir issue, the release of arrested youth, ending the security crackdown and guaranteeing the rights and dignity of the people, besides restoration of Article 370. The PDP\u2019s Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra, who spent 19 months in jail on charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is contesting from the Pulwama constituency. He is up against 11 candidates, including the NC\u2019s Mohammad Khalil Bandh, a former PDP leader. Talat Majid Alie, who holds a PhD in Agriculture, is backed by the JeI. It is for the first time that the banned outfit is supporting Independent candidates in an election. The CPI(M)\u2018s M.Y. Tarigami is up against JeI-backed candidate Sayar Ahmad Reshi in Kulgam, which is set to see a neck-to-neck fight. The NC-Congress combine is looking at these elections as their potential chance to revive and expand in south Kashmir in the wake of several senior leaders leaving the PDP in the past five years and ahead of the elections. NC leader and former Member of Parliament Hasnain Massodi is contesting from Pampore and former Minister Sakeena Masood from D.H. Pora. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Ahmad Mir is fighting the election from Dooru and is pitted against the PDP\u2019s Mohammad Ashraf Malik. In Anantnag-44, the Congress\u2019 Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed will see a close fight from the PDP\u2019s Mehbooba Beg, also a former MP. Senior Congress leader Vikar Rasool Wani is contesting elections from Banihal. The NC-Congress has forged a pre-poll alliance, though fighting on separate manifestoes. For the first time, the BJP has fielded seven candidates in south Kashmir. The party is contesting from Rajpora, Shopian, Kokernag, Anantnag-43, Anantnag-44, Srigufwara-Bijbehara and Shangus-Anantnag seats. In the Chenab valley, with more Muslim voters than Hindus, the BJP is contesting on all eight seats and is banking on two Muslim candidates, Taraq Hussain Keen for the Inderwal seat, and Mohd. Saleem Bhat for the Banihal seat. It has fielded Shagun Parihar from Kishtwar, Sunil Kumar Sharma from Padder-Nagseni, Daleep Singh from Bhaderwah, Gajay Singh Rana from Doda, Shakti Raj Parihar from Doda-West and Rakesh Singh Thakur from Ramban. \u201cThere was a time when people thought the BJP wouldn\u2019t gain acceptance in Kashmir. The situation is different today. People are eager to listen to the BJP and understand our message. We are confident that we will win this election,\u201d senior BJP leader, and the party\u2019s election in-charge of J&K, Ram Madhav said. Engineer Rashid, released on a 22-day bail, also concluded his campaigning for the first phase in Shopian district on Monday. He targeted the NC and the PDP leadership for \u201cfailing to address the concerns and aspirations of the people of J&K\u201d. \u201cMs. Mufti forged an illegitimate alliance with the BJP to stay in power. Mr. Abdullah has added to the miseries of the people of Kashmir during his rule,\u201d Mr. Rashid said. His party is supporting 13 candidates in south Kashmir. Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, V.K. Birdi, on Monday said an elaborate security plan has been made for the first phase of elections in J&K. \u201cA multi-tier security system is in place for safe movement of security forces, security at booths, and polling stations. Quick Response Teams, Special Response Teams, and inter-district checkpoints have been made more effective to ensure seamless security,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Amid the ongoing political slugfest over Rahul Gandhi's remark on the condition of the Sikh community in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (September 16) in a veiled remark slammed the latter, stating that while many people in the country aspire to be brand ambassadors, some are trying to disrupt national unity. \"On one hand, every person in the country wants to be India's brand ambassador. On the other hand, some people, filled with negativity, are attacking the unity of the country,\" PM Modi said during a public event in Ahmedabad. \"Sardar Patel unified more than 500 princely states and integrated them into India. However, these power-hungry individuals now want to disintegrate the country,\" he added. Significantly, in reference to the upcoming Assembly Elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the Prime Minister during his speech further continued targeting the Congress and its ally, the National Conference, over their stance on reinstating Article 370 if they return to power. \"They are claiming that they will reinstate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. These people can go to any extent for appeasement. Filled with hate, they are leaving no opportunity to defame India,\" he said. \"They are persistently targeting Gujarat, so Gujarat needs to remain vigilant,\" he added.",

            "description": "Locals send out search parties to find 49 fishermen who had set out in three trawlers on Saturday. Contact established with 31 fishermen on two boats off the coast in the Sundarbans",
            "content": "Amid heavy rain that disrupted normal life in West Bengal, 49 fishermen, who had ventured into the Bay of Bengal from Diamond Harbour and Kwakdip near the Sundarbans on Saturday, are stranded in the sea. Local fishermen have contacted 31 men in two trawlers that had set sail from Diamond Harbour even as the third trawler with 18 fishermen is untraceable. Joy Krishna Haldar, general secretary of the United Fishermen Association of West Bengal, told The Hindu that they \u201cpleaded\u201d with the Coast Guard and Navy to send out search parties. \u201cBut they did not help much and said the sea was too turbulent. They said their rescue vessels are in the high seas. So we sent out six of our trawlers to rescue our fellow fishermen,\u201d he said. While two trawlers and the fishermen are being towed back to safety, families of fishermen in the third trawler have filed missing reports in local police stations. Mr. Haldar said the 18 fishermen who had ventured from the Kwakdip coast still remained in danger as their rescue parties have failed to establish any contact. West Bengal received \u201clargely excess rainfall\u201d between September 13 and 15, which continued till Monday morning when the three trawlers went missing in the sea. In its official statement on September 13, the India Meteorological Department, Kolkata, (IMD) had said, \u201cDeep depression over Gangetic West Bengal... it is likely to move slowly, nearly westwards across Gangetic West Bengal and maintain its intensity of deep depression till evening of September 15.\u201d It had issued a warning for coastal regions saying the sea conditions may likely be \u201crough to very rough\u201d and added, \u201cFishermen are advised not to venture into the sea along and off West Bengal-Bangladesh and Odisha coasts and North Bay of Bengal till September 16.\u201d The stranded fishermen had ventured into the deep sea in the search for hilsa, said sources. Officials also went around the coastal areas of the Sundarbans and urged fishermen not to go into the sea. They advised them to tie their trawlers and boats to coastal barricades. The local authorities have started a control room in the area to help distressed people. Houses collapse Multiple mud houses collapsed across Bengal as rain lashed 18 of the 23 districts. A woman died at the Block II area of Bankura district in a wall collapse. The victim was identified as Jyotsna Bagdi, 54. This is the second such death in the district this monsoon. In Birbhum\u2019s Nanoor area, a family of four were injured after their kutcha house caved in. Two children, aged 11 and 14, are in critical condition. In Paschim Medinipur district, multiple areas of Ghatal have been submerged. Locals agitated as flooding has become a yearly problem in the region despite multiple assurances by the authorities. Ghatal\u2019s Trinamool Congress MP, film actor Deepak Adhikari, visited the affected areas and assured the locals of immediate action. \u201cWater in the river is running above danger levels. We are assessing the gravity of the situation. We will ensure there is no lack of potable water and food. We will make provisions to take immediate action in case of snake bites and provide anti-venom,\u201d he said. Mr. Adhikari said the Ghatal Master Plan will solve the issue in the area. \u201cWe are in talks with all stakeholders. By this year-end we should be able to start the first phase of work. We cannot fight natural disasters, but what we can do is stand by our people,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Four agricultural labourers from West Bengal collapsed of starvation in Dr.MGR Chennai Central Railway Station on Monday after they reportedly did not have money to buy food for two days. One of them is on a ventilator in Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). The three other labourers who were admitted to the hospital are stable. Chennai Corporation officials rescued the homeless agricultural labourers and provided them food and shelter. \u201cWe have rescued seven persons from West Bengal, provided food and accommodation at the shelter for the homeless run by the Chennai Corporation. We are monitoring the condition of the persons admitted in the hospital,\u201d said Jagadeesan, City Health Officer, Greater Chennai Corporation. The labourer, who is on a ventilator in the RGGGH, has been identified as Manik Ghori, 50, of Mangrul village in West Midnapore of West Bengal. According to officials, 11 agricultural labourers from West Bengal had come to Tamil Nadu six days ago, looking for agricultural work in Ponneri, on the outskirts of Chennai. They reportedly stayed in Ponneri for three days and on not being able to get employed as agricultural labourers, they decided to return to West Bengal. On their way home, they stayed in Chennai Central Railway Station without having money to buy food. As they had not eaten for two days, four of them collapsed of starvation at 9.05 a.m. on platform number 4 of Central Railway Station on Monday. One of the eleven labourers had reportedly left for West Bengal in Howrah Mail on Sunday night, leaving the others in the railway station. They were shifted to RGGGH after being given first aid in Apollo Emergency Care Centre. The other three labourers \u2014 Satya Pandit, 33, Samar Khan, 35, and Asit Pandit, 35, also belong to the same village Mangrul in West Bengal as Manik Ghori. One of them has been discharged from the hospital on Monday, officials said. . Published - September 16, 2024 10:22 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "Trinamool Congress leaders continue to target junior doctors on strike in West Bengal. A key Minister and an MLA have ridiculed the resident doctors who are continuing their 37-day protest demanding justice for the woman doctor who was raped and killed on duty at Kolkata\u2019s R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9. In a video that surfaced online on Monday, Rajarhat-New Town MLA Tapash Chatterjee was heard saying, \u201cClapping and disco dance does not ensure the success of a movement. They can only ensure common people are inconvenienced. A true movement has a certain manner of progressing.\u201d In his public address, Mr. Chatterjee highlighted that the Chief Minister had visited the junior doctors\u2019 protest site outside the State Health Department headquarters (Swasthya Bhawan) at Salt Lake, invited them to her residence for a discussion, waited for hours on Saturday night for them to enter her house, and how she also offered the delegation tea. In a similar vein, senior Minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury on Monday strongly condemned the protests by junior doctors, calling their movement \u201chypocritical\u201d and \u201cmore than what is necessary.\u201d \u2018Political force\u2019 \u201cThere is a political force playing in the background. Do doctors dabble in politics? They are saying they do not trust the Chief Minister, but they certainly trust her when they receive their salary,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury told local mediapersons. \u201cThey are testing the patience of the common people, which they should not.\u201d He also alleged that protesters seek instability and that they deliberately wish to clash with the police. \u201cWhat kind of education have they [the doctors] received? The Chief Minister has manners, which is why she is not openly criticising their antics,\u201d the Trinamool Congress Minister added. Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress leader Kunal Ghosh shared audio clips that allegedly depict arguments between protesting junior doctors over arriving at an understanding with the government. He claimed that there are two conflicting groups of doctors \u2014 one which wants a solution and end to the deadlock, and the another which doesn\u2019t. In the audio of the phone conversation, two voices, allegedly belonging to protesting doctors, can be heard arguing. One of them said the other should take responsibility if punitive action is taken against all protesting resident doctors and chalked it up to the latter\u2019s unwillingness to carry forward discussions with the State administration. \u201cSome circles want this impasse [between protesting doctors and the government] to continue. Despite the Chief Minister making requests to them like a parent, some circles do not want to cooperate because they want this deadlock to continue,\u201d Mr. Ghosh said. \u201cIt is worth examining whether people with political interests are trying to mislead and exploit the emotions of the protesting doctors.\u201d Deny allegations Representatives of the West Bengal Junior Doctors\u2019 Front denied these allegations on Monday prior to their meeting with the Chief Minister. \u201cMany people have alleged that we have no intentions of conducting a discussion or coming to a resolution, but that is false,\u201d a protesting doctor, Kinjal Nanda, said on Monday. \u201cTime and again we tried to see whether the administration is equally willing to do so. The fight that we are fighting is to uncover the truth and ensure justice is served.\u201d Earlier, Trinamool Congress leaders Kalyan Bandopadhyay, Lovely Maitra, Kanchan Mullick, Udayan Guha and Atish Sarkar stirred controversy by making caustic remarks about the agitating doctors and issuing threats to them.

            "description": "According to sources, the BJP is likely to lead the panels on Finance and Defence while the SP will head the committee on Health. DMK and Trinamool will head one panel each",
            "content": "After prolonged negotiations, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has conceded the chair of Department-related Standing Committees on External Affairs, Agriculture, Rural Development and Education to the Congress. A notification is expected shortly. In 2014, with the Congress tally at just 44 MPs, the party held the chair of parliamentary panels on External Affairs and Finance. External Affairs was then headed by senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor and Finance by Veerappa Moily. Both sides have ceded space. The Congress had begun negotiations demanding External Affairs, Finance, Defence and Home Affairs. The government had refused to hand over even one of these four panels. It argued that since the Congress as the principal Opposition party heads the Public Accounts Committee, which audits all government expenditure, it need not be given finance. According to sources, the BJP is likely to lead the panels on Finance and Defence. Among BJP\u2019s Lok Sabha MPs are former Chief Ministers Biplab Deb and Basavaraj S Bommai. It is also likely to accommodate its two key allies, Telugu Desam Party and JD(U), though based on its numerical strength the TDP is not eligible to head the panel. Other parties Sources also said that the Samajwadi Party will be heading the Standing Committee on Health. Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav chaired the panel during the previous Lok Sabha. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Trinamool Congress will head one panel each. There are 24 Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committees. Out of these, 16 committees come within the ambit of the Lok Sabha and are chaired by a Lok Sabha member and the rest are under the Rajya Sabha. The committees provide an additional layer of scrutiny and accountability for the government, since these are non-partisan platforms where the members are not bound by the party\u2019s whip. With just four seats, the Congress has another tricky problem on its hands. In picking the chair of these four panels, it will have to balance the caste and regional factors. Much like BJP, Congress also has two former Chief Ministers - former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi and Puducherry Chief Minister V. Vaithilingam.

Mr. Khandelwal, who is also the secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), has also urged the central bank chief to initiate an investigation into banks\u2019 partnerships with e-tailers and their impact on purchasing patterns such as the proliferation of online mobile phone purchases using bank cards. Flagging \u201caggressive discounting strategies and bank cashback offers\u201d with discounts as high as 10% on e-commerce platforms, Mr. Khandelwal argued the collusion between banks, e-tailers and smartphone producers is distorting the retail ecosystem, with around 1.5 lakh retailers struggling due to these unfair practices, and over 50,000 small businesses shutting down already. This, he said, is also driving many small traders to rely on \u201cgrey market\u201d stocks, and asserted that \u201cknowingly or unknowingly\u201d, banks have become part of a cartel creating \u201can unhealthy, uneven market\u201d, posing serious challenges to competition and the fundamental right to trade. The MP also sought time with the RBI chief along with representatives of the All India Mobile Retailers Association. \u201cProtecting both retailers and the financial integrity of our banking sector is of utmost importance. Breaking this nexus is essential for safeguarding our economy,\u201d he concluded in his missive to Mr. Das.

            "content": "The Karnataka State Commission for Women has directed the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) to constitute a Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Committee within the chamber. The chamber has been given a 15-day deadline to respond. \u201cThe Supreme Court orders the establishment of a PoSH Committee in any workplace that has 10 or more women in it. It\u2019s high time the Kannada film industry had one such committee for women to have the confidence to tackle sexual harassment,\u201d said Nagalakshmi Chowdhary, chairperson of the commission. Ms. Chowdhary, along with members of the Film Industry For Rights and Equality (FIRE), led by filmmaker Kavitha Lankesh \u2014 an association formed in the wake of the #MeToo movement in 2018 \u2014 attended a meeting at the chamber on Monday (Sept. 16). They submitted a list of 17 demands concerning the working conditions of women in the industry. However, there was significant opposition to FIRE\u2019s demand for a committee that could speak confidentially with female artists in the industry to compile a report on the challenges they face. N.M. Suresh, Chairman of KFCC, expressed skepticism about the productivity of such a committee, similar to the Hema Committee in the Malayalam film industry. \u201cThe chamber\u2019s responsibility is to address the problems of the industry and provide appropriate solutions. Why do we need an additional committee? We encourage female artists to come forward and share their concerns with us. So far, neither the Women\u2019s Commission nor the KFCC has received official complaints of sexual harassment from women in the industry,\u201d Suresh stated. Kavitha Lankesh, President of FIRE, said, \u201cIf the industry\u2019s leaders believe that there haven\u2019t been enough women raising their voices for a healthier work environment, this research and the subsequent report will prove them wrong.\u201d FIRE has already submitted a petition to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, requesting the formation of a committee headed by a retired judge to investigate the working conditions of women in the Kannada film industry, similar to the Hema Committee that exposed widespread sexual harassment in the Malayalam film industry.

            "content": "Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has completed the cleaning of Okkiyam Maduvu waterway and has increased the capacity of the vents, way ahead of the monsoon season. This waterway plays a significant role in collecting excess floodwater from the southern areas during monsoon and taking it to the confluence point with Bay of Bengal at Muttukadu. During the floods in December 2023 caused by Cyclone Michaung, the carrying capacity of the Okkiyam Maduvu bridge was insufficient and hence it was decided that the vents should be expanded, according to a press release. \u201cSubsequently, to address this, a meeting was held at the Secretariat, and it was decided to increase the capacity of the vent to 200 m with an addition of 1.5-m vertical clearance. The work is part of the construction of a two-lane road on the bridge with a provision of three additional lanes on either side,\u201d the release said. The CMRL has finished the pile work for the two-lane road, completed the cleaning of the Maduvu and now, the five vents have bigger capacity to take in the surge of water. The CMRL will take up the remaining work when the monsoon ends. Published - September 16, 2024 10:01 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "The Kerala Police have issued an advisory about a scam targeting those transitioning to e-SIM technology. The alert comes as fraudsters exploit the shift to electronic SIM cards to execute sophisticated scams. The sleuths have highlighted the modus operandi of the scam involving fraudsters posing as customer care representatives from mobile phone service providers to deceive users into switching to the e-SIM system. The scammers contact victims, advising them to replace their physical SIM card with an e-SIM by entering a 32-digit e-ID through the mobile service provider\u2019s application or website. The victims are instructed to activate their e-SIM using the e-ID and to send the QR code received to a WhatsApp number given by the fraudsters. Once the fraudsters receive the QR code, they use it to activate the e-SIM, gaining full control over the victim\u2019s phone number. As a result, the victim\u2019s original SIM card becomes inactive. The scammers then exploit their access to the victim\u2019s mobile number to gain control over linked bank accounts, usually within a 24-hour window promised for e-SIM activation. In light of such threats, the police have emphasised steps to avoid falling victim to such scams. Mobile users have been advised to confirm the legitimacy of any calls or messages claiming to be from customer care centres. One should always rely on the official application or website of mobile service providers for various services. QR codes, OTPs (one-time passwords), or passwords should never be shared with anyone. Enhanced security features including \u2018two-step verification\u2019 should be utilised for all digital accounts to add an extra layer of security against unauthorised access.

            "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (September 16, 2024) inaugurated the fourth Global Renewable Energy Investors\u2019 Meet and Expo (RE-INVEST) in his home State of Gujarat, and said that India was at the forefront of developing renewable energy sources, including solar power, to fight climate change. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Modi said 140 crore Indians had pledged to make the country the world\u2019s third largest economy, and the renewable energy sector would power the country\u2019s rapid economic growth in the years to come. \u201cIndia aims to not only reach the top but to sustain at the position,\u201d Mr. Modi said, adding that the world believes India is the best bet of the 21st century. \u201cIndia is preparing a base not only for today but for the next thousand years,\u201d he said, adding that in the first 100 days of his third term, the government had taken multiple decisions to expand physical and social infrastructure. The PM outlined some of the major announcements of his government in this time, including the decisions to create 12 new industrial cities and eight high-speed road corridor projects; the launch of over 15 semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains; promoting research with the inception of a fund worth \u20b91 trillion; various initiatives to drive e-mobility; high-performance biomanufacturing and the Bio-E3 policy. The creation of a viability gap funding scheme for offshore wind energy projects worth more than \u20b97,000 crore was a big move to promote off-shore wind farms in the coastal States, he said. India has been well aware of its energy requirements to make it a developed nation by 2047, and had decided to build its future on the basis of renewable energy sources, including solar power, wind power, nuclear power and hydro power, he said, because conventional energy supply sources were depleting and were also highly polluting. \u201cIndia is the first G20 nation to achieve the climate commitments set in Paris \u2014 nine years before the deadline,\u201d the PM said in his inaugural address at the event, in the presence of several Chief Ministers and other functionaries, and delegates from around 40 countries. Lauding State governments for developing solar and wind energy infrastructure, he emphasised the government\u2019s target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030, and said that the government had \u201cturned the green transition into a people\u2019s movement\u201d. During his speech, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader also recalled his re-election as Prime Minister for a third term, and added that the country\u2019s aspirations were the reason for it. Mr. Modi also stressed that the poor, Dalits and deprived believed that the government\u2019s third term would become a guarantee for a dignified life for marginalised sections of society. India is on the path to constructing seven crore houses, more than the population of many countries, while four crore houses had already been handed out to beneficiaries in the previous two terms, since 2014, the PM said. The country is also working towards producing 31,000 MW of hydropower with an outlay of \u20b912,000 crore, he said. On the first day of the event, several States announced their plans for the development of renewable energy sources. Gujarat has pledged renewable energy capacity addition of 128.60 GW by 2030 \u2014 the highest among all the States. Andhra Pradesh has committed to adding 72.60 GW capacity, followed by Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh at 62.73 GW, 57.71 GW, and 47.63 GW, respectively. Minister of New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi said banks and financial institutions had committed to an additional $386 billion (\u20b932.45 lakh crore) financing by 2030 for project development.

Jammu and Kashmir Polls: The Congress party has released its election manifesto for Jammu and Kashmir, encapsulated in the slogan 'Haath Badlega Haalat'. The party said that its manifesto aims to address the pressing issues faced by the people of the region and has been crafted with input from a committee that engaged with various cross-sections of society across all districts. While the Congress party promised to restore full statehood for the Union Territory of the Jammu and Kashmir, it kept mum on Article 370 restoration, a promise made by its ally National Conference. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera emphasized the urgency of the situation in Kashmir, stating, \"For the past ten years, the situation in Kashmir has left hearts wounded. The long night has ended, and a new dawn is upon us. Haath badlega Jammu and Kashmir ke haalaat.\" Khera alleged the lack of avenues for people to voice their grievances, lamenting that \"Kashmir has become a graveyard of dreams.\" He reiterated that the manifesto represents a commitment to restoring the rights and dignity of the citizens of Jammu and Kashmir. \"Jobs are a right for the youth, pensions are a right for women.

            "content": "Former Director-General of the Assam Rifles, Lieutenant-General Pradeep Chandran Nair (retd), said the only sincere attempt for a dialogue between the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities in Manipur last year was derailed, when a video of two Kuki-Zo women being stripped and paraded by a mob surfaced on social media on July 19. In an interview with The Hindu , Lt.-General Nair said though the violence erupted around 2.30 p.m. on May 3, 2023, the State government requisitioned the deployment of Assam Rifles only at 8.30 p.m. as \u201cthey were still trying to figure out whether they can handle it [violence] on their own\u201d. The Assam Rifles is deployed for counter-insurgency operations in the Northeast and is the primary border-guarding force along Myanmar. Also read: Manipur ethnic conflict characterised by brutality: Data Lt.-General Nair said there were inputs about simmering tensions between the two communities since March 27, 2023, following a Manipur High Court order. The court directed the State government to submit a recommendation for the inclusion of Meiteis in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list and to consider the proposal preferably within four weeks. He stated that the Assam Rifles and Army had kept troops on standby even before May 3, when violence broke out simultaneously at \u201cthree to four places\u201d after a tribal solidarity march to protest the high court order. \u201cWe get criticised that it is a total intelligence failure, but we were quite aware. From the time the court directives were passed, the rumblings could be heard, the undercurrents were there,\u201d said Lt.-General Nair, who headed the force from June 1, 2021 to July 31 this year. He added that without receiving any directions, the Assam Rifles and the Army decided that there was a necessity to keep some columns ready. \u201cWe assumed that 15-20 columns would be enough at Churachandpur and Imphal, from the time of the court decision. After the State requested deployment on May 3, our columns were out on the ground within 30 minutes. If we we were not ready, then the killings would have been much higher, at least 2,000 to 3,000 people would have been killed in the first few days. The Inspector-General, Assam Rifles, was at the Chief Minister\u2019s Office at 3.30 p.m., yet we waited for requisition which came at 8.30 p.m.,\u201d he added. In the first one week, around 65 people were killed in the violence and in the past 16 months, at least 237 people had been killed and more than 60,000 people displaced. He added that one of the ways to solve the current crisis is through backchannel discussions among the two communities, adding that the Assam Rifles and the Indian Army initiated a dialogue between the two communities in June 2023 after Home Minister Amit Shah\u2019s visit from May 31-June 3. \u201cWe got in touch with some of the people, including from Meira Paibi and important civil society organisations, there was a lot of reluctance. Finally they agreed to meet, sometime in first week of July. We wanted to meet at a neutral place and it was agreed that it will be in Guwahati. But unfortunately, a week or 10 days later, the video of women being stripped and paraded went viral.... and then it took a totally different turn, the rest as they say is history... Because feelings got caustic after that, both the communities were not willing to meet thereafter. This was one of the sincere attempts we made, I am not sure of any other attempt made by any other organisation. We got the Army on board,\u201d he said. He mentioned that involving the political leadership was the next step. On being asked if the current crisis was a security or a political issue, the retired D-G said, \u201cSecurity forces can only try and arrest violence which they have done to a large extent... We saved nothing less than 2,000-3,000 lives between May 3-5.... by the third night we had 100 columns in place. The number of people that we put in our vehicles with no support from the State government, obviously because they themselves were in a flux, we transported hundreds and hundreds of people through night and day and saved them.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 09:53 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Manipur / Caste violence",

            "content": "Five youths were killed in separate road accidents in Thiruvananthapuram district on Thiruvonam day on Sunday. Three persons were killed and two critically injured when two motorcycles collided with each other at Kurakkani Junction, near Varkala, around 11.15 p.m. The deceased were identified as Anandabose, 19, Adithyan, 19, of Karippuram near Edava, and Jishnu, 20, of Punnamoodu near Varkala. Two others, Sanoj of Thottamugham, and Vishnu of Janardhanapuram, were admitted to the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital. The authorities blamed the accident on violations of motor safety rules. While one two-wheeler carried three riders, the other came from the opposite direction with a faulty headlight, the police said. In another incident, an Onam reveller was killed when a speeding motorcycle rammed a crowd at Sasthavattom in Mangalapuram. Sasthavattom native Shyju, 45, who had come to see the celebrations, was knocked down by the bike. The rider, Roshan Raj of Perunguzhi, sustained serious injuries. A biker was killed when his motorcycle rammed a tree near the Infosys campus. Anuraj, 27, of Poundkadavu succumbed to his injuries, while two other passengers have been admitted to the medical college hospital with grievous injuries.

            "content": "The Communist Party of India (Marxist) held a motorcycle rally at Payakaraopeta in the Anakapalli district on Monday, September 16, demanding the government take legal action against the pharma and other industries in Special Economic Zones (SEZ) that flout safety norms. They demanded that the government ensures strict implementation of safety regulations. Addressing the participants, CPI(M) State committee member M. Jaggunaidu demanded that the government stop being lenient towards factory managements which failed to implement the safety parameters. He said that the governments were doing injustice to those who parted with their lands in the hope that their children would get employment in the industries set up on their lands. The 75% reservation to displaced persons and locals was not being implemented by the managements. Mr. Jaggunaidu asked, \u201cWhat is the use of such industries which go on polluting the environment and ignoring the accidents caused by their negligence? What is the use if they do not even provide job security to the locals?\u201d The failure to abide by the pollution control rules was causing various health problems to the local people, Mr. Jaggunaidu alleged, adding that indifference of the managements had resulted in the death of 17 workers in Escientia Pharma and four workers in Synergene Pharma recently. However, cases have not been booked against the managements so far he alleged. CPI(M) district secretary K. Lokanadham, who led the bike rally, alleged that the central and State governments were neglecting the safety aspect while granting approval for establishing industries. He also sought provision of safety gear to workers and employees to prevent injuries and deaths at the workplace. CPI(M) district leaders M. Appalaraju, G. Koteswara Rao, R. Sankara Rao, R. Ramu G. Satyanarayana, G. Sriram and V.V. Srinivasa Rao were among those who participated in the bike rally.

            "content": "After causing a flutter in the DMK-VCK ties by raking the issue of sharing power, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder and Chidambaram MP Thol. Thirumavalavan, on Monday met Chief Minister and DMK president M. K. Stalin at Anna Arivalayam. He reportedly spoke in private for a few minutes and invited the DMK for the liquor prohibition rally to be held on October 2 in Kallakurichi. Mr. Thirumavalavan said the DMK organising secretary R.S. Bharathi and spokesperson T.K.S. Elangovan would participate in the rally. Mr. Thirumavalavan told journalists there were no issues between DMK and VCK. \u201cThere are no cracks in the DMK-VCK ties,\u201d he said, adding that the liquor prohibition rally would pass resolutions to urge the State government to reduce the \u2018revenue targets\u2019 for Tasmac liquor outlets and call for a national policy for prohibition of liquor. \u201cApart from what is being used for medicinal purposes, alcohol and drugs meant for retail sale should not be available for sale. Annadurai (DMK\u2019s first Chief Minister) had supported a national policy for prohibition of liquor. Perarignar Anna was firm about liquor prohibition and had urged the Centre to implement prohibition based on Article 47,\u201d he said. The party had urged Mr Stalin to push the Union government for a national policy. \u201cMr Stalin said he will support our demand for a national policy to the Union government. He also said the DMK agreed with the fact that liquor prohibition should be implemented in Tamil Nadu but there were administrative issues. He informed that liquor prohibition would be implemented in a step by step manner,\u201d the VCK leader said. In his representation to Mr Stalin, he said the State government must urge the Union government to formulate a national liquor prohibition policy, set up the Prohibition Enquiry Commission as it was done in 1954, provide compensation to States that are implementing prohibition to overcome loss of revenue, and ensure that the States get more share from the Union government for implementing prohibition. Sources in the VCK said the meeting was cordial with the Chief Minister and Ministers. \u201cNobody discussed the issue of why we are talking about power sharing right now. It looked like they had already discussed it among themselves. But, Mr. Stalin said the VCK should be with the DMK when it celebrates 100 th anniversary,\u201d said a senior leader. He also added that the VCK leader was unlikely to meet with AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami and invite the party for the liquor prohibition rally.

Against the capacity to admit 500 candidates, the admission to the programme for the previous batch was a little above 200, it is learnt. According to university sources, the vacant seats could not be filled since the B.Ed. distance education programme is meant only for in-service teachers employed in government or government-aided schools. Only those who had completed Diploma in Teacher Education and were working in government schools are eligible to upgrade their qualification with B.Ed. degree. The State universities have, for long, been urging the government to relax the norms for admission to B.Ed. Distance Education programme to include in-service teachers in private schools as well, but to no avail. There have been instances of private schools conducting campus interviews in colleges and recruiting fresh graduates without B.Ed. degree for the teaching jobs. However, the school managements struggle to justify their eligibility at the time of inspection by the School Education Department authorities. When there is a genuine need, there is no reason why teachers appointed without B.Ed. qualification must not be allowed to pursue the degree through distance education, a headmaster of a government school reasoned out.

Announcing this during the celebration of the 30 th Foundation Day of the NAAC on Monday, Ganesan Kannabiran, Director, NAAC, said: \u201cWe will act as a catalyst and help build a network of schools and HEIs so that schools can utilise the facilities in the HEIs.\u201d College students and employed youth will assist schoolchildren in fundamental areas like STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) through conceptual understanding and practical experiences. \u201cCollege students will be trained to boost their employability and build entrepreneurship. We will also organise camps on Indian culture and values for employed youths,\u201d Mr. Kannabiran said. NAAC to start give accreditation to courses abroad as well Mr Kannabiran said NAAC would begin accrediting yoga courses offered internationally.

In his Foundation Day speech, Karnataka Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot emphasised the moral obligation to develop the education system by integrating modern knowledge with Indian values. \u201cThe Indian higher education system is one of the largest and most diverse in the world, with over 1,700 universities and 45,000 colleges. Over the past few years, significant efforts have been made to expand the system through public and private efforts,\u201d he said.

The gang, known for its affiliation with the Bambiha gang and its staunch opposition to the notorious gangster Loresh Bishnoi, reportedly carried out an arson attack outside the businessman\u2019s home. Luxury cars parked at the residence were set ablaze, as captured in a video circulating on social media. The gang\u2019s claim of responsibility was accompanied by a post asserting that the businessman was targeted due to his alleged connections with a rival gang. However, India TV does not independently verify the claim. The post also references a recent shooting incident at the Highway King Hotel on the Rajasthan-Delhi border, which the gang claimed credit for.

            "content": "Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy launched a scathing attack on Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) leaders saying they would never understand the true meaning of sacrifice and the sacrifices made by the Nehru-Gandhi family as their 10-year rule focussed only on looting Telangana. The Chief Minister, who unveiled Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s statue in front of the Secretariat on Monday, reiterated his charge that the BRS deliberately didn\u2019t install the Telangana Talli statue as the space was reserved for a statue of BRS chief K. Chandrashekhar Rao. He said Rajiv Gandhi was responsible for the technological revolution in the country and BRS leader K. T. Rama Rao was one of the beneficiaries of that revolution like lakhs of Indians abroad. Questioning the BRS opposition to Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s statue, he said wasn\u2019t it Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s wife Sonia Gandhi who gave Telangana fully aware that the party would lose Andhra Pradesh forever? Sonia sacrificed for Telangana and those who looted Telangana have no right to question. Sacrifice is staying away from power like Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and not enjoying power unlike KCR\u2019s family which not only stayed in power for 10 years taking all political positions. Further, KCR could build farmhouses on hundreds of acres, a new vastu-compliant Secretariat intending to change his son\u2019s fortunes, and Pragati Bhavan spending thousands of crores but didn\u2019t have time for the Telangana Tallli statue in 10 years. The actual reason was that the present space was reserved for KCR\u2019s statue, he claimed. Recalling Chakali Ilamma\u2019s resolve that feudal lords\u2019 palatial houses should be overgrown with weeds and abandoned forever, the Chief Minister warned that Congress would not rest till the farmhouses of KCR\u2019s family see a similar plight. Mr. Revanth Reddy said a massive Telangana Talli statue would be installed inside the Secretariat on December 9 this year, he asked R&B Minister Komatireddy Venkata Reddy to show the Congress party\u2019s true respect for Telangana Talli. Attacks KCR Questioning KCR\u2019s respect for Telangana, he reminded that the former CM did not even pay his last respects to the noted Telangana fighter Konda Laxman Bapuji, who sacrificed his residence for the launch of the TRS party. \u201cWe have named Indian Institute of Handloom Technology after Konda Bapuji, Women\u2019s university after Chakali Ilamma and now the Telugu University would be named after Suravaram Pratap Reddy,\u201d he declared. TPCC president Mahesh Kumar Goud, all the ministers and senior leaders of the party attended the programme.

An investigation is under way and the number of accomplices to Mr. Kamble is expected to be more, given the large number of affected candidates.

Hundreds of students gathered outside the Vice-Chancellor's office, and held a sit-in to demand justice for the deceased. The protesting students chanted slogans calling for accountability from the university. They carried posters reading - \"Justice for Gautam\" and \"Don't Let the Suicide Note Disappear\". Protesters also demanded the resignation of warden Rakesh Kumar, accusing him of expelling the students without conducting a proper investigation. According to IP University registrar Kamal Pathak, the university administration has 'relieved' hostel warden Rakesh Kumar of his duties after students staged protests. As per the expulsion order dated September 14, Gautam and five other students were removed from hostel residency for consuming alcohol and narcotic substances. The order prohibited them from entering the hostel premises and directed them to vacate their rooms by 2 pm on September 15. Gautam Kumar, a first-year MBA student, allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the seventh floor of his hostel building on Sunday. He was a native of Vaishali in Bihar and was enrolled at the IP University main campus in Dwarka Sector-16, Southwest Delhi. He was expelled for allegedly consuming alcohol and narcotic substances in his hostel room along with five other students.

            "content": "As part of the Kremlin's efforts to address the birth rate issue, workers are being encouraged to use their lunch and coffee breaks to focus on family expansion. In response to Russia\u2019s plummeting birth rate, President Vladimir Putin is reportedly encouraging citizens to make use of their work breaks for intimate relations. The country\u2019s fertility rate, currently standing at around 1.5 children per woman, falls significantly short of the 2.1 children per woman required to sustain population growth. According to the report by the 'Metro', This suggestion comes as Russia faces a population crisis, exacerbated by a declining birth rate and significant emigration, particularly of younger people, amid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. Putin\u2019s Call to Action According to media reports, Putin has emphasized the importance of increasing the population. \"The preservation of the Russian people is our highest national priority. The fate of Russia depends on how many of us there will be. It is a matter of national importance,\" he reportedly stated. As part of the Kremlin's efforts to address the birth rate issue, workers are being encouraged to use their lunch and coffee breaks to focus on family expansion. Dr. Yevgeny Shestopalov, Russia\u2019s Health Minister, highlighted the need to prioritize family planning, dismissing the notion that busy work schedules are a valid reason to delay having children. When questioned about how those working long hours could find time to focus on starting families, he suggested taking advantage of their break times. Alarming Decline in Births Russia\u2019s birth rate has hit its lowest level since 1999. In June 2024, the number of live births fell below 100,000, raising alarms about the country\u2019s demographic future. Data from Russia\u2019s national statistics agency, Rosstat, reveals that 16,000 fewer children were born between January and June 2024 compared to the same period the previous year. This sharp decline is accompanied by a rise in deaths, with 49,000 more deaths recorded in 2024, further compounding the population decrease. The ongoing conflict with Ukraine has also contributed to these demographic issues, with over a million Russians\u2014predominantly young people\u2014having left the country in recent years.",

            "description": "ED initiated probe on basis of several FIRs by various State police. Chinese scammers were part of their network",
            "content": "The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) have arrested four persons in a case related to cyber fraud. All the four accused were involved in incorporation of shell companies and opening of bank accounts, through which the proceeds of crime (PoC) generated from cyber scam were laundered. The arrested men have been identified as Tamilarasan Kuppan, 29, Prakash, 26, Aravindan, 23, and Ajith, 28, from Pallipattu. A Special Court, Bengaluru has granted ED custody of four days. Further, the ED has frozen PoC of \u20b92.8 crore in the bank account of a shell company M/s Cyberforest Technology Private Limited, run by the four persons ED initiated an investigation on the basis of several FIRs registered by various State police all over the country, including FIR No. 330 dated September 3, registered by Special Offences and Cyber Crime Police, Jaipur. The victim of the cyber fraud received a call from a mobile number wherein a person claimed to be calling from the Bombay Customs Office. During the call, it was communicated to the victim that illegal goods were being sent abroad under the victim\u2019s name. Then the victim was instructed to make a \u2018fund legalisation\u2019 payment as a security to ensure that no money had been illegally earned by the victim. A total amount of \u20b92.16 crore was asked to be transferred by the fraudsters in three separate instalments into three different accounts provided by the caller, under the guise of \u2018fund legalisation\u2019. Subsequently, an individual who claimed to be a CBI officer, contacted the victim over mobile phone. The fraudster continued to assert that he was a CBI officer. Furthermore, a call was received by the victim from someone who claimed to be DCP of Delhi Police, to verify the authenticity of the so-called CBI officer. On the insistence of so-called government officials, the victim was relieved of his entire life savings and investments, amounting to \u20b92.16 crore. By way of swift action by the ED, PoC to the tune of \u20b92.8 crore have been frozen in a Bandhan Bank account of the shell company M/s Cyberforest Technology Private Limited last Thursday, in which the proceeds were transferred by the victim. \u201cThe whole process and activities related to transactions in the bank accounts of these shell companies were done through a WhatsApp group where Tamilarasan, Ajith, Aravindan, Prakash along with Chinese scammers were members. Investigation has revealed that Tamilarasan, one of the arrested persons was in contact with Chinese cyber fraudsters, for siphoning off the amount of \u20b92.8 crore frozen in Bandhan Bank,\u201d said ED in a statement. It has also been revealed that Tamilarasan, Ajith, Prakash, Aravindan were actively involved in incorporation of shell companies and opening of bank accounts of these shell companies which were used to launder the proceeds of crime generated from various cyber frauds. Tamilarasan, in active assistance with Ajith, Prakash, Aravindan, ran a syndicate to assist cyber fraudsters in arranging dummy Directors, addresses and documents for incorporation of shell companies and liaisoning with bank personnel for opening of accounts through which proceeds of crime generated from cyber frauds were laundered. Earlier, ED had arrested four persons \u2014 M. Shashi Kumar, M. Sachin, S.K. Kiran and C. Charan Raj \u2014 on August 15 and 21 in Bengaluru. They are currently in judicial custody. So far, 17 searches were conducted at various premises which led to seizure of various incriminating material, including mobile phones and other digital devices and freezing of \u20b92.8 crore in the bank account. \u201cInvestigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 has, so far, identified PoC of more than \u20b928 crore generated from cyber scams. Further investigation is under progress,\u201d said the ED. Published - September 16, 2024 09:30 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "description": "If the government does not respond to the demands even then, a people\u2019s movement will be launched against the government in the district, they say",
            "content": "The five BJP MLAs of Udupi district and Kota Srinivas Poojary, Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP, alleged on Monday, September 16, that the State government is ignoring the district in development front. If the government continued the apathy without fulfilling the demands within the next 10 days, the MLAs and the MP would stage a dharna in front of the residence of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Bengaluru, they threatened. If the government does not respond even then, a people\u2019s movement will be launched against the government in the district, they said. Addressing a joint press conference in Udupi, V. Sunil Kumar, former Minister and Karkala MLA, said that the district administration had put the damages to properties due to the recent natural calamities at \u20b9240 crore. But the government has not released even a rupee as a relief. In addition, the government led by Congress did not announce any new project for the district in its two annual Budgets. It is because all the five MLAs of the district are from the BJP. \u201cIs it not sidelining the district?\u201d he asked. Alleging that the government has gone bankrupt, Mr. Kumar said that the government is frequently transferring taluk-level officials without valid reasons. District-level officials are not cooperating with MLAs in administration. He said that the government has not released any funds to take up pothole-filling works. Hence, the rural roads are in pathetic condition. \u201cAs a first step, we will stage a protest in front of the Chief Minister\u2019s residence. If the government fails to respond, as a second step we will launch a people\u2019s movement against the government,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. The former Minister said that the State government has planned to cancel 11 lakh BPL cards in the State. Of that, 40,000 cards are in Udupi district. As the government has not been able to reach out its guarantee schemes to all, it has now proposed to cancel the BPL cards, he alleged adding that it is a move to deceive people. The BJP will launch Assembly-wise agitation against it, he said. The MLA alleged that the district administration and Police Department are making unilateral decisions. The government is not adhering to the spirit and principles of democracy. MLAs Yashpal Suvarna, Gurme Suresh Shetty, Kiran Kodgi and Gururaja Ghantiholi were present.

            "content": "At a webinar held as a part of The Hindu Wellness Series on Sunday, doctors discussed the importance of early detection and prevention of cancer. Doctors from Naruvi Hospitals, Vellore \u2014 T. Allwyn Yabesh, senior consultant (medical oncology) and consultants Rahul Krishnan (surgical oncology), and G. Sindhu (medical oncology) \u2014 were the panellists for the webinar on \u2018Cancer : Prevention and Early Detection\u2019. \u201cWe are living in an era of non-communicable diseases, with cancer as the single biggest threat. But in 30% to 50% of situations, it is possible to prevent cancer if we change our lifestyle, behaviour, and exposure to elements that increase the risk factors,\u201d said Dr. Allwyn. \u201cThe remaining challenge depends on early diagnosis and effective treatment,\u201d he added, and advised people to keep obesity under check and quit smoking, alcohol, and unhealthy food such as ready-to-eat and frozen foods, which are ultra-processed and industrially manufactured with preservatives, emulsifiers, and artificial flavours. Dr. Sindhu showed a presentation on the importance of cancer screening to detect pre-cancers or early-stage cancers in asymptomatic individuals. \u201cScreening is a form of secondary prevention; timely diagnosis and early treatment can significantly improve outcomes by delaying or halting the disease progression, increasing cure rates and reducing morbidity and mortality,\u201d she said. She also reiterated the importance of mammography in women aged over 45 for diagnosing breast cancer and pap smear test at 21 years for detecting cervical cancer. Dr. Rahul Krishnan highlighted the importance of family history and recommended examination for breast, ovarian, colon, and stomach cancer, particularly among those who have hereditary risks and are aged below 50.

            "description": "The villagers were denied entry last month after the conduct of kumbhabhishekam by a group of caste Hindus",
            "content": "Residents of Vazhudambedu Colony in Gummidipoondi taluk in Tiruvallur district were able to enter and pray inside the Arulmigu Pidari Ettiamman temple after it was unsealed and reopened on Monday (September 16, 2024). The villagers, mostly belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs), were denied entry last month after the conduct of kumbhabhishekam by a group of caste Hindus of the village. District Collector T. Prabhu Shankar, who led the villagers into the temple, under the purview of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department, said that during peace talks, it was explained to the members of a dominant caste that they must live in peace with residents of the neighbouring colony. \u201cThe dispute arose after the Adi Dravidars were not allowed to use the pathway to the temple by persons of the caste Hindu group. Since the land actually belongs to the temple, we explained it to the residents of both communities and they agreed to come to a compromise,\u201d he said. The temple had been sealed on the day of the function to prevent deterioration of law and order. \u201cThe villagers had surrounded the temple on that day as soon as the yagasala pujas were completed. Complaints have been preferred by both the communities against each other and a First Information Report [FIR] against the dominant community was registered for discrimination,\u201d he added. Works to be taken up The Collector said works totalling \u20b978 lakh, including laying of cement concrete roads leading to the temple, and both the burial grounds of the residential localities, and construction of a shelter would be taken up. The temple was sealed twice earlier too due to differences between the two communities. A resident, who did not want to be named, said hopefully the temple would not be sealed again and people of all communities would continue to enjoy being able to worship inside the temple. Tiruvallur district Assistant Commissioner (holding additional charge) of the HR&CE portfolio K. Chitra Devi said staff members had been posted at the temple to ensure that there was no discrimination and everyone was allowed inside the temple. A police posse had been stationed at the temple to ensure peace and the situation would continue to be monitored by the local police officials, she added.

            "content": "The Madras High Court has refused to interfere with a decision taken by the Income Tax (I-T) department to transfer the proceedings initiated against lottery baron Santiago Martin\u2019s wife Leema Rose Martin and daughter Daisy Martin Aadhav Arjuna from Coimbatore to Kolkata. Justice Krishnan Ramasamy dismissed the writ petitions filed by them as well as Suvali Real Properties LLP against a notification issued by the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax in Coimbatore on April 25, 2024 for transferring their assessment proceedings to the central circle at Kolkata. Questioning the transfer, the petitioners had contended that they do not carry any business within the jurisdiction of the Kolkata central circle and therefore, the proceedings initiated against them ought not to have been transferred without even hearing them in person. However, senior standing counsel for I-T department B. Ramaswamy told the court that the petitioners had been carrying on lottery business in Kolkata, Nagaland, Sikkim, Assam and many other North Eastern States and that the I-T department had seized several incriminating materials during the October 2023 raid. It was brought to the notice of the court that the search and seizure operation was carried out by the officers under the control of Principal Director of Income Tax (Investigation) in Kolkata and therefore the latter had made a request to the Coimbatore office to centralise the proceedings against the petitioners. On receipt of such request, the Coimbatore office issued show cause notices to the petitioners seeking explanation as to why their assessment proceedings should not be transferred. The petitioners submitted their written replies in December 2023 but did not appear in person on January 2, 2024 despite being given an opportunity. Since the petitioners did not avail of the opportunity of personal hearing, the department had gone ahead and transferred the proceedings to Kolkata after rejecting the objections raised by them, to such a transfer, in the written replies submitted to the show cause notices, Mr. Ramaswamy told the court. After recording his submissions, Justice Ramasamy said the petitioners appeared to have objected to the transfer by citing various reasons including their inability to travel frequently to Kolkata since it would affect their personal and official commitments and the higher cost of litigation over there. He said though the petitioners had their registered office in Coimbatore, they appeared to have a place of business, directly or indirectly, in Kolkata too. Further, the seizure of the incriminating documents, linking the petitioners with the lottery business, had been made only by the Kolkata central circle. Therefore, it would only be appropriate for the Kolkata central circle to continue the assessment proceedings, irrespective of the location of the petitioners\u2019 registered office, the judge said. He also said the I-T sleuths in Coimbatore may not be able to deal with the issue effectively when the seizures had been made in Kolkata.

            "content": "The Supreme Court will examine on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) suggestions from petitioners seeking relief from States bulldozing homes and private properties of undertrials, and frame pan-India guidelines. A Bench headed by Justice B.R. Gavai had made it clear that the law did not permit retributory demolition of the properties of accused, who were still awaiting trial, or their immediate families. \u201c How can anybody\u2019s home be demolished because he is an accused in a case? The law does not permit that... Can it happen even if a person is a convict?\u201d Justice Gavai had orally remarked during a hearing on September 2. The court had invited suggestions from the petitioners for framing uniform guidelines against illegal demolitions. Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, the main petitioner, has suggested prior notice at least 45 to 60 days in advance of a demolition specifying the legal provisions under which the property would be razed and attaching personal liability on officers who violate the law through arbitrary action. The petitioner sought immediate and comprehensive relief, restitution and compensation to persons and their families whose homes have been bulldozed. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the petitioner along with senior advocate C.U. Singh, had in the previous hearing urged the court to make a statement that \u201cbulldozer justice will not be meted out anywhere in the country\u201d through its guidelines. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Uttar Pradesh government, had countered that municipal laws provide for the demolition of illegal structures. Mr. Mehta had denied targeted, communal or retributive demolitions by States. On September 12, another Bench of the apex court led by Justice Hrishikesh Roy had held that the alleged involvement of a person in a crime was not a ground for the demolition of his or her property. The verdict had made it clear that authorities could not run a bulldozer over the laws of the land and the court would not remain \u201coblivious to such demolition threats inconceivable in a nation where law is supreme\u201d.

SHAIKMOHIDEEN Members of Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Programme members on Monday submitted a petition to Collector K.P. Karthikeyan to highlight their demands including jobs permanency and pay hike. The petitioners said their working hours should be fixed at 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. after which no meetings, including videoconferences, should be conducted. The meetings on holidays and sending messages through social media platforms after 6 p.m. should be strictly avoided. Conducting of meetings at headquarters after 6 p.m. should be stopped. Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Programme members should not be forced to do the duties assigned to other departments, and the maintenance of breakfast scheme records should be allotted to the Deputy Block Development Officer (Nutritious Meal Scheme). All vacancies in the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Programme should be filled up, the petitioners said. Tirunelveli district secretary of Coordination Committee of Tamil Nadu All Farmers\u2019 Associations D. Abraham of Kaanaarpatti under Maanur union submitted a petition urging the State Government to either give permission to farmers to hunt down crop-raiding wild boars or instruct the forest personnel to do the job. \u201cEven though the farmers are clamouring for removal of wild boars from the Scheduled List of Wild Animals for the past several years, the government, especially the Ministry of Forests is not prepared to fulfil the demand. Even after neighbouring Kerala removed the animal from the list to protect its farmers, the Tamil Nadu Government is in no mood to fulfil the genuine demand of agriculturists. It is so depressing and this silence is disturbing,\u201d said Mr. Abraham in his petition. On behalf of Tirunelveli Driving School Association, its members submitted a petition to the Collector seeking his intervention to rectify the \u201cirregularities\u201d in the Regional Transport Office on the issue of driving learners\u2019 licence and driving licence2, among others.

            "description": "Despite presence of automatic signalling on the Whitefield-Hosur route, SWR has been unable to meet the increasing demand for MEMU services, particularly on the Bengaluru Cantonment-Whitefield stretch",
            "content": "With Namma Metro struggling with overcrowding due to a shortage of train sets, a similar issue is now affecting South Western Railway. Commuters, particularly those travelling on the busy routes between Whitefield and Hosur, are facing significant challenges due to a shortage of Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) rakes. This shortage has prevented SWR from running additional trains during peak hours. Despite the implementation of automatic signalling on the Whitefield-Hosur route, SWR has been unable to meet the rising demand for MEMU services, especially on the Bengaluru Cantonment-Whitefield stretch. The shortage has also impacted other routes, including Tumakuru, Hassan, and Hosur. Commuters, who depend heavily on these services, are now calling for urgent action to alleviate the growing congestion. \u201cThere is a shortage of MEMU rakes, and the Bengaluru division has already requested additional trains from the Railway Board. The line capacity utilisation on the Bengaluru Cantonment-Whitefield section is already over 100%, and while quadrupling work is in progress, the situation remains tight. Similarly, doubling work is ongoing on the Hosur route,\u201d a senior SWR official explained. This shortage has resulted in packed trains, longer waits and frustration among commuters, who are hoping for a swift resolution. For many, additional trains are not just a convenience but a necessity. \u201cWe need more trains, especially during peak hours. The current services are overcrowded, and at times, it is impossible even to board. With more trains, we can have a safer and more comfortable commute,\u201d said Harish Ramnath, a commuter from Hosur. Another commuter, Priya R., who works in Whitefield, shared her concerns. \u201cThe trains are packed, particularly in the evenings. If more MEMU trains are added, travel will be less stressful. It would also ease the burden on other forms of transport. Even the metro is overcrowded due to a shortage of train coaches.\u201d Rajesh K. Rao, who travels from Bengaluru Cantonment to Whitefield, added: \u201cIf we had more frequent trains, it would encourage more people to use public transport instead of private vehicles. This would reduce both traffic congestion and pollution in the city. The current situation is unbearable, and more trains would make a significant difference.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 09:16 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

A bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice J. Sreenivas Rao , however, granted liberty to the petitioner to approach the civil court concerned to ascertain their claims over the land. Three years ago, Sagi Hanumantha Rao of Burugupalli village in Gangadhara mandal of Karimnagar district filed a writ petition seeking a direction to Revenue authorities to correct land records pertaining to them. Mr. Rao\u2019s mother purchased lands admeasuring 64.30 acres in Kondaipally of the same mandal in 1963 and applied for mutation of the entire land on her name. In 2019, she realised that five acres of the total land were not mutated on her name and approached the Revenue authorities. The Special Tribunal of Karimnagar dismissed her appeal to rectify the land records. Challenging this, her son moved the HC in 2021. The single judge dismissed the petition observing that \u201cthere cannot be any hesitation to hold that the appeal is hopelessly barred by limitation\u201d stating that it was filed after 57 years. The Division Bench headed by the CJ, upholding the single judge verdict, noted that parties were not entitled to seek correction of revenue entries after long lapse of time. \u201cParties have to approach the authorities within a reasonable period, though the statute has not prescribed any time limit,\u201d the Bench said.

Meka Venkata Reddy, Kallam Anitha, Meka Subba Reddy and Meka Lakshma Reddy gave their lands to an extent of 7.2 acres to the APCRDA under the LPS to the Minister at their houses. With an intention to give confidence among farmers, who are giving lands under the LPS, the Minister himself visited the houses of them and collected the consent documents. On this occasion, he answered the doubts and questions of the farmers. Despite the APCRDA pooled more than 30,000 acres between 2014 and 2015 from the farmers in Amaravati capital city, still about 3,000 acres need to be collected. As the previous YSRCP did not wish to develop the Amaravati capital city, it did not collect the remaining lands. Hence the present NDA government has again started this exercise. Mr. Narayana said that after completing the LPS, the government would go for land acquisition if required.

            "content": "Hubballi-Dharwad Police have arrested 11 people, including employees of a private construction company, on the charge of causing the death of a police officer due to negligence. Assistant Sub-Inspector Nabhiraj Dayannavar suffered head injury when a rod from a flyover under construction in Hubballi fell on his head when he was driving to work on September 10. He died in the Karnataka Medical College and Research Institute (KMCRI) on Sunday. Following his death, the officer\u2019s son, Vrushabh, filed a complaint. The complaint accused the agency of negligence and failure to take safety measures. The police officers registered a case against 19 people, including directors of the construction company, and its employees. The arrested people include engineers, supervisor, crane operator, labour and a labour contractor. Some of the names were given as engineers Jitendrapal Sharma and Bhupendar Pal, supervisor Harsha Hosaganiger and labour contractor Mohammad Rabiulhak. More arrests may follow, the police said. Investigators found that the city-based office of the company was closed. Work on the flyover has been stopped temporarily. The Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad has asked senior officers to submit a report on the safety measures being taken at the construction site and other details.

            "content": "Senior doctors of R.G. Kar Medical College on Monday (September 16, 2024) alleged tampering of evidence in the Kolkata doctor rape and murder case. Addressing a press conference here, they reiterated their demand for a live streaming of the meeting between them and the West Bengal government. \u201cWe condemn all such heinous crimes. This crime is a fallout of the nexus between the West Bengal government and health department officials,\u201d said one of the doctors. The doctors alleged there was \u201ctampering of evidence\u201d. In a statement, the doctors have demanded that they want concerned authorities, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Supreme Court to expedite the investigation process and punish the culprits without any delay. Remove the director medical education (DME), director health services (DHS) and health secretary as their signatures are present in the order for construction work in the immediate auspices of the crime scene, when it should have been completely cordoned off, they demanded in the statement. The doctors have also demanded the removal of Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goel for his administrative failure and evidence tampering, disciplinary action against deputy commissioner (north) for his incompetence and offering money to the victim\u2019s parents, and deputy commissioner (central) for trying to hide the identity of a suspected person present inside the crime scene. They demanded proper security and functional basic amenities in all hospitals and government healthcare centres. Their fifth demand was to end threat culture prevalent in all facets of government healthcare facilities. In the statement, the doctors have stated that numerous attempts have been made to politically exploit their movement but have been successfully defied from their side. They said many false narratives and rumours have been spread regarding their movement but could never dampen their spirit. They stand firm, rooted to their cause in finding justice despite all threats posed at them and their movement, they added. The doctors are presently sitting in front of Swasthyo Bhavan for the last six days to make the state government fulfil their demands, it said. \u201cWe were looking forward to have a hopefully fruitful meeting with our CM to end this deadlock but two such attempts have failed on the ground of transparency. We have also mailed to the President of India as constitutional head of the country to address the current situation and our five-point demands. \u201cWe are patiently waiting for the next Supreme Court hearing on Tuesday (September 17, 2024). We appeal to the entire nation to join this protest for the retrieval of humanity. We implore everybody to resonate with our five-point demands of justice for Abhaya,\u201d the statement added. The West Bengal government on Monday (September 16, 2024) \u201cfor the fifth and the final time\u201d invited the protesting junior doctors for talks to end the R.G. Kar impasse, two days after the dialogue failed to take off over disagreement on live streaming of the meeting. In an email to the protesting junior doctors, Chief Secretary Manoj Pant asked them to reach Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee\u2019s residence in Kalighat at 5 p.m. on Monday (September 16, 2024) for the talks.

            "description": "Economists cite oil sliding below $70 as offering a strong case for a fuel price cut; stress that cheaper fuel will also help slow the pace of inflation and boost consumption",
            "content": "With global crude oil prices slipping below $70 a barrel, economists reckon there is a strong case for a fuel price cut for Indian consumers, stressing that cheaper petrol and diesel would also help slow inflation, paving the way for interest rate cuts, and boost consumption. While fuel prices are deregulated in India with oil marketing companies (OMCs) free to reset prices, in practice, prices have not been reset in line with supply price trends for a few years now. Retail prices for petroleum products have been static since March, when they were reduced by \u20b92 a litre ahead of the general election. \u201cWe believe that there is a strong case for another cut in fuel prices possibly by \u20b92 to \u20b94 per litre if global crude prices continue to remain below $75 per barrel over the next one-two months,\u201d averred Suman Chowdhury, executive director and chief economist at Acuite\u0301 Ratings & Research. \u201cThe decision on the price cut may also be influenced by the upcoming State elections in Maharashtra and Haryana,\u201d he added. \u201cGiven that India imports around 87% of its crude oil requirements, any significant price reduction always augurs well for the economy,\u201d he said, adding that OMCs\u2019 margins had risen notably in the current quarter. Bank of Baroda chief economist Madan Sabnavis said that softening oil prices would help control India\u2019s import bill and stabilise the rupee, but the impact on retail inflation would depend on government action. \u201cThe products where prices are driven by market like ATF should move downwards. However, fuel prices at the petrol pumps will depend on whether the Centre and States decide to pass on the benefit,\u201d he noted. Even if retail fuel prices remained unchanged, Mr. Sabnavis underlined that wholesale price inflation would face downward pressure if oil prices stayed in the $70-$75 range, while the government would see a lower subsidy bill on LPG and fertilisers. While there were concerns about the implication of the fundamentals driving the dip in oil prices, such as a slowing global economy, Mr. Chowdhury said if the fuel price cuts materialised, they would support the expected downtrend in the headline inflation trajectory, which already had the \u2018tailwinds of a good monsoon\u2019. \u201cIt may further put pressure on RBI to opt for a rate cut in December. Lower inflation along with a cut in interest rates is likely to strengthen consumption demand and overall economic growth,\u201d the Acuite\u0301 economist emphasised. Some manufacturing sectors would also see better margins, while domestic airlines could get some relief due to lower ATF prices, he noted. Further, manufacturing sectors that have a significant dependence on crude oil derivatives were also expected to see an improvement in margins in the near term. Some of these sectors, where volume growth has been relatively low, may also opt to improve the latter by passing on some of the benefits to the consumers. The transport sectors including domestic airline companies were also set to get relief due to lower ATF prices.

            "content": "Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK) party functionaries from Madurai and the southern districts staged a massive protest and attempted to block the Kappalur toll plaza in Tirumangalam in Madurai district on Monday. Hundreds of party functionaries who were present demanded the closure of the toll plaza. Condemning the Central government, the party cadre raised slogans and demanded the toll plaza to be removed. They said that the people were affected by the increase in the toll fee and urged for reduction of the fee. This will be a burden on the common man as it will raise the cost of transportation and prices of the essential commodities will increase as a result, the party members said. They said that in Tamil Nadu there were around 70 National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) toll plazas and more have been announced. Even in the toll plazas where the agreement period has expired toll fees were being collected from vehicle users, instead of closing the toll plaza. Condemning this, they said that protests were held by the party cadres across various places in Tamil Nadu. Crores of rupees were being collected in the name of toll on a daily basis and every year the toll fees were being hiked. The people were being looted as they have to pay the toll fees, apart from the tax, they said. They said that some of the toll plazas in the State even lack basic infrastructure facilities. New toll plazas should not be opened in Tamil Nadu, they said. The protests were led by party functionaries S. Mydeen Sait Khan, S. Sheik Ibrahim, Kader Mydeen, Palani Faruk and others. The party cadre attempted to block the toll plaza following the protest. However, the police personnel who were deployed in large numbers at the toll plaza apprehended the party functionaries. They were detained by the police. This is not the first time a massive protest has been staged at the Kappalur toll plaza. Only recently, the residents of Tirumangalam and neighbouring areas had staged a protest demanding the authorities concerned to withdraw an order of collecting 50% toll fee for local vehicles. The residents said that they should be exempted from the toll. The residents too have demanded the removal of the toll plaza. They said that the Kappalur Toll Plaza violated the rules. The minimum distance between two toll plazas should be 60 km. But, the distance between the toll plazas at Kappalur and Chittampatti near Melur is only 48 km, they had pointed out.

He complimented the Prime Minister for launching several initiatives like \u2018Make in India\u2019. Today, state-of-the art coaches were being made in India with indigenous technical know-how and our own human resources, he added. The railway stations, which were constructed during the British time, about a century ago, were now being upgraded. High speed and semi-high speed trains like Vande Bharat were launched after Mr. Modi became the Prime Minister. In future, Vande Bharat sleeper trains would be introduced. He also said that Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw was competing with the Civil Aviation Ministry by improving railway infrastructure and capacity. Visakhapatnam MP M. Sribharat, Rajya Sabha Member Golla Babu Rao, Mayor G. Hari Venkata Kumari, MLAs P.G.V.R. Naidu, P.

            "content": "A man suspected in an apparent assassination attempt targeting former President Donald Trump was charged Monday (September 16, 2024) with federal gun crimes, making his first court appearance in the final weeks of a White House race already touched by violence. Ryan Wesley Routh , 58, faces charges of possessing a firearm despite being a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Additional and more serious charges are possible as the investigation continues and prosecutors seek an indictment from a grand jury. Routh appeared briefly in federal court in West Palm Beach, where he answered perfunctory questions about his work status and income. Shackled and wearing a blue jumpsuit, he smiled as he spoke with a public defender and reviewed documents ahead of his initial appearance. The lawyer declined to comment after the court appearance. The episode occurred Sunday (September 15, 2024) afternoon when Secret Service agents stationed a few holes up from where Mr. Trump was playing golf noticed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle sticking through the shrubbery that lines the course, roughly 400 yards away. An agent fired and Routh dropped the rifle and fled in an SUV, leaving the firearm behind along with two backpacks, a scope used for aiming and a GoPro camera, authorities said. Routh was later stopped by law enforcement in a neighbouring county. It was the second apparent assassination attempt targeting Mr. Trump in as many months. On July 13, a bullet grazed Mr. Trump\u2019s ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania . Eight days later, Democratic President Joe Biden withdrew from the race , giving way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the party\u2019s nominee.

            "content": "The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has now digitised about 21 lakh property records in the city to implement a faceless, contactless online e-khata issuance system. Portions of it will be made public, allowing property owners to check the records online and get an e-khata soon. Now, property records are maintained manually in over 5,500 ledgers. Digitisation began in 2023 after directions from Bengaluru Development Minister D.K. Shivakumar. The exercise aims to reduce red tape and corruption over issuing khata, but at the same time also increase property tax revenue. The agency tasked with digitising records has finished the work. However, records of only 700 ledgers have been checked. The BBMP is conducting multi-level quality checks of the digitized records involving case workers, Deputy Commissioners, and Joint Commissioners. At each level, authorized personnel randomly select records to verify their accuracy. If discrepancies are found, the entire ledger is revised. The civic body plans to roll out the digitized property records of the 700 ledgers soon after integrating corresponding data from Kaveri 2, the database of the Department of Stamps and Registration. Once the system is launched, property owners will need to enter their names, complete an online KYC, and upload sale deeds of their properties (which can be fetched online from the Kaveri 2 database) to download an e-khata. Before the system goes live, the public will have a 7- to 15-day window to file objections. \u201cThere are over 2.1 million properties in the city. We have digitised the records of 21 lakh properties, with approximately 50,000 remaining. All properties from the 5,500 record books have been digitised. This system will bring transparency as owners won\u2019t need to meet revenue officials for e-khatas. It is also expected to boost property tax revenue,\u201d a senior civic official stated.

            "content": "The police and the Motor Vehicles department are planning a crackdown on private bus staff in Kozhikode to check drug abuse among them. Several incidents of violence among private bus staff were reported recently in the city and drug abuse has been identified as the primary reason for the violent behaviour. A couple of weeks ago, a private bus driver was attacked using a jack lever by another bus driver during an altercation at the mofussil bus stand in Kozhikode over time slots assigned to their buses. \u201cThere is less than a five-minute difference between buses plying in the same route. A slight delay by one may affect patronage in another. This often results in competition between the buses, rash driving and sometimes accidents,\u201d said G. Gopakumar, Station House Officer at Kasaba police station. Rampant use of drugs by bus drivers has also been reported, putting passengers at risk. \u201cThe drug abuse is affecting their cognitive abilities, adding to their criminal mentality, resulting in rash behaviour,\u201d said Mr. Gopakumar. The Kasaba police had convened a meeting of bus owners and trade unions to discuss the issue. The police have said that stringent action will be taken against bus drivers if they were found with drugs. \u201cPossession of drugs is a non-bailable offence. If these drivers or cleaners are found guilty in one case, they cannot rejoin duty without furnishing an affidavit before the Regional Transport Officer. Repeated offenders may lose their licence,\u201d said Mr. Gopakumar. He said the police, with the help of the MVD, was planning to conduct inspections at bus stands to check the use of drugs among the bus staff.

Fareed and Mr. Khader. All people of Bajal should live happily by developing mutual trust and cooperation. Religious scholar Sayed K.S. Attakoya Thangal Kumbol said that mosques have their own discipline and respect. They should be followed. He said that masjids should not become venue for discussing unrelated matters. They are the venues to offer mass namaz (prayer) and chapters of the Koran. They should be done regularly. Yenepoya Abdullah Kunhi, Chancellor, Yenepoya Deemed to be University, said that the renovated masjid should not become the venue for offering only Friday prayer. Instead, namaz should be offered daily five times at the masjid. Councillor of Mangaluru City Corporation and president of the renovated masjid Abdul Rauf presided over.

            "description": "Kerala State Electricity Board estimates \u20b942,800 crore investment needed to add 7,750 MW capacity by 2030. In 2023-24, the State\u2019s installed capacity \u2013 KSEB units and other sources combined \u2013 stood at 3,419 MW.",
            "content": "Augmenting Kerala\u2019s internal power generation capability is not going to come cheap, if a Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) estimate is any indication. The power-deficit State, which has seen a sharp increase in electricity demand in recent years, will need an investment of about \u20b942,800 crore for adding 7,750 megawatts (MW) to its installed capacity for power generation, according to the state-run power utility. The KSEB estimate gains significance in the context of a plan to raise the capacity to 10,000 MW by 2030. The investment projections are tied to per-MW costs for establishing hydropower, wind, solar and pumped storage projects (PSP) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). KSEB chairman and managing director Biju Prabhakar presented the estimates at a public hearing held by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission last week on proposals for revising the electricity tariffs. In 2023-24, the State\u2019s installed capacity \u2013 KSEB units and other sources combined \u2013 stood at 3,419 MW. Mr. Prabhakar\u2019s presentation at the hearing covered \u201cimmediate investments needed\u201d spanning different power sources, including those in the KSEB wish list such as BESS and offshore wind energy, for adding another 7,750 MW. The KSEB estimate calls for an investment of \u20b912,000 crore each for adding 1,500 MW through hydropower projects and 2,000 MW through PSPs. In wind energy, 370 MW can be added in onshore projects at \u20b92,200 crore, 50 MW through offshore wind projects at an estimated \u20b9800 crore, and 30 MW via vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) projects with an investment of \u20b9300 crore. Ground/floating solar projects will require an investment of \u20b92,500 crore for adding 500 MW, while 3,300-MW BESS projects will require \u20b913,000 crore. Cost per MW The per-MW cost of establishing the projects vary for the power sources, ranging from \u20b94 crore per MW for BESS projects to \u20b9 15 crore-\u20b917 crore/MW for offshore wind projects. For hydel projects, the mainstay of Kerala\u2019s internal power generation, it is estimated at \u20b96 crore to \u20b98 crore per MW. Current capacity accounts for only about 30% of Kerala\u2019s electricity requirement. The spending on power purchases to fill the demand-supply gap rose from \u20b97,393 crore in 2016-17 to \u20b911,241 crore in 2022-23 and \u20b912,983 crore in 2023-24, according to the KSEB. Kerala has been eyeing Central assistance for increasing is power generation capacity. For instance, KSEB proposes to implement BESS projects in eight locations with viability gap funding (VGF) from the Centre. VGF of up to 40% is available under a central scheme if the project gets approved before March 31, 2026.

            "content": "A new organization, the Progressive Film Makers, is launched in response to the Hema Committee report revealing widespread misconduct in the Malayalam film industry. Kochi: The repercussions of the Justice Hema Committee report, which brought out the ugly side of the Malayalam film world and the untold miseries of the women in it, continue to shake the industry with a group of film personalities on Monday announcing their decision to start a new organisation, as the existing Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) and the Film Employees Federation of Kerala (FEFKA) have come under a cloud. Named the Progressive Film Makers, the new organisation has Aashiq Abu, his actress wife Rima Kallingal, and popular directors Anjali Menon, Lijo Jose Perilassery, and Rajiv Ravi, among others, behind it. Following the Hema Committee report's revelations, several former actresses broke their silence and made allegations of sexual harassment against top figures, including those holding posts in the AMMA and the FEFKA, the apex body of 21 different organisations from light boys to directors, forcing their resignations while both groups also faced flak. The entire 17-member AMMA executive, led by its recently-elected President, superstar Mohanlal, resigned. Abu, in turn, resigned from the FEFKA accusing its General Secretary B.Unnikrishnan of not reacting to the Hema Committee report on time. Following the allegations, 11 FIRs were registered and those now who are facing the music include actor-turned-CPI-M legislator Mukesh Madhavan, Nivin Pauly, Siddique, Jayasurya, Edavela Babu, Maniyanpilla Raju, directors Ranjith and Prakash, and production executives Vichu and Noble. However, Mukesh, Ranjith, Prakash and Raju have, by now, secured relief from the court. With Abu taking the lead in floating a new outfit in the Malayalam film industry, it could see people who are not happy with the AMMA and the FEFKA joining it. Abu and his new team have by now started to reach out to all in the industry with a letter stating the reason why they decided to start a new outfit is to ensure that a new culture is built which will have equality and respectability besides a social objective. The coming days will reveal if Abu and his team are going to be successful as the Kerala High Court has slammed the Pinarayi Vijayan government for sitting on the Hema Committee report for nearly five years and has asked the special investigation team of the Kerala Police to do a clean probe based on the revelations.",

            "description": "The former Union Minister said Haryana\u2019s economy is a \u201ccomplete shambles\u201d; He said farmers will never get justice from the BJP and \u201cthe best way to punish it is by throwing it out of power\u201d",
            "content": "Senior Congress leader and former Union Minister P. Chidambaram on Monday hit out at the BJP government in Haryana, terming its tenure a \u201ctotal failure\u201d that has rendered the State\u2019s economic indicators among the worst in the country. \u201cHaryana is essentially an agricultural State as more than 70% of its population earns its livelihood from this sector. Due to the callous attitude of this government, farmers had to resort to agitations and come on the roads. The BJP regime has been a complete failure,\u201d said Mr. Chidambaram, addressing a press conference in Chandigarh. The leader said the BJP government, instead of addressing farmer\u2019s problems, unleashed repression and violence against them. \u201cMore than 250 FIRs were registered against farmers, some of these were for crimes they never committed. This amply proved that suppression of democratic rights is a character of the BJP and this anti-democratic attitude is the same as that of the Central government. Farmers will never get justice from the BJP and the best way to punish it is by throwing it out of power,\u201d he said. Mr. Chidambaram blamed the BJP government for failing to address unemployment in the State during its decade-long tenure. \u201cHaryana has the worst unemployment figures in the country. As per CMIE data, its unemployment rate is 37.4%. Even the government\u2019s own labour survey report has given the figures of Haryana\u2019s unemployment as 9% as against the national average of 4.1%. This proves that unemployment in Haryana is more than double of the national average. Haryana had 4.5 lakh regular government posts out of which 1.8 lakh are vacant,\u201d he said. The former Minister said Haryana\u2019s economy is in complete shambles. \u201cIt is caught in a debt trap as it is borrowing far more than its known sources of income. Haryana had a total debt of \u20b971,000 crore in the year 2014-15 which has skyrocketed to \u20b93.79 lakh crores in the current fiscal year, a whopping increase of 348%,\u201d he said Responding to questions of rift within the party, Mr. Chidambaram denied that the Haryana Congress was a divided house. \u201cIn every State there are a few leaders who consider themselves front-runners and there is nothing wrong with it as it encourages healthy competition,\u201d he said. Asked if the Congress will announce a Chief Ministerial candidate, the leader said, \u201cCongress usually doesn\u2019t do that. The general process is that after elections, MLAs are asked about their preference and on the basis of that high command takes the final decision.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 08:52 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit A litmus test for the BJP in Haryana Haryana / Haryana Assembly Elections 2024 / Bharatiya Janata Party",

            "content": "VHP and Bajrang Dal activists gather in large numbers on B.C. Road to block the Id procession, near Bantwal, on Monday. The police placed barricades and dispersed the activists.| Photo Credit:SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT Tension prevailed for a while on B.C. Road on Monday, September 16, when a large number of people took part in the annual Id procession, while at the same time, many Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) activists gathered in the town following a voice message in social media which challenged to stop the procession. The voice message circulated earlier went viral in social media. Following a recent statement by VHP\u2019s South Karnataka Joint Secretary Sharan Pumpwell during a public Ganesha festival function in Mangaluru that VHP activists can block procession of Muslims, a voice message reportedly by a former Bantwal Town Municipal Council president Mohammed Sharief challenging the activists to block the Id procession on B.C. Road went viral on social media. The Bantwal Town Police filed a case against Sharief in this connection. In response, activists of VHP and its affiliated units including Bajarang Dal, including Mr. Pumpwell, from across Dakshina Kannada, assembled in large numbers at Rakteshwari Daivastana on B.C. Road. Meanwhile, devout Muslims took out the Id procession from B.C. Road Junction to Mittabail Masjid. When Mr. Pumpwell and other activists began to march from the daivasthana towards B.C. Road junction, the police prevented them by placing barricades. Meanwhile, the Id procession ended at the masjid around noon. As police started to disperse VHP activists, the situation flared up when VHP activists saw some youths moving on two-wheelers and flashing some flags. The police convinced VHP activists to leave the place and brought the situation under control. Earlier, on Sunday, Y. Bharath Shetty, Mangaluru City North MLA, expressed apprehension over the misuse of Id procession for creating unrest and had asked police to ban Id processions. Criticising the conduct of Dr. Shetty, DYFI State president Muneer Katipalla said in a statement on Monday that instead of acting as an MLA and ensuring peaceful conduct of the Id procession, Dr. Shetty turned out as the hater of a community. Dr. Shetty has done little development work, but takes every opportunity to spread hatred between communities and reap political benefit out of it, Mr. Katipalla alleged. Ignoring the campaign against Id procession, people in some other parts near Mangaluru distributed sweets and juice to devout Muslims who took part in the Id procession in places like Mani and Anantady. \u201cThe elected representatives should learn from these villagers. These villagers have given a befitting reply to (Mangaluru City) MLAs and VHP activists,\u201d Mr. Katipalla said.

            "content": "Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) Sirsa candidate Rohtash Jangra on Monday (September 16, 2024) withdrew his nomination papers in support of Haryana Lokhit Party\u2019s (HLP) Gopal Kanda. Later, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) secretary-general Abhay Chautala said that he would reconsider his alliance with the HLP. Haryana is going to polls on October 5 and the vote counting will take place on October 8. Mr. Kanda, who supported the BJP during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, had joined INLD-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance a day after the BJP released its final list of candidates which didn\u2019t feature his name. BJP senior leader Ashok Tanwar, at a press conference, announced that the party\u2019s candidate from Sirsa assembly constituency had withdrawn his papers and extended support to Mr. Kanda. Mr. Tanwar said that the party supported Mr. Kanda as he had supported the BJP during the Lok Sabha polls. On why the party earlier ruled out alliance with the HLP, Mr. Tanwar said that \u201cit was the decision of the high command\u201d. Despite Chief Minister Nayab Saini hinting last month that the BJP would tie up with the HLP, the saffron party in its final list fielded Mr. Jangra from Sirsa. A day later, Mr. Kanda joined the INLD-BSP alliance. However following the BJP\u2019s U-turn on alliance with the HLP, INLD leader Mr. Chautala, at a press conference, said he would speak to Mr. Kanda about this and reconsider his decision to ally with him. \u201cIf the BJP has supported Mr. Kanda and he has accepted their support, we would discuss it to decide on the future course of action,\u201d said Mr. Chautala. Recently a video clip went viral, in which Mr. Kanda told a news channel that the BJP would form government for a third time in Haryana and the INLD-led alliance would support it. On the BJP supporting Mr. Kanda, former Chief Minister and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, at a press conference, said the people of the State already knew this would happen. \u201cINLD-HLP earlier had an indirect alliance with the BJP, but it has now become public,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Haryana, the direct contest is between the Congress and BJP. All other parties like INLD, Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), HLP have been fielded only to split the votes of the Congress. The BJP has given this responsibility to many Independents also. The public needs to be cautious of such candidates,\u201d Mr. Hooda said.

            "content": "The Excise department in Kottayam has once again uncovered a major haul of black money from an interstate bus. According to officials, \u20b967 lakh was seized from two separate locations within the same bus, which was operating from Bengaluru to Erumely on Monday. One individual has been taken into custody in connection with the incident. Of the total amount, \u20b944 lakh was confiscated near Erattupetta, while \u20b923 lakh was found at Ponkunnam. The first seizure occurred in the morning when the Excise team inspected the bus near Erattupetta, while another team intercepted it at Ponkunnam, leading to the second discovery. This follows a similar operation just last week when Excise officials confiscated nearly \u20b91 crore during a search at Thalayolaparambu, resulting in the arrest of a Pathanapuram native. The investigation in that case is currently being handled by the Thalayolaparambu police. Taking a serious note of the development, the district police are intensifying efforts to crack down on the increasing inflow of black money into the region.

            "content": "Citing delay in the progress of trial, the High Court of Karnataka has granted bail to four more accused persons in the Gauri Lankesh murder case. The editor-activist was shot dead at her residence on September 5, 2017. Those who were granted bail are Bharat Jayawant Kurane, 42, Sudhanva Gondhalekar, 43, Sujith Kumar, 42, and Srikanth Pangarkar, 48, who have been arraigned as accused number 6, 9, 13, and 16 respectively in the charge sheet. Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order while allowing separate petitions filed by the four accused while granting them bail on similar grounds of delay in progress of trial on which the four other accused persons (accused number 5,7,11 and 17) were given bail earlier. \u201cUndisputedly, petitioners herein were not present at the spot of crime on the date of incident. Accused number 2 [Parashuram Wagmore] and 3 [Ganesh Maskin] are the alleged assailants of deceased Gauri Lankesh. The allegation against the petitioners is about conspiring with the other accused persons and also facilitating the commission of crime by arranging vehicles, fire arms, etc. Almost similar allegations are found even against accused number 5, 7, 11 and 17, who have been granted regular bail by this court,\u201d the judge observed. Totally 18 persons, who were arraigned as accused in the chargesheet, are facing trial in the case. Also, the court noted that the apex court had on August 20, 2024 dismissed the petitions filed by the State government questioning the High Court\u2019s December 2023 order of granting bail to N. Mohan Nayak (accused number 11) on the ground of delay in progress of the trial. 100 more witnesses The apex court had recorded the statement made on behalf of the State government that \u201c... so far 137 witnesses have been examined by the prosecution, 137 witnesses have been dropped and the prosecution is also likely to drop 150 more witnesses, and now about 100 witnesses are still to be examined.\u201d While noticing that accused Mohan Nayak had cooperated for trial and had not sought adjournment, the apex court had directed the trial court to expedite the case and asked all the parties to cooperate. However, the apex court gave liberty to the prosecution to seek cancellation of his bail if he violated any conditions of the bail or failed to cooperate for further trial and sought unnecessary adjournments.

            "content": "A Bengaluru-based body of pensioners under the Employees\u2019 Pension Scheme (EPS)-1995 of the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has renewed its call for calculating the value of pension wealth under the Scheme on the lines of the National Pension System (NPS) and fixing 8% rate of interest to the Pension Scheme. In a response to an item appeared in FAQ columns on EPFO pensioners on Sunday (September 15) , the ITI Retired Officers Association (IRIROA) stated that even though the EPS was similar to the NPS in terms of being a contributory scheme, the pension amount was being calculated based on \u201cfixed pensionable salary,\u201d and not on the basis of accumulated pension fund that was being followed in respect of the NPS. Giving illustrations, the body pointed out that as per the present EPS-95 Scheme, the maximum pension a retiree would, under normal circumstances, get for 35 years of service was \u20b97,500/- per month or \u20b990,000 per annum. This worked out to 3.06% return on the member\u2019s accumulated pension fund. Similarly, for 25 and 30 years, the monthly pension amounts would be \u20b95,357 (5.14%) and \u20b96,428 (3.98%) respectively. Advocating the determination of 8% rate of return (RoR) on accumulated pension, the pensioners\u2019 body argued that the existing rate of return, expressed as a percentage of pension payable, was \u201cvery much lower\u201d than that of banks. If 8% RoR was taken, the monthly pension would have been \u20b98,329, \u20b912,907 and \u20b919,633 for 25, 30 and 35 years of service respectively. The ITIROA, which made certain suggestions in a representation sent a couple of months ago to the Prime Minister and Union Ministers for Finance and Labour and Employment, also wanted the facility of commutation to be provided to the pension wealth in the event of any exigency for the pensioner.

            "content": "Right from his younger days working in the paddy fields of Arpookara village in Kottayam district with his father, Baiju Thittala had a clear road map in his mind. He wanted to study law, and use it as a stepping stone to politics and become a part of the policy-making process. Though he had to give up that dream for a while, due to the social and economic reasons, he did finally follow that road map to become the Mayor of Cambridge, the first non-white person to occupy that position. Addressing a \u2018meet the press\u2019 event at the Press Club here on Monday, he spoke about his life experiences on the way to become the Mayor. \u201cInitially, I shifted base to Delhi, where I did all kinds of jobs, including the menial ones. When my wife, Ancy, a nurse, migrated to Britain, I went with her. In Britain, I worked as a part-time care assistant and studied politics, history and sociology at the Cambridge Regional College. I then studied law at the Anglia Ruskin University, qualified as a solicitor in 2019 and is now practising as a criminal defence solicitor. All through, I was active in student politics, participating in several protests. In 2007, I became a member of the Labour Party,\u201d said Mr. Thittala. First electoral victory His first electoral victory came in a by-election in 2018 to the East Chesterton seat of the Cambridge City Council. In May 2023, he became a Deputy Mayor, and finally in this May, the Mayor. He has piloted motions to support the Black Lives Matter movement and also made interventions to stop discrimination against non-EU nurses. He said that his politics is aimed at ensuring equality, social justice, and diversity. \u201cFar right movements have been running strong campaigns targeting immigrants, leading to even riot-like situations. But the government has cracked down on them and arrested hundreds of people involved in such activities. Next month, we will organise an event titled \u2018Stand up against racism\u2019 to sensitise the communities and with a stated aim to keep the far right out. In November, we will organise a commemoration event for the fallen soldiers of World War I and II to increase awareness on the number of Indians who lost their lives in these wars. These steps at spreading awareness on real history is an important political duty,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Asian Champions Trophy: India will take on hosts China in Tuesday's final. Skipper Harmanpreet Singh's sublime form resulted in twin strikes as defending champions India entered the final of the Hero Asian Champions Trophy with a clinical 4-1 win against South Korea in the semi-final on Monday. India scored through Uttam Singh (13th minute), skipper Harmanpreet Singh (19th, 45th) and Jarmanpreet Singh (32nd), while Korea's lone goal came from through Yang Jihun (33rd)'s penalty corner conversion. India will take on hosts China in Tuesday's final. Earlier in the day, China defeated Pakistan 2-0 via shoot-out in the first semifinal after the two teams finished 1-1 at the end of regulation 60 minutes. In the previous league stage encounter between the two finalists, India prevailed 3-0. Pakistan and Korea will face off in the third place classification match which will also be played on Tuesday. Meanwhile in the fifth-sixth place classification match, Japan beat Malaysia 4-2 in shoot-out following a 4-4 stalemate in normal time. In the second semifinal as expected, the Indians started on the offensive and tested the Korean defence with persistent attacks from the word go. The Koreans, on the other hand, were contend to sit back and defend and rely on sporadic counter attacks. Abhishek came tantalisingly close to handing India the lead in the fourth minute but his reverse hit was brilliantly saved by Korean goalkeeper Kim Jaehan. The Indian made promising build ups and penetrated the Korean circle on consistent basis in the first quarter. India's attacking intent finally paid of in the 13th minute when Uttam positioned himself at the right place at the right time to tap in Araijeet Singh Hundal's supply from the right. A minute from the first break, Korea secured back-to-back penalty corners but failed to utilise the chances. Four minutes into the second quarter, India secured their first penalty corner and Harmanpreet scored his sixth goal of the tournament to hand his side a 2-0 lead. At the stroke of half-time, custodian Suraj Karkera came out of his line to save an effort from the opposition player. India continued in the same vein after the change of ends and extended their lead two minutes into the third quarter. A brilliant scoop from Sumit from the right finds Jarmanpreet just outside the circle on the left flank and the latter neatly collected the ball and took a step or two to get inside the circle and slap the ball into the Korean goal to extend India's lead. But Korea pulled one back a minute later from a penalty corner through the tournament's top-scorer Yang Jihun. The goal hardly bothered the Indians as they continued their attacking game and dominated the share of exchanges. With a second left for the third quarter, India secured another penalty corner when Korean goalkeeper Jaehan was shown the yellow card for handling the ball out side the circle, and Harmanpreet made no mistake to extend the lead. Eight minutes from the final hooter, India's second goalkeeper Karkera made a fine double save to deny Park Cheoleon, but the Koreans secured a penalty corner which went in vain. Thereafter, it was controlled show from the Indians as they defended their lead with consummate ease to march into their fifth final appearance in the tournament.",

            "content": "The initial meetings between the doctors and the Chief Minister, including one on Saturday, fell through over disagreements about the proceedings being live transmitted or recorded. After two previously unsuccessful attempts, the protesting junior doctors of Kolkata have finally begun talks with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at her Kalighat residence. This is the third meeting, described by the state government as the \"fifth and final invitation for talks.\" Sources have confirmed that unlike the prior occasions, the doctors have entered the meeting space, marking the beginning of formal discussions. Earlier Attempts at Negotiation Failed The initial meetings between the doctors and the Chief Minister, including one on Saturday, fell through over disagreements about the proceedings being live transmitted or recorded. The doctors insisted that the discussions be videographed, with a copy handed to them immediately after the meeting. This led to both sides walking away from negotiations without reaching a consensus. During the first attempt, images circulated online of the Chief Minister sitting alone in a hall at the state secretariat, waiting for the doctors' delegation. These images quickly went viral, highlighting the unresolved tensions. Saturday's meeting fared no better, as arguments persisted outside Mamata Banerjee's Kalighat home. Despite her invitation for them to join her for tea, the doctors refused to enter, standing firm on their demand for live transmission. Banerjee's Attempts to Assure Doctors Go Unanswered In an effort to resolve the dispute, Mamata Banerjee personally assured the protesting doctors that they would be provided with a video recording of the meeting after the conclusion of the Supreme Court proceedings on the matter. Despite this assurance and her repeated invitations for them to enter for tea, the doctors remained adamant, stating their primary goal was not tea but justice. As time passed, the deadlock persisted. Around 9 pm on the day of the second attempt, both parties finally agreed to have a written record of the meeting signed by both sides. However, by then, it was deemed too late to proceed. The evening also saw the arrest of former RG Kar hospital principal Sandip Ghosh and a local police officer by the CBI, related to the ongoing investigation into the alleged evidence tampering following the August 9 rape-murder of a young doctor, which sparked the protests. Doctors Finally Agree To Discussions at Kalighat With the backdrop of these tense events, the protesting doctors eventually agreed to sit down for discussions at Mamata Banerjee's Kalighat residence. The Chief Minister, who had earlier stepped away to continue her work, has now rejoined the efforts to bring an end to the impasse. Both sides are expected to work towards a resolution, with hopes that the ongoing talks will finally bring the protests to a close.",

            "content": "Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday asserted that Narendra Modi-led Central government will bury terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir so deep that it can never rise again. Addressing an election rally in Jammu and Kashmir's Ramban, Shah targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying he and his sister (Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) could play with snow and ride a snowmobile because Jammu and Kashmir became a safe state under the Modi government. The government has made Kashmir safe and that is why today Rahul baba rides a bike in Kashmir and abuses Modi ji while eating ice cream at Lal Chowk, he added. Citing former home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde's statement at that time (UPA governemnt tenure) he was scared of coming to Lal Chowk, Shah called upon Shinde to visit the iconic destination in Srinagar. Shinde saheb, now come with your grand-children, take a walk in Lal Chowk, no one can touch you now, he asserted. At another BJP's rally in in Padder-Nagseni assembly segment of Kishtwar district on the last day of campaigning, Shah said the National Conference-Congress alliance will not be able to form the J-K government. \u201cToday, I promise to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, including this region which has a history of sacrifices following the eruption of terrorism in 1990, that we will bury terrorism to such a deep level that it will never surface again,\u201d the home minister said. He added that attempts are being made to revive and strengthen terrorism like the 1990s. The home minister paid tributes to all those who have been killed in terror-related incidents, and specially referred to the deaths of BJP leaders Anil Parihar, Ajit Parihar and RSS leader Chanderkant Sharma. \u201cNational Conference and Congress have made promises like releasing terrorists from jails after the formation of their government. In front of Maa (Machial Mata\u2019s) shrine, I am saying to you that this is Modi\u2019s government and no one has the courage to spread terrorism on the soil of India,\" he said. Shah said the BJP government has strengthened the village defence guards and Special Police Officers who are being provided modern weapons, replacing the old. 303 rifles with self-loading rifles. \u201cThe security grid being laid is such that any number of people (terrorists) who want to come here from anywhere will face their end in these hills at the hands of our Army and police jawans,\u201d the home minister said. This was the home minister\u2019s second visit to the Jammu region within a fortnight. Earlier, during his two-day visit to Jammu on September 6 and 7, he released BJP\u2019s manifesto for J-K assembly elections and addressed a workers convention. Monday is the last day for campaigning in 24 assembly constituencies, including Padder-Nagseni, which goes to polls in the first phase on September 18. BJP has fielded former minister Sunil Sharma from the constituency for the assembly elections. Seeking support for the BJP candidate, Shah said, \u201cThis election is between two powers, on one side National Conference and PDP and on the other BJP. The NC-Congress are saying that if we form the government we will restore Article 370. Tell me should it be restored?\u201d he asked. \u201cReservation given by BJP to Paharis and Gujjars and others will be snatched,\u201d he said. (With PTI inputs)",

            "content": "J&K Vidhansabha Chunav: A bail to Baramulla MP Er Rashid has given the National Conference a chance to corner the BJP. J&K Polls: With the voting for the Jammu and Kasmir starting on September 18, the political parties have thrown their weight behind the candidates. Star campaigners of all parties have hit the ground in the valley. While the BJP fielded only 19 candidates in the valley out of the total 47 seats, the party is looking to get support from independents and some regional parties as it's confident of winning a majority of the 43 seats in the Jammu region. A bail to Baramulla MP Er Rashid has given the National Conference a chance to corner the BJP. The NC has claimed that Er Rashid's Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) is the 'B' team of the BJP. Meanwhile, the AIP has formed an alliance with the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) for the assembly polls. There are a total of 90 seats in the J&K and the majority mark is 46. The BJP is aware that it might not get a majority on its own and thus, it has its eye on some smaller regional parties and independent candidates as well. There are seven regional parties and 32 independent candidates in the poll fray and have the potential to win the elections. According to a TOI report, the BJP has made it clear that it doesn't have a 'tacit' understanding with the UAPA detainee Er Rashid and his party AIP. The BJP leaders also claimed that the Central government vociferously opposed Rashid's bail. They also made clear that the Union government won't lift the ban from the Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir. The BJP made it clear that it won't ally with the AIP. The Union Home Minister Amit Shah has already promised that the state will get statehood at an appropriate time after the polls. The J&K is heading to polls for the first time since the abrogation of Article 370.",

            "content": "The CBI arrested Mondal on Saturday, September 14, alongside Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, where the incident took place. In the Kolkata doctor rape-murder case, Abhijit Mondal, the officer-in-charge of the Tala police station, was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for allegedly delaying the filing of the First Investigation Report (FIR) by over 14 hours. Despite his arrest, senior officials have praised Mondal for conducting a \"transparent\" investigation into the case. Officer Praised by Senior for 'Transparent' Investigation V Solomon Nesakumar, Additional Commissioner of Kolkata Police, expressed support for Mondal, emphasizing the transparency of his actions during the investigation. Nesakumar stated that the police department stands by Mondal's family and will provide full support during this difficult time. \"Personally, I believe he is not guilty. He acted with good intentions, reached the scene quickly, and conducted a thorough investigation to ensure justice was served,\" Nesakumar told reporters. Arrest Linked to Delay in FIR Filing The CBI arrested Mondal on Saturday, September 14, alongside Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, where the incident took place. Ghosh had already been in custody over alleged financial irregularities at the facility. Both are accused of delaying the FIR in the suspected rape and murder of a trainee doctor, which occurred on August 9 at RG Kar Medical College. Mondal, as the officer-in-charge of Tala police station, is alleged to have delayed registering the FIR in connection with the case, a key point of concern in the CBI's investigation. The case is being investigated under the direction of the Calcutta High Court, which criticized Kolkata Police for its handling of the matter.",

            "content": "On Sriperumbudur Main Road, Amarambedu would roll past without drawing a whisper of discussion \u2014 but for a stone structure. Though derelict, the structure is limited edition. In the Chennai Metropolitan Area, there are not many structures set in this mould that are out there still. The stones had been marshalled into place centuries ago, and the building is robust thumbing its nose at time\u2019s ruthless, impersonal scythe. The crown of weeds it wore on its head and a couple of hay bundles it held in its bowels \u2014 on September 1, 2024 \u2014 suggest that it might not be as cherished as it should be. However, its significance is not lost in the everyday bustle, as proved by a bus stop right on the other side of the road. The stopover takes its name after the village and the chatram \u2014 Amarambedu Chatram stop. In Kundrathur block, Amarambedu panchayat consists of a collection of villages, but the locality has a somnolence that sets back time, the chatram actively engaged in that process. From Amarambedu, the temple town of Kancheepuram is a 42-kilometre roll of the tyres away, and in olden times, this chatram served as a pit stop for pilgrims (to and from the temple town) to rest and recharge their batteries for the walk ahead. A close parallel can be found at Mahabalipuram on East Coast Road, where a chatram stands on the way to the space with the temple complex. Just as at the chatram in Mahabalipuram, the roof at the Amarambedu chatram sports squiggly snakes, one of them gobbling an orb, suggesting the depiction of an eclipse. In addition, there are depictions of fish on the roof. A resident recalls the picturisation of a song in the old Rajnikanth-starrer Manithan at the chatram. In fact, someone, clearly a Rajnikanth fan, has painted an image of the star on a pillar.

            "content": "A Cabinet meeting under the leadership of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah scheduled in Kalaburagi on Tuesday will discuss various key issues, new projects as well as pending projects and prepare a blueprint for comprehensive development of the region, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Priyank Kharge has said. Addressing presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Kharge said that besides new projects and sanctioning funds for approved projects, the Cabinet will take a decision on filling vacant posts in the region. Already, 800 engineers have been recruited in the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department, he added. The Minister said that a proposal has been submitted to the government seeking funds for irrigation projects in Kalaburagi and Bidar districts. Roads across the seven districts of the region will be repaired and upgraded under the Kalyana Patha Scheme in the next two years. Ruling out any compromise in the development of the region, Mr. Kharge said that nearly 2.5 lakh government posts in the State are lying vacant and they will be filled in a phased manner. Responding to a question, Mr. Kharge said that Leader of Opposition in Council Chalavadi Narayanaswami, who staged a protest in Kalaburagi on Monday, should demonstrate against his party MLA Munirathna who has been arrested on the charge of issuing a life threat to a contractor and using castiest slurs against him. Mr. Kharge also sought a clarification from Mr. Narayanaswamy whether he is running a biryani hotel on the land allotted to him for establishing an educational institution. Mr. Kharge said that a fast-track court should be set up to investigate BJP leaders said to be involved in scams and not for the actor Darshan case. Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of maintaining a studied silence on the Nagamangala violence, PoCSO Act cases and the Munirathna case, Mr. Kharge asked why Mr. Modi does not speak about these issues. Minister for Medical Education Sharanprakash Patil said that from 2013 to 2018, nearly 30,000 vacancies (including 13,000 teacher posts) have been filled in the Kalyana Karnataka region. Another 15,000 vacancies will be filled in the next one year and 25,000 posts in the next two years, he added. Liberation Day Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Mr. Siddaramaiah will garland the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in the city and participate in the Kalyana Karnataka Liberation Day celebrations at the District Armed Reserve Police Grounds.

            "content": "Advanced treatments like CAR-T cell therapy and bone marrow transplants are significantly improving outcomes for lymphoma patients, experts highlight during World Lymphoma Awareness Month. New Delhi: Advanced treatments like targeted therapy, CAR-T cell therapy, and Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) are boosting outcomes for patients with Lymphoma, a type of blood cancer that affects the immune system, said experts on Monday. September is celebrated as World Lymphoma awareness month. Lymphoma is considered to be a fairly common cancer in India and develops in white blood cells called lymphocytes. It accounts for approximately 3-4 per cent of all cancers globally and is divided into two main types: Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), with NHL being the more common form. In India, the incidence of lymphoma stands at around 1.8-2.5 cases per 100,000 people annually, with NHL being more prevalent, particularly among older adults. Survival rates for lymphoma have seen significant improvement over the years, with a 5-year survival rate of about 86 per cent for HL and around 72 per cent for NHL. Hodgkins develop majorly in the upper body, like the neck, chest, or armpits, while non-Hodgkins develop in lymph nodes anywhere in the body. \u201cModern treatment methods along with safe and effective treatment options like targeted therapy, CAR-T cell therapy, and BMT have helped improve the clinical outcomes in a big way. Many patients recover successfully after being declared terminal because of the use of innovative modules which proves to be an effective treatment option,\u201d Dr. Ashish Gupta, Medical Oncologist at Unique Hospital Cancer Centre, New Delhi, told IANS. Early detection is particularly important for Hodgkin's Lymphoma, as its cure rate is significantly higher when caught in the early stages. Raising awareness helps individuals recognise key symptoms like swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and fatigue, which are often mistaken for more common illnesses. \u201cImmunotherapy, particularly CAR-T cell therapy, has emerged as a breakthrough for treating certain lymphoma types, especially those resistant to other treatments. Precision medicine, through genetic profiling, allows for personalised treatment strategies, enhancing effectiveness and minimising harm,\u201d Dr. C N Patil, HOD and Lead Consultant - Medical Oncology & Haemato-Oncology, Aster RV Hospital, told IANS. Advancements in technology have significantly transformed lymphoma treatment, making it more effective and reducing side effects. The overall survival rate has increased, with Hodgkin's Lymphoma seeing up to 80-90 per cent cure rates when treated early. Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, which has more subtypes, sees a varied survival rate based on the aggressiveness of the subtype but has improved with newer therapies. Targeted therapies, such as drugs like Rituximab and Brentuximab, specifically attack cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, leading to better patient outcomes. In addition, improvements in radiation therapy have made treatments more focused, reducing damage to healthy surrounding tissues and improving overall patient care.",

            "content": "Nellore Rural MLA Kotamreddy Sridhar Reddy on Monday announced the \u2018Sri Nara Lokesh Aarogya Raksha\u2019 programme which will offer free diagnostic and healthcare services to the underprivileged people of his constituency. Under this programme, medical camps will be organised every Sunday across the constituency up to a period of one year. \u201cInformation Technology and Communication & Industries Minister, Nara Lokesh, son of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, urges the cadre to not only work for the party but also for the welfare of the people. Drawing inspiration from him, I have initiated this programme in his name to provide free medical care to the poor,\u201d Mr. Sridhar Reddy told The Hindu . \u201cMany patients are dying due to the delay in diagnosis, unable to recognise their illnesses in advance. They are deprived of medical tests due to the cost burden, thus neglecting the disease until it reaches the final stages. We have started this programme with an aim of saving their lives,\u201d he informed. Telugu Desam Party (TDP) youth leader Datla Chakradhar Reddy was made the convener of the programme, which will commence from September 22 at Devarapalem village.

In a mega upset, China stunned Pakistan 2-0 in the shootout on Monday to enter the Final of the Asian Champions Trophy here at the Moqi Hockey Training Base in China. It is the first time in the history of the tournament that the Chinese national team has made it to the final. While the second-highest number of title winners Pakistan will play for the Bronze medal against the loser of the second semifinal between India and Korea. The Chinese goalkeeper Caiyu Wang was outstanding in his efforts to keep a clean slate in the shootout, while, Benhai Chen and Chanliang Lin scored for China. Earlier in the match, Yuanlin Lu had given China an early 1-0 lead in the 18th minute. The first semifinal of the day truly lived up to its billing, with China posing a mega threat to Pakistan's hopes of making the final right from the start. They were gritty in their pursuit, dominated the ball possession, and created early chances. (How Earrings Worth Rs 1 Lakh Caused Ruckus Between Cristiano Ronaldo And Erik Ten Hag At Manchester United) The 1-0 lead for China put Pakistan on the backfoot. China also came up with brilliant defence in the second quarter to stop Pakistan from scoring a Penalty Corner (PC).

They punctured Pakistan's attack and kept the pressure on through tactful defending. Though Pakistan mustered a goal in the 37th minute through Ahmed Nadeem, China ensured they didn't concede another goal. They played a disciplined game, tackled Pakistani attackers with strong man-to-man marking to ensure they didn't create scoring opportunities. Though Pakistan made a handful of circle entries in the following minutes in the third and the fourth quarter, China restricted their shots on goal quite effectively to keep the scoreline at 1-1 stalemate.",

            "content": "A 47-year-old woman\u2019s death in a hit-and-run accident at Sasthamcotta in Kollam district on Monday has triggered a public outcry. The police identified the deceased as Kunju Mol. She was riding pillion when a car rammed the two-wheeler from behind. The vehicle ran over the woman, who fell on the road in the impact of the collision. It then sped away from the scene, prompting a major search for the vehicle and driver. Ms. Kunju Mol\u2019s relative, Fousiya, who was driving the two-wheeler, escaped with minor injuries. Later, the police arrested Ajmal, 27, and his co-passenger, a woman doctor, in connection with the incident. The Kollam police, quoting a blood alcohol test report, alleged that Mr. Ajmal drove the car when he was alcohol-impaired. They said the co-passenger also tested positive in the test, which government doctors conducted at the police\u2019s behest. Grainy surveillance camera footage of the frightful accident went viral on conventional and social media, raising questions about the safety of two-wheeler riders and pedestrians on the State\u2019s busy roads. Public give chase The police said Mr. Ajmal drove away from the spot, fearing public anger. Some passersby tried to stop the car, while a few others gave chase on motorcycles. Mr. Ajmal succeeded in throwing his pursuers off the scent but was later tracked and arrested by the police. The police said the accident occurred after Mr. Ajmal and his co-passenger left a friend\u2019s party. They have registered a case under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 281 (rash and negligent driving), 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 125 (a) (Rash or careless acts that put human life or personal safety at risk), 125 (b) (grievous hurt) and relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act. Service terminated Meanwhile, a private hospital which employed the doctor terminated her service on the charge of breaching medical ethics for fleeing the spot without attending to the accident victim. The State Human Rights Commission have taken suo motu cognisance of the offence and ordered the registration of a case. It sought a report from the police, the Motor Vehicles department, and the district administration.

            "description": "He alleges that the NDA government is rolling back key educational reforms initiated by YSRCP aimed at providing quality education to the underprivileged",
            "content": "The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) president and former Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has urged Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to immediately stop actions that weaken government schools, emphasising the importance of education as a tool to permanently eradicate poverty. Taking to the social media platform X on Monday, Mr. Jagan criticised the government for rolling back key educational reforms aimed at providing quality education to the underprivileged. The State government was taking regressive steps by cancelling the CBSE syllabus in government schools, thereby undermining the quality of education for economically poor students. There is a clear contradiction in the TDP\u2019s approach. While they ensure the best education for children in private schools, they neglect the educational needs of children in government schools. Do the TDP intend to keep government school students at a lower level permanently? he asked. The YSRCP government had introduced a series of reforms to transform the State government schools, including initiatives like \u2018Nadu-Nedu,\u2019 the introduction of English medium, CBSE affiliation, and the incorporation of interactive learning methods. These reforms aimed at elevating the standard of education and provide government school students with opportunities comparable to those in private institutions. However, the TDP-led coalition government was systematically undoing these efforts, in a deliberate attempt to push government school students towards private institutions owned by TDP leaders, he alleged. Mr. Jagan alleged that depriving government schoolchildren of access to world-class education would only harm the future of these students. The former Chief Minister defended government school teachers, stating that they are highly qualified, having passed competitive exams and received extensive training. The TDP government, however, was demoralising them. The government needs to recognise their capabilities and contributions to the education sector, he said.

            "content": "The rupee witnessed range-bound trade and settled for the day higher by 4 paise at 83.88 (provisional) against the U.S. dollar on Monday (September 16, 2024) supported by weak American currency and significant foreign fund inflows, while firm crude oil prices capped sharp gains. Forex traders said market participants are eagerly awaiting cues from the U.S. Fed policy on Wednesday (September 11, 2024), with a rate cut all but certain. However, the magnitude of the cut remains uncertain. Moreover, the rupee continues to hold steady within a well-defined range on active intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), they added. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.89 and witnessed an intraday high of 83.87 and a low of 83.90 against the American currency. The domestic unit finally settled for the day at 83.88 (provisional), higher by 4 paise over its previous close, amid a positive trend in domestic equities. On Friday (September 13, 2024), the local unit settled higher by 4 paise at 83.92 against the U.S. dollar. \"We expect the Indian rupee to trade with a slight positive bias on continued weakness in the U.S. dollar ahead of the FOMC meeting this week,\" said Anuj Choudhary \u2013 Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. Choudhary further said that \"there are broad expectations of a 25 bps rate cut by the Fed following a 25 bps rate cut by ECB last week. Fresh foreign inflows and a positive tone in equity markets may further support the domestic currency. However, a recovery in crude oil prices may cap sharp upside.\" Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was down 0.39% to 100.72 points. Brent crude, the international benchmark, gained 0.56% to USD 72.01 per barrel in futures trade. In the domestic equity market, the 30-share BSE Sensex advanced 97.84 points, or 0.12%, to close at 82,988.78 points, while the Nifty rose 27.25 points, or 0.11%, to 25,383.75 points. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital markets on Friday (September 13, 2024), as they purchased shares worth \u20b92,364.82 crore, according to exchange data. Meanwhile, India's forex reserves jumped USD 5.248 billion to a new all-time high of USD 689.235 billion for the week ended September 6, the Reserve Bank of India said on Friday (September 13, 2024). The overall kitty had jumped by USD 2.299 billion to a record USD 683.987 billion for the previous reporting week.

Anvar\u2019s \u201cadmission\u201d that the latter had tapped telephones, including those used by police officers. Mr. Muraleedharan also sought an investigation into Mr. Anvar\u2019s accusation that a top police officer had ordered illegal wiretaps on Ministers, political leaders, including Opposition figures and journalists. Mr. Muraleedharan asked the administration to clarify whether it had ordered the wiretap or was aware of the eavesdropping operation. Mr. Muraleedharan said phone tapping required a Home department sanction. Illegal wiretaps were an infringement on privacy, unconstitutional and a violation of civil rights. His demand came close on the heels of Kerala Governor Arif Muhammad Khan\u2019s request to report on the wiretapping allegations.

New Delhi: Covid seems to be rising again with a new and more contagious variant -- XEC -- spreading rapidly across 15 countries. First detected in Germany in June, XEC is a combination of the KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 variants. According to reports, it has already overtaken the previously dominant FliRT strain of the deadly virus. The strain, belonging to the Omicron variant, is currently spreading \"quite rapidly\" across Europe, North America and Asia. About 550 samples have now been reported, from 27 countries, including Poland, Norway, Luxembourg, Ukraine, Portugal, the US and China have now reported samples. \"At this juncture, the XEC variant appears to be the most likely one to get legs next,\" Eric Topol, Director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, US, said in a recent post on X. As per experts, XEC comes with some new mutations that might help it spread this autumn. However, vaccines may help prevent severe cases. In a post on X, a Melbourne-based data expert Mike Honey stated that XEC strain is \"a likely next challenger to the currently dominant variants\". Honey noted that XEC has already charged ahead of other variants like the FLiRT, FLuQU and DEFLuQE strains. The strain reportedly causes symptoms that are similar to those experienced with common illnesses such as influenza and colds. While most people will get better within a few weeks, for some it may take longer to recover and some may even require hospitalisation. According to the UK NHS, the variant causes flu-like symptoms which includes a high temperature or shivering (chills), a new, continuous cough, a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste, shortness of breath, fatigue, body ache, loss of appetite, among others.",

            "content": "Folktales are a story-telling tradition that have been handed down from generation to generation and are not necessarily true. A long time ago, a rich man and a poor man had a field in common. They always sowed it with the same seed at the same time of the year. One year, as was their practice, the rich man and the poor man sowed their field with the same seed. However, God prospered the poor man\u2019s hard work and made the seed grow. The rich man was surprised to find that his seeds had not sprouted. A quarrel Angry, he shouted at the poor man saying, \u201cLook, my seed has prospered and not yours.\u201d The poor man was shocked and protested feebly, \u201cOh no! It is my seed that has grown.\u201d The rich man was adamant. \u201cThis is my seed that has sprouted.\u201d The more the poor man protested, the more the rich man was adamant. Finally, he said, \u201cIf you do not believe me, then let us find out tomorrow. Come to this field at the crack of dawn and we will ask God to be our judge.\u201d The poor man could only agree. Trickery That night, the rich man dug a deep trench in the poor man\u2019s portion of the field and told his son to hide in the ground. \u201cTomorrow morning, when I come here and ask aloud \u2018Whose field is this\u2019, you must say it is mine,\u201d He said. The son willingly agreed. The rich man covered his son with straw and went home. Early the next morning, many people from the village gathered at the field to witness God\u2019s decision. The rich man went close to the hole in which he had buried his son and said, \u201cOh God, please find a solution to our dilemma. Please let us who this land belongs to.\u201d Immediately, the son shouted from his hiding place, \u201cIt is the rich man\u2019s land. Indeed, it is the rich man\u2019s land.\u201d Justice served But, unknown to the rich man and his son, God himself was in the crowd of people who had gathered. Angry with the unjust behaviour of the rich man and his son God said, \u201cDo not listen to that voice. That is the rich man\u2019s son whom he has buried in the ground. I tell you, this is the poor man\u2019s land.\u201d All the people there were surprised. They were astounded by the callousness of the rich man. Then God said to the rich man, \u201cAs a punishment, your son will stay beneath the earth all the days of his life, as long as the sun is in the sky.\u201d The rich man\u2019s son was transformed into a mole and spent the rest of his life below the earth\u2019s surface, fleeing with the rising of the sun. Ever since, moles are known to hide from the sun. Published - September 16, 2024 07:29 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Young World",

            "content": "HYDERABAD The Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) has alleged that it is only to appease AICC leader Sonia Gandhi that the Congress government in the State has installed the statue of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who has no connection with the Statehood of Telangana, in front of the Secretariat building. Stating that the previous BRS government had planned to install a \u2018Telangana Thalli\u2019 statue at the site as part of a plaza comprising a police station, food courts and a bus stop, BRS leaders V. Prashanth Reddy, Soma Bharath Kumar and others said Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy had got the Rajiv Gandhi statue installed there to please the Delhi bosses of the Congress and to mortgage the self respect of Telangana people in Delhi. The designs of the plaza planned there along with the Telangana Thalli statue were prepared in June 2023 but the Assembly elections had prevented the then government from taking up the work. Further, they alleged that the State government was resorting to such tactics to divert the dissatisfaction among people about the implementation of pre-poll promises. It was with a view to keep the sacrifices of Telangana martyrs afresh always that the previous government had got the \u2018Amara Jyothi\u2019 structure/memorial constructed in a size that was larger than the Chicago Bean structure, but the Congress government was not opening it for public as part of a conspiracy to discontinue all the good work done by the K. Chandrasekhar Rao government. However, Mr. Revanth Reddy was making use of the Command Control Centre and Secretariat buildings. Similarly, the Congress government was also not allowing people to the 125 feet tall B.R. Ambedkar statue, the BRS leaders said. \u2018Will move RG statue\u2019 Meanwhile, the BRS has given a call to cleanse the Telangana Thalli statues across the State on Tuesday to protest the installation of Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s statue in front of the Secretariat building against the plans to install a Telangana Thalli statue there. In a statement, working president of the party K.T. Rama Rao has strongly objected to the installation of Rajiv Gandhi statue at the site earmarked for Telangana Thalli statue. He reiterated that the Rajiv Gandhi statue would be shifted to Gandhi Bhavan, once the BRS was voted back to power.

Mr. Yadav launched a broadside at Mr. Modi while speaking to the media during his ongoing yatra in Muzaffarpur. He said, \u201cHe [Mr. Modi] has nothing else to talk about these days. Has he visited Manipur yet? He has made ministers of rapists from his party. Has any action been taken against them? The Prime Minister is the biggest enemy of Bihar and is meting out a stepmotherly treatment to the State. He neither gave special category status to Bihar nor a special package.\u201d The RJD leader further said, \u201cThe Centre has said no to the special category status demand of Bihar. When election comes, the BJP leaders say yes [to the demand] to gain votes. After the elections, they say no. In the 11 years of his government, the PM has pushed Bihar to the abyss. If you check the NITI Aayog\u2019s report, you will find that Bihar\u2019s performance is the worst, with maximum poverty, and migration of around 2.9 crore people. Bihar has the lowest Per Capita Income. Will the PM say anything on these issues? It is the BJP which ruled Jharkhand for the longest period. Then who is the enemy of development? The PM should first do research before speaking on any issue instead of just reading from the teleprompter.\u201d Training his guns at the BJP-JD(U) coalition government in Bihar, Mr. Yadav said the double engine government did nothing about the prevailing public issues but was busy talking about Hindu, Muslims, Mandir, Masjid, Pakistan, Kashmir and Bangladesh. The former Deputy Chief Minister said that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had become deaf, dumb and blind to the issue of rising crimes in the State. He also accused Mr. Kumar of \u2018snooping\u2019 on him during the yatra in Darbhanga. \u201cI really don\u2019t know why the government is so afraid of my yatra. In Darbhanga, we found people from CID and Special Branch sitting in the workers\u2019 meeting. It was a closed-door meeting in which even the press was not allowed. However, our workers pointed out that two people in the gathering were neither from the press nor party workers. They were clicking the photographs. After a while, we came to know that they were people from the CID and Special Branch. I wish the government instead spied on criminals and corrupt people,\u201d Mr. Yadav said.

            "content": "Passengers are put to hardship as some of the city buses continue to skip the second entry road leading to the Junction Railway Station in Tiruchi. The second entry road abutting Bharathiar Salai to Junction was laid to ensure the free flow of vehicular movement and ease congestion in front of the station\u2019s main entrance. City buses bound for the central bus stand are supposed to turn left from Bharathiar Salai to enter the second entrance road. After dropping passengers at the second entry road, buses take a U-turn to enter Bharathiar Salai again before proceeding to the bus stand. However, some buses skip the route, especially during peak hours, and continue on the Bharathiar Salai to reach the bus stand. They stop near the roundabout in front of the station to drop commuters. Heavy movement of vehicles at the Junction roundabout adds to the traffic woes. During peak hours, the commuters waiting at the railway station bus stop have to wait long to board a city bus. \u201cSome buses enter the road only if they have to drop a commuter at the railway station bus stop. The practice of not halting at the stop is frequent, and we are forced to wait longer or hire autorickshaws, which become expensive at times,\u201d said T. Selvam, a regular commuter. Besides causing inconvenience, reckless driving by private city buses is a threat to road users accessing Bharathiar Salai, especially near the roundabout, commuters added. Despite placing barricades near the entry road to caution and redirect buses to the road, some city buses continue to skip the stop. Police personnel have also been deployed at the entry point of the road to check violations. A senior police official said that they would ensure that buses were directed to go via the railway junction bus stop.

            "description": "State government says the figures, which were submitted to the Kerala High Court in a suo motu petition initiated by the Division Bench, are not the money spent on the ground but part of the memorandum submitted to the Union government for securing Central aid",
            "content": "The cost estimation of the response and relief measures following the Wayanad tragedy has run into a controversy with the BJP and the IUML alleging that the government claimed to spend huge amounts for relief measures which the volunteers had undertaken free of cost. However, the State government was quick to respond that the figures, which were submitted to the Kerala High Court in a suo motu petition initiated by the Division Bench, were not the money spent on the ground but part of the memorandum submitted to the Union government for securing Central aid. The estimate, which was prepared by following the National Disaster Response Fund norms, had also covered the anticipated and possible escalation in the costs, according the government. Incidentally, some sections of the media had reported that the government had claimed to have incurred an expense of \u20b92.76 crore for burying 359 bodies at the rate of \u20b975,000 a body. The other expenses in the memorandum included \u20b910 crore for food and water supply for volunteers and troops, \u20b91 crore for the construction of Bailey bridge and allied works and \u20b915 crore for accommodation for volunteers and troops. It had also estimated \u20b917 crore as the expense for the aircraft of the Indian Air Force used for transporting troops, air-lifting of survivors and dead bodies and VIP movement. BJP State President K. Surendran accused the State government of engaging in mindless exploitation and corruption under the cover of the disaster. Though the volunteers laid to rest the victims without claiming any remuneration, the government claimed to have incurred \u20b975,000 per dead body, he alleged. In his social media post, Indian Union Muslim League leader P.K. Kunjalikutty said the government had insulted hundreds of volunteers who carried out the relief and rescue works. He demanded transparency in the financial transactions. In a communication, the office of the Chief Minister stated that a section of the media was wrongly portraying the estimation in the memorandum, which was prepared by following the National Disaster Response Fund norms and submitted to the union government as the actual expenses incurred by the government. The deliberate and wrong depiction of the details of the memorandum was part of the efforts to torpedo the efforts of the State government to obtain maximum Central aid and to provide adequate assistance to the victims, the statement said.

            "content": "In a bid to rejuvenate tourism in Wayanad following the devastating landslides at Chooralmala, over two dozen social media influencers will gather in the district on September 17 (Tuesday). The initiative marks a crucial phase in Kerala Tourism\u2019s promotional campaign titled \u2018My Kerala, Beautiful As Ever\u2019, designed to attract holidaymakers from around the globe. Tourism and Public Works Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas will inaugurate the campaign by unveiling the official video and engaging in discussions with the influencers at Mananthavady at 5 p.m. on Tuesday. Approximately 30 influential content creators, recognised for their substantial online following, will explore Wayanad\u2019s scenic spots to document their experiences, showcasing the region\u2019s enduring beauty amid the adversity. The hospitality sector faced a massive wave of booking cancellations following the tragedy, driven by a flood of negative narratives on social media platforms. \u201cThe tourism sector suffered severely as many labelled the incident as the Wayanad disaster, despite it being confined to a limited area,\u201d said Mr. Riyas. The Minister said the negative perception led to widespread cancellations, impacting the livelihoods of numerous families within the tourism-dependent community. Mr. Riyas said the government had devised a comprehensive plan aimed at reviving Wayanad\u2019s tourism sector, which had seen a resurgence in visitor numbers since the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government took charge. Before the landslides, Wayanad had emerged as a premier destination, with many resorts experiencing full bookings over weekends, underscoring its popularity. Wayanad was the inaugural location for the Safe Kerala initiative launched after the COVID-19 pandemic, but the recent events have overshadowed those efforts. Mr. Riyas expressed optimism that the \u2018My Kerala, Beautiful As Ever\u2019 campaign would reinvigorate tourism across the State. \u201cThis event is part of a broader series of strategic initiatives planned by the Department of Tourism to attract visitors to God\u2019s own country,\u201d he said.

According to sources, T. Tamilselvam, 31, a policeman attached to Thalavai police station and Venkatesan, 42, a home guard, spotted the minitruck on Annasinallur-Anganur road. Suspecting that it was transporting sand, they signalled the driver to stop the vehicle. However, it was said that the vehicle did not stop, forcing them to chase it on a two-wheeler. During the chase, the minitruck reportedly hit the handle of the two-wheeler and sped away. While Mr. Tamilselvan suffered injuries on his hands, Mr. Venkatesan sustained injuries on his legs. Both of them were rushed to the Government Medical College Hospital in Ariyalur. The Thalavai police have registered a case and are investigating. Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur, Selvaraj visited the injured at the hospital and enquired about the incident.

Elambahavath on Monday. The petitioners said the Ayyanadaippu village panchayat had a sizable Scheduled Caste population working as farmhands and under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. If the panchayat was merged with the Corporation, welfare schemes such as MGNREGA and free housing would be snatched away, while there would be manifold increase in taxes payable to the Corporation such as property tax, vacant land tax, drinking water tax and professional tax . Since the poor residents of Ayyanadaippu village panchayat could not afford to pay the increased taxes, while losing their job under the MGNREGA scheme, the move to annex the rural local body with the Corporation should be given up, they prayed. The petitioners said the Corporation, which had annexed the peripheral areas up to Muthaiahpuram in the south, was planning to extend its boundaries in the west up to Korampallam and Ayyanadaippu so that the Collectorate campus and the manufacturing units in SIPCOT Industrial Estate would also be part of the urban civic body. Mr. Elambahavath received 420 petitions on Monday and handed over two hand-pedalled tricycles and a wheelchair. He also received 26 petitions from differently abled persons.

            "content": ": The State government has cancelled the Reverse Tendering process introduced by the previous government headed by the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) in August 2020. It issued GO 40 to this effect on Sunday (September 15), reverting to the conventional tendering process that existed prior to 2020. In the GO, Special Chief Secretary, Water Resources Department, G. Sai Prasad said that the Chairman of the Board of Chief Engineers (BoCEs) and the Engineer-in-Chief (Administration Wing/ Irrigation Wing), Water Resources Department, had recommended the government to restore the status quo ante in place of the existing reverse tendering process. The existing online e-procurement system, which was earlier revamped to suit the reverse tendering process, would be revived/restored to suit the earlier tendering process for the entrustment of works in all government departments and corporations, he said. During the implementation of the reverse tendering process, certain drawbacks were observed and thus the Board of Chief Engineers was asked to review the same and submit their recommendations. The government, after careful examination of the matter and based on the recommendations of the Board of Chief Engineers, cancelled the orders issued regarding the reverse tendering process vide GO Ms. No.67, Water Resources (Reforms) Department, dated August 16, 2019. The government departments and corporations were instructed to implement the conventional tender process for entrustment of works, he added. The State Cabinet, in its meeting held on August 28 this year, decided to cancel the revere tendering process introduced by the previous YSRCP government citing \u201cbreach of secrecy.\u201d The government said it was decided to reintroduce the old tendering policy for all the departments, and that the government would follow the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) guidelines in this regard.

            "content": "The first council meeting of the Namakkal Corporation was held on Monday. Mayor D. Kalanithi presided over the meeting. A total of 91 resolutions were passed in the meeting, including a resolution thanking the State government for upgrading the Namakkal Municipality as a Corporation. Rajya Sabha member K.R.N. Rajeshkumar handed over Sengol to the Mayor. Councillor of Ward 36 P. Vijay Anand said that the stray dog menace had increased in the Corporation limits and in his ward, the dogs pose a threat to the school-going students. Highlighting the same issue, Ward 5 councillor N. Krishnamoorthy said due to the functioning of chilli chicken centres and meat shops, roaming of dogs had increased in his ward. Recently, a motorist, who sustained injuries after a dog chased his bike, died. So, the Corporation should take steps to prevent the stray dog menace, he added. Ward 34 councillor V. Ilamparuthi said that as per government norms, no toll plazas should be located in 10-km radius of Corporation limits. But, Keerambur toll plaza was situated within 2-km radius of the Corporation and the civic body should take up the issue with the concerned departments. Replying to this, Corporation Commissioner R. Maheswari said that a letter was sent to the government regarding the toll plaza. Ward 9 councillor Nandhakumar said that as the weekly shandy was functioning near the Corporation office on Tiruchengode Road, there was heavy traffic congestion and to prevent accidents, speed-breakers should be installed. Nine panchayats were annexed with Namakkal Municipality 10 years ago. For these places, 23,000 drinking water connections were given and the people had paid deposits. But, drinking water was not being supplied regularly. Besides, the road dug up for pipeline-laying works had also not been re-laid properly. Ward 10 councillor T.T. Saravanan demanded reduction in deposit amount increased for underground drainage and also reduction in drinking water charges.

            "content": "NPS 'Vatsalya' offers flexible contributions and investment options, allowing parents to make an investment of Rs 1,000 annually in the name of the child, thus making it accessible to families from all economic backgrounds. New Delhi: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to introduce the New Pension Scheme (NPS) 'Vatsalya' for children in New Delhi on September 18. The new pension scheme announced in the Union Budget 2024 which allows parents to contribute to their children's NPS accounts, helping them build a retirement fund and secure their financial future. According to Ministry of Finance, the NPS Vatsalya events will be held simultaneously at around 75 locations across the country during the launch. However, these locations will connect via video conference, where PRAN (Permanent Retirement Account Number) membership cards will also be distributed to new minor subscribers. FM Sitharaman will also unveil an online platform for subscribing to NPS Vatsalya, release a scheme brochure, and distribute PRAN cards to new minor subscribers. The scheme allows children to withdraw a portion of the accumulated corpus as a lump sum and receive the rest as regular pension payments. \u201cNPS 'Vatsalya' will allow parents to save for their children\u2019s future by investing in a pension account and ensure long-term wealth with the power of compounding,\u201d said the ministry. It is important to note that upon reaching adulthood, the child's account will convert into a regular NPS account. Parents can start with a modest monthly contribution of Rs 500 or an annual contribution of Rs 6,000. Under the NPS Vatsalya Scheme, parents are allowed to invest Rs 1,000 annually in the name of their child, making it accessible to families from all economic backgrounds. NPS Vatsalya To Secure the Financial Future Of Children This new initiative is designed to start early in securing the financial future of children, marking an important step in India\u2019s pension system. The scheme will be run under the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). \u201cThe launch of NPS Vatsalya highlights the government of India's commitment to promote long-term financial planning and security for all,\u201d said the ministry.

            "description": "about 95% of the work on two packages of the project \u2014 Thanjavur to Cholapuram and Cholapuram to Sethiyathope \u2014 completed and fresh tenders are to be floated, says Minister",
            "content": "Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari\u2019s inspection of the progress of the long-delayed Vikravandi-Kumbakonam-Thanjavur national highway development last week has raised hopes that the project would finally get a much-needed push. The project is widely considered to be an important infrastructure development for the delta region. The Minister observed that it was an important corridor for the development of Villupuram, Cuddalore, Ariyalur, Tiruvarur, and Thanjavur districts. The project, he conceded, had run into a long delay as it was scheduled to have been completed by September 2020. The whole project, he said, was delayed because of various factors, including Cyclone Gaja, the COVID-19 pandemic, and delay in land acquisition. According to the Minister, about 95% of the work on two packages of the project \u2014 Thanjavur to Cholapuram and Cholapuram to Sethiyathope \u2014 have been completed. The NHAI had decided to terminate the contract of the other package and go for fresh tender. The work would be started as soon as possible, he said. The Minister\u2019s inspection and his assurances on the project has raised hopes among Kumbakonam residents. \u201cThe project had been moving at a snail\u2019s pace. The Minister\u2019s personal inspection of the project has raised big hopes among us. We wish the highway section between Cholapuram and Thanjavur would be fully completed and opened for traffic soon. We hope that the other package too would be executed expeditiously following the Minister\u2019s visit,\u201d said A. Giri, a resident of Kumbakonam. The four-lane Cholapuram-Thanjavur section runs for 48 km and includes two bypass sections, four major bridges and 15 vehicular underpasses/flyovers. The Sethiyathope-Cholapuram section runs for a distance of about 50 km and includes three bypasses, four major bridges and 20 VUPs/flyovers. Emphasising the need for expediting the construction of the Vikravandi-Sethiyathope section, V. Sathiyanarayanan, Secretary, All Traders Associations of Kumbakonam, said this was a vital section for commerce and tourism as it connected important places such as Neyveli, Kumbakonam, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur. Pointing out that the next mahamaham festival is scheduled for 2028, he said it was essential that the project was executed on a war footing. \u201cThe development of the highway section has been going on for several years. The delay in the project has resulted in increased travel time, traffic congestion, and accidents,\u201d Mr. Sathiyanarayanan said in a representation addressed to the Minister. He urged the Minister to upgrade the Kumbakonam-T. Palur-Jayamkondam-Vridhachalam-Ulundurpet State highway as a national highway and connect it to the Golden Quadrilateral.

            "content": "Equity benchmark index Sensex rebounded nearly 100 points to hit a lifetime closing high on Monday (September 16, 2024), while the broader Nifty ended just shy of its record peak, propelled by bargain hunting in energy, utility and banking stocks amid sustained foreign fund inflows. The 30-share BSE Sensex climbed 97.84 points or 0.12% to settle at a new record peak of 82,988.78. During the day, it jumped 293.4 points or 0.35% to hit a fresh lifetime intra-day high of 83,184.34. The NSE Nifty rose 27.25 points or 0.11% to settle at 25,383.75, over 5 points lower than its previous record. During the day, the benchmark gained 89.2 points or 0.35% to hit a new intra-day high of 25,445.70. \u201cThe domestic market traded in a narrow range with a positive bias as the participants are keenly awaiting the Fed\u2019s decision this week. The weakness in the U.S. job market and benign inflation are pointing at a slew of rate cuts on the table. \u201cThe inflow of foreign money and an expectation of stability in domestic growth may keep sentiment optimistic,\u201d Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said. NTPC was the biggest gainer on the Sensex chart, rising 2.44%, followed by JSW Steel, Larsen & Toubro, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Nestle, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Steel. Bajaj Finance declined over 3%. Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finserv, Adani Port and Asian Paints were the other laggards. \u201cThe Indian markets continued their bullish trend, with Nifty reaching a new record high, driven primarily by foreign institutional investor (FII) buying and a strong market breadth. \u201cInvestors remain cautiously optimistic ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting later this week, which could influence short-term trends. Investors are advised to stay aligned with the current trend but watch for potential market reactions to the U.S. Fed\u2019s policy announcements,\u201d Vikram Kasat, Head - Advisory, PL Capital - Prabhudas Lilladher, said. In the broader market, the BSE smallcap gauge climbed 0.28% while the midcap index ended marginally up by 0.01%. Among the indices, utilities jumped 1.97%, power (1.93%), metal (0.65%), capital goods (0.56%), consumer durables (0.49%) and industrials (0.33%). IT, telecommunication, tech, services and FMCG were the laggards. In Asian markets, Hong Kong ended with gains. Markets in Japan, mainland China and South Korea were closed for holidays. European markets were trading mostly higher. The U.S. markets ended in positive territory on Friday (September 13, 2024). Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought equities worth \u20b92,364.82 crore on Friday, according to exchange data. Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) also bought equities worth \u20b92,532.18 crore. Global oil benchmark Brent crude climbed 0.35% to USD 71.90 a barrel. \u201cGlobally equity markets will be focused on the Fed rate action on Wednesday, which is likely to influence the stock market trend in the near-term,\u201d said V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. On Friday (September 13, 2024), the BSE benchmark Sensex fell by 71.77 points or 0.09% to settle at 82,890.94.

            "content": "The Laghu Udyog Bharat - Tamil Nadu (LUB-TN), an organisation espousing the cause of Micro and Small Industries, has called upon the Railway Ministry to fulfil specific infrastrutural requirements and services in Coimbatore and other western districts that would potential double revenue from the region to over \u20b91,400 crore. A delegation of LUB-TN recently called upon Ashwini Vaishnaw, Railway Minister, in New Delhi and submitted a memorandum containing a list of demands. In the financial year 2023-24, Coimbatore generated a total revenue of approximately \u20b9650 crore, with \u20b9350 crore from passenger services and \u20b9300 crore from freight operations, the memorandum said. Coimbatore played a pivotal role in the Southern Railways network. With 150 train services, the Coimbatore region contributed significantly to railway revenues, accounting for the third highest revenue in Southern Railways and 45% of Salem division\u2019s, the organisation pointed out. In the area of Station Infrastructure, the organisation sought redevelopment of Coimbatore Junction at the earliest under EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) mode; and expansion of Coimbatore North Junction with construction of two additional platforms with entry from Mettupalayam Road, alongside the development of passenger amenities and train originating/ terminating facilities. The current goods depot should be relocated to Peelamedu or Irugur due to its central city location, the memorandum said. The LUB called for enhancements at Irugur Junction by way of increasing platform length and height, a foot overbridge and improved lighting and toilet facilities. On creation of facilities for train maintenance, the LUB drew the attention of the Minister to the long-pending proposals for establishing additional pit lines, stabling lines, and coaching facilities; and sought implementation of a state-of-the-art signalling system and the installation of Kavach in Coimbatore. In the area of train services, the organisation requested for introduction of a Vande Bharat train service from Coimbatore to Tiruvananthapuram via Ernakulam; introduction of new superfast services and restoration of metre gauge services from Coimbatore to Patna, Kolkata, Thiruchendur, and Sengottai; besides increasing frequency of the services to Delhi (Kongu Express), Jabalpur, Rameswaram (via Trichy), Tirunelveli (via Palani), and a circular train service around Coimbatore city using existing infrastructure and creating new halt stations at locations such as Airport, Tidel Park, Nanjundapuram, Singanallur, and Ondipudur. The LUB-TN underscored the scope for scaling up cargo business through establishment of a new cargo terminal on the vacant land available at Nallampalayam, north of Coimbatore city; enhancing facilities for loading and unloading with the provision of cranes and forklifts; relocation of Goods Shed from Coimbatore North and Peelamedu to the new Multi-Modal Logistics Park in the Irugur area; and early completion of the third and fourth lines between Jolarpettai, Coimbatore, and Shoranur to foster the development of Western Tamil Nadu. The ongoing track enhancement between Jolarpettai and Coimbatore should be fast-tracked to achieve 130 kmph. Restoration and doubling of the 1.2 km link line between Coimbatore-Podanur and Irugur-Podanur would facilitate unidirectional movement from Coimbatore Junction. Additionally, doubling the line from Mettupalayam to Coimbatore North would contribute to regional development. An Elevated Railway Corridor of approximately 10 km between Madukkarai nd Kanjikode on the Coimbatore-Shoranur section\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 line would help prevent wildlife casualties, particularly elephants. The \u2018B\u2019 line in this section posed a significant threat to the ecosystem, the Memorandum said. According to the delegation, the Railway Minister gave an assurance to consider the demands..

            "content": "Kylian Mbappe has hogged the headlines in the football arena. Reportedly, Neymar, his former PSG teammate, has warned his Brazil teammates at Real Madrid on playing with the France superstar. Mbappe recently signed a five-year contract with Real Madrid ending his eight-year association with Paris Saint Germain (PSG). For the unversed, Neymar and Mbappe played together at PSG from 2017 to 2023 and reportedly, there was notable tension all the time between the two high-profile players. The duo together racked up 54 goal combinations but Neymar doesn't seem to have enjoyed playing with the France international. Journalist Cyril Hanouna, while speaking to Europe 1, has revealed that the renowned Brazil football player has sent a warning to the likes of Vinicius Jr and other Brazilian contingent at Madrid terming his experience of playing with Mbappe as 'hell'. \"The Brazilians [at Real Madrid] are friends with Neymar. It has always been a war between Neymar and Mbappe\u0301. Neymar has sent a paper about Mbappe\u0301 to the Brazilians, telling them that it was catastrophic, that it was hell,\" Hanouna said. Interestingly, Mbappe and Neymar were joined by Lionel Messi at PSG in 2021 and it was expected that the trio would do magical things together. But nothing as such happened as they adapted to different styles. Neymar left PSG in 2023 to join Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal while Messi's association with PSG didn't last for more than two years as he signed Inter Miami in 2023. Mbappe's exit ended his eight-year-long stay with PSG, not on a happy note. However, the France international was the top player for them over the years having scored 256 goals (an all-time highest for the club) and also won a staggering 17 trophies with the club. Meanwhile, in his most recent appearance for Real Madrid, Kylian Mbappe also scored a goal in the 75th minute against Real Sociedad in La Liga to help his team win the match 2-0. Overall, he has scored three goals for his new club and will be aiming to continue performing well for the team.",

Verstappen, whose dominance in 2022 and 2023 broke records, still leads the standings but his last win was in June.I think this is the best season I can think of ever in Formula 1 since I've been here,\" Brown told The Associated Press from the IndyCar season finale at Nashville Superspeedway in Tennessee.Could it even be better than the 2021 fight between Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, which was decided on the final lap of the year and helped fuel F1's Netflix boom? Brown thinks it might be.That was mega exciting, but it's just two guys, two good guys. Now you've got four good teams in today'",

            "content": "The \u201cgirivalam\u201d at Thanjavur, an initiative reportedly undertaken by a Sivanadiyar group in Thanjavur a few years ago, is all set to be revived from September 17 \u2013 the \u201cPuratasi first Pournami\u201d day \u2013 with the support of government departments and the civic body. A group of devotees sponsoring the Pradosha Pujai at Sri Brahadeeswarar temple, popularly known as the Big Temple, twice a month, had taken up a similar initiative about six years ago. The interest among devotees who embarked on the \u201cgirivalam\u201d on the full moon day by going around the Big Temple complex gradually waned because of the poor illumination facility along the ramparts of the fortified World Heritage Monument, sources said. Claiming that the practice of going around the Big Temple under the moonlight on full moon day was in vogue in the recent past, R. Ravichandran, director, Azhagiya Thanjai \u2013 2005, an organisation involved in creating awareness of historical and cultural importance of the town, said it had been proposed to allow people to do circumambulation of Sri Brahadeeswarar temple through the outermost corridor of the complex from 5 p.m. on full moon day to 6 a.m. the following day. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting held at the Thanjavur Corporation headquarters in which government officials, those from the Archaeological Survey of India and the police participated. While the civic body assured the meeting that arrangements would be made for better illumination of the girivalam path abutting the ramparts along the Grand Anicut Canal on the South and the Seppanavari on the West, the police said they would tighten security arrangements. Meanwhile, a section of senior citizens in the town said they had not heard of such \u201cgirivalam\u201d practice during their younger days. Probably, a belief that the Rajarajeswaram (Big Temple) itself was a Mahameru (a sacred cosmological mountain with five peaks in Hindu cosmology which is considered to be the centre of all the physical, metaphysical and spiritual universes) might have influenced the organisers of the \u201cgirivalam\u201d event to promote the circumambulation on full moon day, they added.

            "content": "The city railway police have registered a cheating and forgery case against two employees of Indian Railways, who allegedly tried to get six berths reserved by forging a recommendation letter purportedly from the office of the Minister of State for Railways two years ago. Based on a complaint by R. Ramanathan, Chief Reservation Supervisor, the police booked Jackson Stalin and Jitendra Kumar recently for further investigation. Mr. Ramanathan in July 2022 received a request from the office of then Minister of State for Railways Raosaheb Patil Danve, containing six passenger name record numbers (PNRs) for the release of head office quota for Train No. 12295 Sanghamitra Express that had already been allotted. The request was sent to the Commercial Controller, Chennai, who sought to verify the veracity of the request. The office of the Minister of State for Railways said that the request had not originated from there and that it was fake. Meanwhile, the vigilance branch of South-Western Railway had referred the case for a fact-finding inquiry to the Railway Protection Force, Bengaluru division, on the advice of the Railway Board. The inquiry had revealed an organised racket of obtaining confirmed berths through the head office quota with the involvement of Jackson Stalin and Jitendra Kumar in collusion with outsiders through forgery and impersonation of VIPs and other officials of the Railways.

            "content": "Australia have called up their U19 World Cup star Mahli Beardman in their squad for the five-match ODI series against England as a standby player. The Aussies are looking to address the injury issues of their fast bowlers. Beardman was the Player of the Match of the U19 World Cup 2024 final against India as he picked 3/15 in Australia's victory. He is among the speedsters on whom the cricket board is keeping an eye alongside Callum Vidler, Charlie Anderson and Tom Straker. The Aussies are facing injury issues to their fast-bowling stocks. The likes of Xavier Bartlett, Nathan Ellis, Spencer Johnson and Riley Meredith have picked up injuries recently. Bartlett was ruled out of the England T20Is after a side strain in the first T20I against the Three Lions. Ellis was pulled from Australia's tour of Scotland after compounding his injury in The Hundred. Johnson and Meredith also sustained side issues with the former missing the whole Scotland series and the latter only playing in the first T20I. is not in the team too as he is building up for the five-match Test series against India later in the year, while Josh Hazlewood is being closely monitored after a calf issue saw him miss the Scotland series. Australia are taking caution for their big three (Hazlewood, Cummins and Mitchell Starc) ahead of the India Tests. \"A lot of our priorities will be geared around that. You'll see that unfold with the management of our players. We'll be very pointed around who does what in terms of [Sheffield] Shield cricket coming into the summer to make sure that they are ready for that first Test match,\" Australia's coach Andrew McDonald told SEN. The Aussies will be having four specialist fast bowlers for the England ODIs as Ben Dwarshuis, Starc, Hazlewood and Sean Abbott will form a four-pronged pace attack. All-rounders Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie and captain Mitch Marsh will be the other pace options available for the visitors. The series will begin on September 19 with the first ODI in Nottingham. The two teams will meet again a couple of days later in Leeds, before a face-off in Chester-Le-Street on September 24. The caravan will then head to the iconic Lord's for the fourth game on September 27, followed by the final match a couple of days later in Bristol.

            "content": "An Indian student, who had recently completed his master's degree and was job hunting in Canada, drowned in a lake on his birthday. According to reports, A. Praneeth, hailed from Hyderabad's Ranga Reddy district. The student had gone on a holiday with friends and his brother to a cottage near Clear Lake in Canada on Saturday. Praneeth had moved to Canada in 2019 for his studies, followed by his elder brother in 2022. A. Ravi, the victim's father said Praneeth went swimming with his friends and brother on Sunday morning but did not return to the shore. The devastated father said he got the tragic news of Praneeth's death from one of his son's friends. The local police were notified, and Ravi mentioned that rescue teams took over 10 hours to arrive at the lake. The body was recovered in the evening. The grieving family has appealed to the government for help in bringing Praneeth\u2019s body back to India. Praneeth\u2019s father expressed deep sorrow, highlighting the tragic irony that his son\u2019s birthday celebration turned into a day of mourning. The family is seeking support to expedite the repatriation process of Praneeth\u2019s body to Hyderabad. \u201cBoth along with other friends visited the lake to celebrate the birthday of Praneeth on Saturday. On Sunday, they went swimming. While everyone returned, the younger one ( Praneeth) did not,\u201d the grieving father told reporters. Earlier in July, an Indian student identified as Sai Surya Avinash Gadde, who was studying at Trine University, drowned at Barbervilley Falls in Albany, according to the Indian Consulate General in New York. This came after Guntipalli Sowmya, 25, a native of Telangana's Yadagirigutta and studying in Florida Atlantic University, was killed in a tragic road accident on May 26. She was killed by a speeding car while crossing the road in Florida. Media reports also claimed that she celebrated her 25th birthday on May 11. Prior to that, another Indian student died in a bike accident in the US on May 23. The deceased, Belem Atchyuth, was a student of the State University of New York (SUNY) who hailed from Andhra Pradesh. Three Indian-origin students were killed while two others were injured in a devastating car crash in the city of Alpharetta in the US State of Georgia earlier that month.",

            "content": "The Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) has urged both the Central and State governments to establish a new railway station at Solar for the benefit of passengers. In a press release, party\u2019s general secretary M. Yuvaraja said that Erode, one of the fastest growing cities in the State, had reputed industries and educational institutions in large numbers. Thousands of people from across the State visited the district for various purposes, including traders for marketing turmeric and for purchasing textile products resulting in frequent traffic congestion in the city. The Erode Outer Ring Road that was established to reduce congestion was also congested. To reduce congestion on city roads, a bus terminal is being established at Solar on Karur Bypass Road. But the work is carried out at a snail\u2019s pace, he claimed and wanted the works to be expedited. He said once the new terminal became operational, movement of passengers would be very high and would need additional transportation. Hence, a new railway station near the terminal would be a permanent solution, the release said and added that required land and tracks were already available at Solar. He said the station would serve people from southern districts and also help traders to move their goods quickly. The release sought additional platforms at Erode Railway Junction, upgrade of Thottipalayam railway station and ensuring all trains stop at the station to reduce congestion at main junction. The release urged elected representatives in the district to take up the issue with the respective governments.

Revanth Reddy has admitted the party\u2019s role, claimed BRS legislators K.P. Vivekanand, P. Kaushik Reddy, Dr. K. Sanjay Kumar and K. Naveen Kumar. At a press conference here, they stated that the Chief Minister had mentioned it was \u2018our men\u2019 (Congress activists) who went and attacked as Mr. Kaushik Reddy had no guts to go to Serilingampally MLA Arekapudi Gandhi\u2019s house, as announced. A case should be booked against the Chief Minister for his claims, they argued. The BRS legislators stated that they would soon meet the DGP, Home Secretary and the Governor on the CM\u2019s open statement and in case they do not get justice they would represent the matter to the President of the country. They also claimed that Congress activists had attacked BRS leaders in Khammam during their visit to flood-hit areas, attacked the camp office of T. Harish Rao at Siddipet and killed BRS activist B. Sridhar Reddy in Kollapur constituency. Mr. Vivekanand Goud alleged that the Chief Minister had betrayed people badly on all the pre-poll promises after coming to power and the ruling party was resorting to attention diversion politics as they were unable to fulfil them. Mr. Kaushik Reddy sought to know from the Chief Minister as to why the latter was getting him eliminated.

While talking to Vimal Kumar on his official YouTube channel, Ravichandran Ashwin stated that India has always been a batter-dominated country. \u201cIndia has always been the country that is a batsman-dominated country, and it\u2019s never going to change. But I am so glad and happy that we are celebrating Jasprit Bumrah. Jasprit Bumrah is a once-in-a-generation bowler. We should celebrate him even more,\u201d Ashwin said. \u201cWe Chennai people appreciate bowlers a lot. He was here for an event as a chief guest 4-5 days ago. We gave him a Rajni treatment. We (Chennai people) treat bowlers very nicely. He should be treated as a champion. I don\u2019t want to name, but Jasprit Bumrah is the most valuable Indian cricketer right now,\u201d he added.

Secretary of the organisation, K. Kathirmathiyon, said that under the Policy, permission for telecom infrastructure must be obtained from the District Collector, who acts as the Nodal Officer. The Nodal Officer was solely empowered to issue permissions within their jurisdiction, based on recommendations from other officers under their authority. He also highlighted that the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019 (section rule 62 regarding Telecommunication Structures), required applicants to submit a structural safety and stability certificate. This certificate must confirm the safety of both the telecom structure and the building on which it would be installed. He alleged that even with the policy in place, not all telecom service providers were obtaining the required permissions. Additionally, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation officials were unaware of the rules, leading to power connections being provided to telecom towers without necessary approvals. \u201cDespite the 2022 Government Order, over 100 mobile towers in Coimbatore Corporation limits alone have received electricity connections without approval in the past two years,\u201d Mr. Kathirmathiyon claimed. He urged the Collector to ensure that all telecom service providers obtained the necessary permissions as per the rules and that these instructions were strictly enforced. When contacted, Collector Kranthi Kumar Pati said, \u201cWe verify all the applications we receive and grant approval only if they meet all the necessary requirements. Moving forward, we will inform all telecom service providers of the need for proper permissions and enforce the rules more strictly.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 06:43 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Coimbatore / telecommunication service / telecommunication equipment",

As the keynote speaker at the \u2018Summit of Telugu Authors and Poets\u2019 held at the SPVM College at Gorantla of Sri Sathya Sai district on Monday, Mr. Swamy appealed to students interested in historical studies to create an abundance of short stories, essays, and poems in the Telugu language. He highlighted the presence of Telugu words in valuable historical sources such as the Kubheeraka inscription (400 BCE) in Bhattiprolu of Andhra Pradesh, the Mahendra-1 inscription (610 CE) at the Tiruchirapalli (TN) cave temple, the Telugu Chola Dhananjay\u2019s inscription (575 CE) at Kalamalla of Kadapa district, the II Bukka Raya\u2019s inscription (1388 CE) at Mereddipalli, and Sri Krishna Deva Raya\u2019s inscription (1524 CE) in Gorantla\u2019s Madhavaraya Swamy Temple. \u201cNumerous Telugu inscriptions serve as living examples of the richness of the language and culture,\u201d he added, while explaining the evolution of the Telugu language and culture during the Vijayanagara (Hampi) dynasty. Author Kalluru Raghavendra Rao said that students were more inclined towards technical education than traditional education, emphasising the importance of parents preserving the mother tongue.

Escorted by a pilot police vehicle, around 30 medics arrived at Ms. Banerjee's residence at 6.20 pm. The meeting was originally scheduled at 5 pm. Before departing from their sit-in spot outside Swasthya Bhavan, the health department headquarters, the protesters said they are being accompanied by two professional stenographers to record the minutes of the meeting. The protesters said they would not settle for anything less than the five demands they had previously placed before the government. The medics demanded accountability and punishment for those responsible for the rape-murder of a postgraduate trainee in RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9 and \"destruction\" of evidence; strict action against the former medical college principal Sandip Ghosh; resignation of Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal and Health Secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam; improved security for healthcare workers; and the eradication of the \"threat culture\" in government healthcare institutions.

CM Sarma also said that DGP informed him of another incident in North Lakhimpur, where \"cheating material\" was recovered from the inner garments of a woman candidate during the exam. Taking to social media platform X, Sarma said, ''My instruction to the police on the Nalbari incident - I spoke with the DGP, Assam, G P Singh and instructed him to investigate the incident where a girl student has alleged that a lady constable searched her private parts before she entered the examination hall.\" He added that the dignity and respect of 'mothers and sisters' are of utmost importance and non-negotiable for him. He further said that there are two tasks before the government - to conduct the ADRE exam with transparency and thge development of proper SOP. He said that the government has a crucial task of conducting the Assam Direct Recruitment Examination (ADRE) with the \"highest level of integrity and transparency.\" Sarma added, ''We owe this to the entire younger generation of ours, and it cannot be compromised under any circumstances.\" Regarding the development of SOP, Sarma said, \"At the same time, it must be ensured that the \"decency and dignity of female candidates are upheld at all times. Therefore a proper standard operating procedure (SOP) should be developed, taking into account the relevant judgments from the Hon\u2019ble Courts and guidelines from the Women\u2019s Commission regarding the conduct of searches involving women, and this must be circulated before the next round of examinations",

            "content": "The State Department of Electronics, Information Technology, Biotechnology, and Science and Technology, and the Karnataka Digital Economy Mission (KDEM) are organising the 4th edition of the Mysuru Big Tech Show 2024 on September 19 at Infosys Global Centre in Mysuru. The event aims to position Mysuru as a prominent global hub for Deeptech, Cybersecurity, AI/ML, talent supply, ESDM, and GCC destinations. The objective of the event is to attract more investments, promote the establishment of new enterprises, and create an environment conducive to sustaining existing businesses along with skilled talent supply. The event will witness the participation of over 450 delegates, 45 global speakers, 60 students, six country partners, 15 colleges, 25 startup display booths and incubators, and media and technology stakeholders, a press release said. The Big Tech Show-2024 was announced last month when the State government along with Karnataka Digital Economy Mission (KDEM), and India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) conducted the first-ever ESDM Tech Yatra (Electronic System Design and Manufacturing) in Mysuru. It is an initiative to showcase the readiness of the Mysuru cluster to the ESDM world and drive a potential investment pipeline into the cluster along with talent sourcing. Efforts are on to position Mysuru as a hub for ESDM. The government aims to elevate Karnataka\u2019s ESDM sector globally by fostering collaboration among industry, startups, and academia, showcasing Bengaluru-Mysuru corridor as a premier technology hub. During the ESDM Tech Yatra here last month, the event highlighted the business potential and the organisers said the sector would attract significant investments exceeding \u20b91,000 crore and generate over 5,000 new jobs, creating numerous job opportunities, promoting local innovation, and enhancing the sector\u2019s global brand. They said it will drive economic growth and position Mysuru as a Centre for Technological Advancement. ESDM driven activities in the Bengaluru-Mysuru corridor were being pushed with Bengaluru projected as a design hub and Mysuru as a manufacturing hub.

            "content": "A video of an ASI in Madhya Pradesh Police went viral on social media in which he is seen putting off his uniform after councillor's husband threatened him by saying - wardi utarva dunga (will strip your uniform). In the viral video, an ASI is seen taking off his uniform in front of senior police personnel and municipal corporation officials in the police station. Everyone was stunned seeing ASI's reaction. The video that went viral on social media is said to be of February 2, 2024, i.e. 7 months old. 7 months ago, there was a dispute between ASI Vinod Mishra of Kotwali police station and locals regarding the construction of drain in the Kotwali police station area of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bthe district. After the dispute, the officials of the municipal corporation and the police officials inspected the spot and everyone reached the Kotwali police station to resolve the matter. While there was a discussion about resolving the dispute in the police station, BJP leader and councilor's husband Arjun Gupta threatened ASI Vinod Mishra to strip his uniform. Due to this, the ASI lost his temper and took off his uniform in front of everyone. The incident was captured in the CCTV camera installed in the police station. After the incident, SP Nivedita Gupta took action against the ASI for tearing the uniform. Surprisingly, after 7 months, this matter once again revived. Currently, on this entire matter, the SP ordered an investigation into the matter of leaking the CCTV footage of the police station and making the video viral on social media. After the video went viral, politics was also on the rise in this matter. MP Congress wrote on the social media handle X, \"This is the power of authority...look at the threat of the BJP councillor...a uniformed man had to tear his uniform!! The level of policing in the state has reached zero! Crime is out of control, criminals are fearless and the police is helpless at some places and under pressure at others.\"",

            "content": "The 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election is likely to see another Thackeray family member entering the fray as Amit Thackeray, son of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, has expressed his desire to contest the upcoming polls. This was revealed during a party meeting held on Monday (September 16). Sources indicate that Amit Thackeray, currently serving as the President of the Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena, expressed his interest in contesting the election himself. He also urged prominent party leaders to enter the election battlefield during what is expected to be a highly watched assembly poll. While sources suggested that Amit Thackeray may contest from the Mahim, Bhandup, or Magathane Assembly Constituencies in Mumbai, a final decision on his political debut will be made once Raj Thackeray gives his confirmation. Amit Thackeray, responding to calls from party leaders urging him to run, has stated that he is ready to contest from any constituency. Notably, in July, MNS chief Raj Thackeray announced that his party would go solo in the Maharashtra Assembly elections. \"We will fight 200 to 250 seats in the state elections,\" Raj Thackeray said. He had previously extended unconditional support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA in the Lok Sabha elections.",

There have been multiple attempts to inflate a punctured balloon but the thorn pricked by the public in the Lok Sabha elections has not given Narendra Modi any chance to rise again,\" she said.\"Do you remember the tall claims made .",

            "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has deleted an , wherein he questioned why there were no attempts to kill US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. His controversial comment on the social media platform, X, came hours after former US President Donald Trump's apparent second assassination attempt. \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala\". The insensitive post came in response to a query from an X user with the handle @cb_doge, who asked why the former President was being targeted. After facing huge backlash on social media, Musk, who is also a good friend of Trump, deleted the post and wrote, \"Well, one lesson I have learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh, it doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X.\" Trump was the target of what the FBI said \"appears to be an attempted assassination\" at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on September 15, just nine weeks after the Republican presidential nominee survived another attempt on his life. The former president said he was safe and well, and authorities held a man in custody. CNN, Fox News and The New York Times identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. On April 21, Routh directed an X message to Elon Musk, in which he wrote: \"I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putin's Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please.\" The New York Times reported it had interviewed Routh in 2023 for an article about Americans who were volunteering to help the Ukraine war effort. Routh told the Times he'd travelled to Ukraine and spent several months there in 2022 and was trying to recruit Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. Earlier this year, Routh tagged Biden in a post on X: \"@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. (With inputs from agencies)",

            "content": "Bollywood star Govinda's wife, Sunita Ahuja, recounted a shocking incident on a podcast where a fan, disguised as a maid, lived with them for nearly three weeks to be close to Govinda. New Delhi: Bollywood icon Govinda, renowned for his blockbuster hits like 'Coolie No. 1', 'Hero No. 1' and 'Aunty No. 1', has been at the center of an astonishing story involving one of his most devoted fans. In a recent episode of the popular podcast 'Timeout with Ankit,' Sunita Ahuja, Govinda's wife, revealed a bizarre incident where a fan disguised herself as a maid and lived with the couple for nearly three weeks. Watch The Podcast Here: According to Sunita Ahuja, the situation began when a young woman, who was an ardent admirer of Govinda, managed to infiltrate their household by posing as a domestic worker. \"Ek ladki toh bai ban kar aa gyi idhar sa**li ghar pe,\" Sunita recounted during the podcast. She described how the girl appeared out of place with her cleaning skills, which prompted Sunita to question her authenticity. \"Maine bola yaar ye toh acche ghar ki ladki hai, maine apni mother-in-law ko bola ki isko toh bartan ghasne ko nhi aata hai, jhaadoo bartan nhi aata hai,\" Sunita explained. Further investigations revealed the girl\u2019s true identity and her extraordinary admiration for Govinda. Sunita shared, \"Mera toh dimaag satak gaya, jitna bhi choti hu mai, maine bola ye bartan nhi maangh skti hai, na hi isse jhadoo ho rahe hain.\" The discovery was made even more shocking when Sunita learned that the girl was the daughter of a minister and had managed to live with them for an extended period purely out of her admiration for Govinda. Sunita detailed the girl's unusual behavior, noting that she would stay up late into the night, ostensibly to catch a glimpse of Govinda. \"Dekho toh, mai raat ko jaagna kaha, ye raat ko Govinda ke liye jaagi hai,\" Sunita remarked. The situation only came to light after Sunita's mother-in-law also became suspicious and urged further inquiry. Eventually, the truth emerged when the young woman broke down and admitted her identity. \"Fir meri mother-in-law bhi boli 'pata kro ye ladki kaun hai?' Fir vo roo roo ke boli ki mai inki fan hu,\" Sunita said. The fan\u2019s revelation led to an influx of political figures, including several cars, as they arrived to address the unusual situation. Sunita confirmed that the fan stayed with them for about 20 days before the situation was resolved. Despite the unusual circumstances, Sunita expressed relief that nothing untoward occurred during this period. \"Mere khyaal se 20 din ruki hogi,\" she concluded, adding her gratitude that the situation was not harmful. About Govinda And Sunita Govinda and Sunita got married in 1987, a year after his Bollywood debut. Concerned that marriage might hinder his career, the couple chose to keep their union private for over a year. They publicly revealed their marriage when their daughter, Tina, celebrated her first birthday.",

Vishwakarma Puja, celebrated on the birth anniversary of Lord Vishwakarma, the divine architect and creator of the universe, holds great significance, especially for those in manufacturing, engineering, and artisan professions. This year, Vishwakarma Puja falls on September 16, 2024, according to the Drik Panchang. Significance of Vishwakarma Puja Vishwakarma Puja, also known as Vishwakarma Jayanti, is a Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Vishwakarma, revered as the divine architect of the universe. The festival is highly significant for professionals in various industries like manufacturing, engineering, architecture, mechanics, and artisanship. Devotees pray for blessings, seeking prosperity, safety in the workplace, and success in their respective fields. It is common for workers to worship their tools and machinery, asking for smooth operations and a productive year ahead. Date and Muhurat for Vishwakarma Puja 2024 In 2024, Vishwakarma Jayanti will be celebrated on September 16, coinciding with Bhadra Sankranti or Kanya Sankranti, the final day of the Bengali month of Bhadra. As per the Drik Panchang, the auspicious time for the puja, known as Sankranti Muhurat, is predicted to be at 7:53 PM. History of Vishwakarma Jayanti The roots of Vishwakarma Jayanti trace back to ancient Indian scriptures, including the Rigveda, one of the oldest Hindu texts, which mentions Lord Vishwakarma as the divine craftsman.

            "content": "Indian skipper Rohit Sharma is on the verge of two major milestones in the upcoming Test series against Bangladesh. Scroll down to check which records he can break. IND vs BAN: Indian skipper Rohit Sharma will have some milestones to chase as he prepares to take on Bangladesh in the first Test of the two-match series at Chennai from Thursday. The two-match series will kick off on September 19 in Chennai at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. The second long-format game will begin on September 27 in Kanpur. In his first Test assignment, head coach Gautam Gambhir will be keen on securing a series win. The Indian skipper has enjoyed a fine run of form in the ongoing ICC World Test Championship 2023-25 so far, scoring 700 runs in nine matches and 16 innings at an average of 46.66, with three centuries and three fifties. His best score is 131. He is the 12th highest run-getter in the competition so far. Rohit has two milestones to look for during the series. Getting to the first milestone will seal his legacy as the country's finest six-hitter. With 84 sixes in Tests, Rohit is at 11th place among top six-hitters in the world. He just needs eight more big hits to displace legendary Virender Sehwag (91) to become team's leading six-hitter in Test cricket. England skipper Ben Stokes (131), former New Zealand wicketkeeper-batter Brendon McCullum (107) and iconic Australian wicketkeeper-batter Adam Gilchrist (100) are the top three sixes in the world. If Rohit goes on a big six-hitting spree in these two games, he could also become only the fourth overall and first Indian batter to have smashed 100 sixes in Tests. The 'Hitman' is also nearing the half-centuries of centuries in international cricket. With 48 centuries in 483 matches, he is just two more tons away from reaching 50 international centuries. He will become only the third Indian batter to reach this milestone and overall 10th player to do so. Currently from India, only Sachin Tendulkar (100 centuries) and Virat Kohli (80 centuries) have crossed a half-century of centuries in international cricket. For Rohit Sharma's side, this series against Bangladesh will be followed by New Zealand's tour of India for three Tests starting from October 16, and then the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia from November 22. India's squad for the 1st Test against Bangladesh: Rohit Sharma (C), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Sarfaraz Khan, Rishabh Pant (WK), Dhruv Jurel (WK), R Ashwin, R Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Jasprit Bumrah, Yash Dayal.",

            "content": "Former Inspector-General of Police of Idol Wing CID A.G. Ponn Manickavel on Monday appeared before the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in adherence to the conditions laid down by the Madras High Court in connection with a case filed against him. The CBI had registered a case against the former police officer following an order of the Madras High Court on a petition filed by former officer Kader Batcha, who had levelled allegations against Mr. Manickavel. The CBI\u2019s case is that when Mr. Manickavel was the chief investigating officer heading the Idol Wing CID, he falsely implicated police officers including Kader Batcha as accused in a criminal case, without any evidence, by pressuring the accused in idol theft/smuggling cases to give confession statements against them. After the CBI filed the case, Mr. Manickavel moved a petition seeking advance bail. Last month, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court granted him anticipatory bail, and also imposed certain conditions on him, including a requirement that he should report before the CBI, Anti Corruption Branch, Shastri Bhawan, Chennai, at 10.30 a.m. every day for four weeks, and thereafter as and when required, for interrogation. Complying with the conditions, Mr. Manickavel on Monday appeared before the CBI officer concerned and signed on the register.

            "content": "The largest and heaviest coin in the world is called Rai, or Yapese stone money, and it is found on the island of Yap in Micronesia. Some of these enormous limestone disks have a mass of over 4,000 pounds and a diameter of 12 feet. They are employed in ceremonies and cultural contexts as status and riches symbols. They are a distinctive feature of Yapese society and are still used for transactions despite their size. One of the world's most unusual currencies, the Rai stone, is found on the tiny island of Yap in the Pacific Ocean. The money on this Micronesian island is constructed of enormous limestone discs, some of which weigh up to several tons and have a diameter of more than 12 feet, in contrast to conventional coins or banknotes. Not only are these \"coins\" the biggest and heaviest in the world, but they also symbolize an intriguing cultural custom that is ingrained in Yap's past. Where Did Rai Stones Come From? The Yapese started removing stones from the island of Palau, which is located more than 250 miles away, in 500 AD, which is when the Rai stones first appeared. It was no easy task to move these enormous stones across the ocean; frequently, a whole crew of locals and big canoes were needed. The labor-intensive and hazardous nature of the process raised the value of the stones. Remarkably, a stone's value isn't always determined by its size. Rather, the stone's past\u2014including how challenging it was to transport, whether any lives were lost in the process, and how old it is\u2014determines its value. Because of their historical significance, the Rai stones are more than just a means of exchange; they are status and prestige markers. How Rai Stones Operate as Money Even though it may be difficult to imagine, the Yapese have created a special system for employing enormous stones as money. Seldom do the stones physically exchange hands. Rather, ownership is passed down orally, and the stones stay in the same spot for many years. Every member of the community is aware of who owns which stone, and decisions are made based on this shared understanding. The Importance of Culture The Rai stones are more valuable than money since they are a part of Yap society's social and political structure. Though most daily transactions now utilize contemporary currency, the stones are still used today in some traditional ceremonies and as a sign of riches. Yap's enormous Rai stones are still an amazing representation of the island's culture and provide insight into the unusual ways in which communities may assign value.",

Sources told India TV that after meeting with the PAC, the legislative party meeting will be held at 11 am on Tuesday when the name of the new CM will be approved in the meeting. Earlier in the day, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he sought time for a meeting with Lt Governor VK Saxena on Tuesday and is likely to tender his resignation. The AAP supremo had said he would become chief minister and Manish Sisodia his deputy \"only when people say we are honest\". \"The chief minister has sought time from Saxena for a meeting on Tuesday. He is likely to tender his resignation,\" the party said on Monday. Days after being released from Tihar jail on bail in the excise policy case, the AAP national convenor said on Sunday that he would resign within 48 hours and sought early polls in Delhi. He vowed not to sit in the chief minister's chair till people gave him a \"certificate of honesty\". He had said he would hold a meeting of AAP MLAs in a couple of days and a party leader would take over as chief minister.",

After 5 to 10 minutes, rinse, massage, and apply to the face. For seven days, repeat each day. While baking soda exfoliates and balances the pH of the skin, coconut oil hydrates, minimizing wrinkles and fine lines for more youthful, smooth skin. Many people want youthful, bright skin, and while there are a gazillion lotions, serums, and treatments available, often the best answers can be found in nature. A straightforward, two-ingredient coconut oil mixture that claims to remove wrinkles in just seven days is one such cure that is becoming more and more well-liked. What's superior than that? These ingredients are probably already in your kitchen. Coconut Oil Power For a long time, coconut oil has been promoted as a skincare and cosmetic miracle worker. Because of its rich fatty acid and antioxidant content, it is an effective moisturizer that profoundly nourishes the skin. Coconut oil, which is high in lauric acid and vitamin E, penetrates the skin's layers to help with damage healing, elasticity improvement, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. While coconut oil is good on its own, its anti-aging effects can be enhanced when combined with another potent component. The Secret Ingredient: Baking Soda Baking soda is the second ingredient in this wonder mixture that reduces wrinkles. Baking soda is well known for its exfoliating qualities, which aid in removing dead skin cells to reveal smoother, younger skin. In addition, it lowers inflammation, restores the pH balance of the skin, and helps lessen the visibility of blemishes, dark spots, and other aging symptoms. The Baking Soda Mix Recipe with Coconut Oil It's easy to make this wrinkle-fighting concoction. In a small bowl, combine half a teaspoon of baking soda with one tablespoon of organic coconut oil. Mix until a uniform, smooth paste forms. Apply the mixture to your face, paying particular attention to wrinkles and fine lines. After giving it a few minutes of light circular massage, let it sit for ten to fifteen minutes before rinsing it off with warm water. Results You Can See in Just 7 Days This mixture of coconut oil and baking soda can make your skin feel softer, smoother, and visibly younger with continued usage. Many consumers have noted a noticeable decrease in the look in just seven days. Try this easy, all-natural cure, and see your skin glow with youthful health.",

Earlier today, the government sent a fresh invite to the protesting doctors, to which doctors replied with certain conditions. In their mail to the Chief Secretary, junior doctors said, \"We would like to reiterate that after the last proposed meeting, two significant developments happened.\" Junior doctors emphasised that after the last proposed meeting, two arrests, former principal Sandeep Ghosh and TALA PS OC, have been made. The doctors highlighted, \"These two new developments increase the significance of transparency of the meeting even more than before.\" To conduct the meeting, the doctors urged the government to accept one of the proposed three conditions.

The award for The Life of Chuck was announced on Sunday (September 15, 2024) as North American's largest film festival drew to a close. The Life of Chuck, based on King's 2020 novella of the same name, stars Tom Hiddleston as Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Krantz, an ordinary man living through apocalyptic cataclysms. Mark Hamill, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan and Jacob Tremblay co-star. TIFF's People's Choice Award is regarded as a reliable Oscar harbinger. Since 2012, every winner of the festival's top prize has gone on to be nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards. Last year, Cord Jefferson's American Fiction won, and went on to be a major awards contender. But The Life of Chuck could test that track record. The film is up for sale and doesn't yet have distribution. It could be acquired and quickly readied for release this fall, or it might end up a 2025 release. The Life of Chuck drew mixed \u2014 though mostly positive reviews \u2014 out of Toronto, though audiences were clearly charmed by the uplifting drama. Runners-up for the People's Choice Award, which is voted on by festival attendees, were both films that first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The first was Jacques Audiard's Emilia Pe\u0301rez. The second runner-up was Sean Baker's Anora , the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes .

            "content": "India\u2019s 100th year at the Olympics is the muse of artists commissioned by JSW Foundation \u2014 the social development arm of the JSW Group \u2014 to create a total of four artworks. In collaboration with Karishma Swali, director of Chanakya School of Craft, and artist Sujata Bajaj, the foundation attempts at exploring India\u2019s recent wins at the sports gala and celebrating its association with France, which is now hosting Paralympics Games Paris 2024. While Karishma Swali and Chanakya School of Craft have shouldered the curation and execution of three artworks strung on the theme Citius\u2014Altius\u2014Fortius (stronger, higher, faster, together), the one created by Sujata Bajaj, who shares her career history with Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, is an ode to the shared cultural symbols of India and France. \u201cThe artworks were first revealed at the Town Hall in Paris where we co-hosted a dinner with the Indian Olympic Association and its President Dr. P.T. Usha for the Indian athletes at the Paris Olympic\u201924. The artworks will be part of the corporate collection of the JSW Group,\u201d says Sangita Jindal, chairperson of JSW Foundation. She adds that the works were commissioned in 2023 and made over the course of several months. Sakshi Malik\u2019s groundbreaking bronze in wrestling| Photo Credit:Special arrangement Alongside the central piece featuring Olympic torch and a wreath, artworks created by Chanakya School of Craft depict Olympians Neeraj Chopra and Sakshi Malik. \u201cThe decision to feature Sakshi Malik and Neeraj Chopra was guided by their recent groundbreaking accomplishments that have inspired a new generation of athletes. Sakshi\u2019s historic bronze in wrestling at the 2016 Rio Olympics and Neeraj\u2019s gold in javelin at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics align with the broader narrative of India\u2019s evolving presence on the global sports stage. Their achievements represent the spirit of breaking new ground, much like the innovative techniques and artistic expressions we employed in this collaboration,\u201d says Karishma. In fact, the JSW Foundation has gifted the artwork showcasing Olympic winner Neeraj Chopra to the athlete after he bagged the silver medal in men\u2019s javelin throw this year. Neeraj Chopra\u2019s historic gold in javelin| Photo Credit:Special arrangement The three interdisciplinary artworks have been made with intricate hand embroidery techniques. Karishma explains, \u201cWe chose vibrant yet grounded colours to evoke the energy and passion of the athletes, while also paying homage to India\u2019s rich textile heritage. The silhouettes are fluid, capturing the dynamic movements of sports and the subtle grace of craft. The works are handcrafted using a variety of materials and needlepoint techniques, such as couching, bullion knots, running stitch, crochet, and stem stitch, complemented by carpet-weaving methods like hand-knotting and hand-tufting\u201d. Over 20 artisans, each with expertise in different embroidery and weaving techniques, contributed to the crafting of these pieces. Sangita Jindal at Chanakya School of Craft| Photo Credit:Special arrangement In Sujata\u2019s painting, India\u2019s Ashoka Chakra emerges from an Olympic circle, surrounded by metallic glints of gold, silver and bronze representing medals. The vibrant colours of the French and Indian flags \u2014 orange, green, blue, white and red \u2014 feature prominently. \u201cThe painting uses acrylic paints on canvas with added gold and silver foiling. The painting technique involves a lot of overlapping fluidity, which can be interpreted as an absence of boundaries,\u201d says Sujata while adding that it took about a month of working around the clock to complete the artwork. Sujata Bajaj\u2019s Artwork| Photo Credit:Special arrangement Interestingly, once upon a time there used to be a fine arts segment included in the Olympic Games, says Sujata. \u201cIn a way, the JSW event including creativity in such a prominent way could be seen as a commemoration of this. A connection that can be made between art and sport is that they both transcend borders in nature and in practice. It is a performance which can be experienced by anyone regardless of language, requiring nothing else than willingness to absorb passion and expression. My canvas is an embodiment of this,\u201d she shares. The artworks are not for sale and will be part of the corporate collection of the JSW Group.

            "content": "Skipper Harmanpreet Singh\u2019s sublime form resulted in twin strikes as defending champions India entered the final of the Asian Champions Trophy with a clinical 4-1 win against South Korea in the semifinal in Hulunbuir on Monday (September 16, 2024). India scored through Uttam Singh (13th minute), skipper Harmanpreet Singh (19th, 45th) and Jarmanpreet Singh (32nd), while Korea\u2019s lone goal came from through Yang Jihun (33rd)\u2018s penalty corner conversion. India will take on hosts China in Tuesday\u2019s final. Earlier in the day, China defeated Pakistan 2-0 via shoot-out in the first semifinal after the two teams finished 1-1 at the end of regulation 60 minutes. In the previous league stage encounter between the two finalists, India prevailed 3-0. Pakistan and Korea will face off in the third place classification match which will also be played on Tuesday. Meanwhile in the fifth-sixth place classification match, Japan beat Malaysia 4-2 in shoot-out following a 4-4 stalemate in normal time. In the second semifinal as expected, the Indians started on the offensive and tested the Korean defence with persistent attacks from the word go. The Koreans, on the other hand, were contend to sit back and defend and rely on sporadic counter attacks. Abhishek came tantalisingly close to handing India the lead in the fourth minute but his reverse hit was brilliantly saved by Korean goalkeeper Kim Jaehan. The Indian made promising build ups and penetrated the Korean circle on consistent basis in the first quarter. India\u2019s attacking intent finally paid of in the 13th minute when Uttam positioned himself at the right place at the right time to tap in Araijeet Singh Hundal\u2019s supply from the right. A minute from the first break, Korea secured back-to-back penalty corners but failed to utilise the chances. Four minutes into the second quarter, India secured their first penalty corner and Harmanpreet scored his sixth goal of the tournament to hand his side a 2-0 lead. At the stroke of half-time, custodian Suraj Karkera came out of his line to save an effort from the opposition player. India continued in the same vein after the change of ends and extended their lead two minutes into the third quarter. A brilliant scoop from Sumit from the right finds Jarmanpreet just outside the circle on the left flank and the latter neatly collected the ball and took a step or two to get inside the circle and slap the ball into the Korean goal to extend India\u2019s lead. But Korea pulled one back a minute later from a penalty corner through the tournament\u2019s top-scorer Yang Jihun. The goal hardly bothered the Indians as they continued their attacking game and dominated the share of exchanges. With a second left for the third quarter, India secured another penalty corner when Korean goalkeeper Jaehan was shown the yellow card for handling the ball out side the circle, and Harmanpreet made no mistake to extend the lead. Eight minutes from the final hooter, India\u2019s second goalkeeper Karkera made a fine double save to deny Park Cheoleon, but the Koreans secured a penalty corner which went in vain. Thereafter, it was controlled show from the Indians as they defended their lead with consummate ease to march into their fifth final appearance in the tournament.

            "content": "The last time fans saw Dhoni in action was back during the IPL 2024 game between RCB and CSK. His future in the cash-rich league is still under the scanner as the Ranchi-based cricketer has not provided any statement on his retirement. Former India skipper MS Dhoni was spotted enjoying his off time after the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. The wicketkeeper batter was seen spending time with friends in the USA and he also attended a game of American football. A picture of the same went viral on social media the moment it got shared by one of Dhoni\u2019s friends. The former India skipper seemed happy as he posed for photographs with his friends. The last time fans saw Dhoni in action was back during the IPL 2024 game between RCB and CSK. His future in the cash-rich league is still under the scanner as the Ranchi-based cricketer has not provided any statement on his retirement. A post shared by Hitesh Sanghvi (@hitesh412740) A post shared by Whistle Podu Army (@whistlepoduarmy) Earlier, while taking part in an event, Dhoni stated that he will do what is best for the team. The IPL governing council on the other hand is yet to announce the retention rules for the upcoming season of the competition. The umping edition of the IPL will see a mega auction where the teams will have to name their retained players. The IPL retention regulations are likely to play a huge role in Dhoni\u2019s future with the CSK as they will have to release their top players if they want to retain the legendary player. \u201cThere is a lot of time for it. We have to see what decision they take on player retention etc. Right now, the ball is not in our court. So, once the rules and regulations get formalised, I will take a call, but needs to be in the best interest of the team,\u201d said Dhoni. Talking about Dhoni\u2019s IPL career, the former CSK skipper has smashed 24 half-centuries, with his highest IPL score being 84* runs. The former India player collected 363 fours and 252 sixes in his IPL career.",

            "content": "World Ozone Day, celebrated on September 16th, raises awareness about the importance of the ozone layer and global efforts to protect it through the Montreal Protocol. World Ozone Day , observed on September 16th each year, marks the anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987. This day is dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of the ozone layer and the actions needed to preserve it. The ozone layer acts as Earth's protective shield, absorbing the majority of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation , which can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and other health issues, as well as damage crops and marine ecosystems. What is the Ozone Layer? The ozone layer is a thin part of Earth's atmosphere, located in the stratosphere, that contains high concentrations of ozone (O3) molecules . This layer absorbs the majority of the sun\u2019s harmful UV-B and UV-C rays, preventing them from reaching the Earth's surface. Without this protective barrier, life on Earth would be exposed to severe radiation, which could have catastrophic consequences for humans, animals, and plants. The Montreal Protocol: A Landmark Environmental Agreement World Ozone Day commemorates the Montreal Protocol, a global treaty designed to phase out the production and consumption of substances that deplete the ozone layer, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons. Since its adoption, the Protocol has been a resounding success, with nearly 99% of ozone-depleting substances eliminated globally. Due to the collective global effort, the ozone layer has shown signs of recovery. According to reports, it is expected to return to pre-1980 levels by the middle of the century if current policies are maintained. The Montreal Protocol is often hailed as one of the most successful international environmental agreements in history. The Importance of Protecting the Ozone Layer The depletion of the ozone layer is not just an environmental issue but a public health concern. A thinning ozone layer means more UV radiation reaches the Earth, increasing the risk of skin cancer and cataracts in humans. It also negatively affects plant growth, reducing agricultural productivity, and harms marine life, particularly plankton, which is a vital part of the ocean's food chain. By reducing ozone-depleting substances, we also indirectly contribute to the fight against climate change. Many of the chemicals that destroy the ozone layer are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. The Montreal Protocol has, in effect, prevented significant carbon emissions, thereby helping to slow the pace of climate change. How Can We Contribute? While the Montreal Protocol has been a success, the work is far from over. On World Ozone Day, individuals, businesses, and governments can take the following steps to contribute to ozone protection: 1. Avoid the use of products containing ozone-depleting chemicals: Many old appliances and products, like refrigerators and air conditioners, still contain CFCs or other harmful substances. Replace them with environmentally friendly alternatives. 2. Support renewable energy: Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels decreases greenhouse gas emissions and promotes a healthier environment, which in turn supports ozone recovery. 3. Promote awareness and education: Educating others about the importance of the ozone layer and the steps being taken to protect it can encourage responsible behavior and decision-making. 4. Conserve energy: Using less energy reduces demand for fossil fuels, cutting down on pollutants that can harm the ozone layer and contribute to climate change. The Theme of World Ozone Day 2024 Each year, World Ozone Day has a specific theme to highlight different aspects of ozone protection. The theme for World Ozone Day 2024 is \u2018Montreal Protocol: Healing the Ozone Layer for a Healthier Planet\u2019. This theme highlights the continued importance of the Montreal Protocol in global efforts to protect the ozone layer and emphasizes the need for sustained action to ensure its recovery. World Ozone Day serves as a reminder of the remarkable progress made under the Montreal Protocol and the critical importance of protecting the ozone layer for future generations. As global citizens, it is our responsibility to support initiatives that safeguard the environment and help heal the ozone layer, ensuring a healthier and safer planet for all.",

            "content": "Despite Monday (September 16, 2024) being a holiday for Milad-Un-Nabi, Hyderabad saw significant traffic congestion in various parts of the city during the afternoon and evening. With the Ganesh immersion scheduled for Tuesday (September 17, 2024) traffic is expected to increase from Monday night through Tuesday evening. While the morning saw relatively smooth traffic at Tank Bund , the situation changed by the afternoon. Due to the ninth day of Ganesh immersion, heavy traffic built up, causing slow-moving vehicles on all roads leading to Tank Bund. The stretch from People\u2019s Plaza to PVNR Marg was especially congested, with large trucks carrying Ganesh idols for immersion. These trucks were lined up bumper-to-bumper, with some carrying devotees who sang devotional songs and played music. Massive cranes were arranged at People\u2019s Plaza at Necklace Road in Hyderabad for immersion of Ganesh Idols on Monday (September 16, 2024).| Photo Credit:RAMAKRISHNA G \u201cI left for the office in the morning, taking the route from Tarnaka to Steel Bridge on my way to Banjara Hills, and the roads were mostly empty,\u201d said Ayush, an architectural trainee from Habsiguda. \u201cHowever, when I returned around 3 p.m., the situation was completely different\u2014Lakdikapul and the Telugu Talli flyover were both jam-packed with traffic.\u201d he said. Long haul trucks carrying Ganesh idols wait in serpentine queue on Necklace road for immersion of the idols in Hussain Sagar, Hyderabad on Monday (September 16, 2024).| Photo Credit:RAMAKRISHNA G At the same time, other parts of the city also experienced traffic as empty trucks and vehicles returned from the immersion process. Slow-moving traffic was reported from AR Petrol Pump, Gun Park, Ravindra Bharathi, and the DGP Office towards Lakdi-ka-Pul. \u201cWe started from Adikmet around 10 a.m. for the immersion of a Ganesh idol. Due to the heavy rush, it took us five hours for the immersion, and we only returned around 3 a.m.,\u201d shared Ramesh, a driver who had parked a truck in Tarnaka. A similar situation was observed in other areas where Ganesh immersions were taking place.

            "description": "\u201cBails are granted against surety bonds worth \u20b930,000 each,\u201d a news report said",
            "content": "An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Monday (September 16, 2024) ordered the immediate release of all the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) lawmakers arrested from the Parliament House following the party's power show on September 8 in Islamabad. \u201cAnti-Terrorism Court Judge Abul Hasnat Zulqarnain heard the bail pleas and granted post-arrest bail to the PTI MNAs who were taken into custody by the Islamabad police with their cases registered at the Sangjani police station,\u201d Geo News reported. \u201cThe bails were granted against surety bonds worth \u20b930,000 each,\u201d it said. Pakistan at risk of parochialism, says former PM Imran Khan During the hearing, prosecutor Raja Naveed told the court that Sunni Ittehad Council lawmaker Muhammad Ahmed Chattha is also named in the case. He requested the court against approving bails as the minimum sentence for provisions imposed in the case is three years, the channel said. \"Has anything been recovered from Sher Afzal Marwat, Ahmed Chattha and other MNAs [Member of the National Assembly]?\" the judge questioned the prosecutor. He responded to the question in the negative. Meanwhile, the court also approved the pre-arrest bail petition filed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Ali Bukhari in the case pertaining to his violation of the No Objection Certificate (NOC) and assault on police personnel during the party's rally. Following the hearing, the court issued a notice and adjourned the hearing of the case till October 1. The police arrested several leaders of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, including its chairman and around a dozen lawmakers, after the authorities accused his supporters of pelting stones at police personnel and violating the permission for the rally by over-stepping the allotted time limit by several hours. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and lawmaker Sher Afzal Marwat were also arrested from the Parliament House for allegedly violating the newly enacted public gathering law during the party\u2019s power show. Mr. Marwat had resisted the arrest and asked the police to show an arrest warrant. While Mr. Gohar was later released, Mr. Marwat was kept in custody for violating regulations devised under a new law \u2014 Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill, 2024, and also accused of clashing with police personnel on the rally day. At least 10 PTI lawmakers, who were arrested from the premises of Parliament House, were brought to the lower house on September 12 after their production orders were issued by National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq. During the rally, the PTI supporters demanded the release of their leader and warned to get him out of jail through street protests. The 71-year-old former-cricketer-turned-politician faces a slew of legal cases and has been in prison for more than a year after being sentenced in a graft case. Imran Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases. Published - September 16, 2024 05:13 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Pakistan / World / politics",

            "content": "Eating an apple first thing in the morning on an empty stomach can improve your health. Fibre, antioxidants, and polyphenols found in apples promote gut flora, aid in digestion, and heighten feelings of fullness. Eating an apple first thing will also help manage blood sugar levels, stimulate your metabolism, and provide a natural energy boost to keep you going throughout the morning. Eating the correct breakfast can influence your level of energy and concentration throughout the day.

One of the healthiest habits you can develop is eating an apple on an empty stomach, which has many health advantages that can enhance your general wellbeing. Enhances Digestive Wellness Apples are an excellent source of dietary fiber, especially pectin, a soluble fiber that aids with digestive system regulation. Constipation can be avoided by eating an apple first thing in the morning, which stimulates the digestive system and encourages regular bowel movements. In addition to its beneficial effects on intestinal health and toxin removal from the body, fiber also serves as a natural detoxifier. Boosts Vitality Natural sugars found in abundance in apples, such as fructose and glucose, give off a continuous energy boost without the crash that many coffees cause. Because of the fruit's fiber content, these sugars are absorbed more slowly, providing a more consistent energy supply for the duration of the morning. Eating an apple first thing in the morning guarantees that your body receives its natural energy boost without the need for processed sweets or caffeine. Encourages Loss of Weight Eating an apple in the morning can help you maintain a healthy weight or lose a few pounds. Apples are high in water and fiber and low in calories, which helps you feel satiated for longer. This can reduce the need for a mid-morning snack and stop overindulging later in the day. Furthermore, apple fiber lowers blood sugar and prevents unexpected rises in hunger. Enhances Immunity and Skin Apples are known to support good skin and strengthen the immune system because they are high in vitamins A and C. Vitamin A promotes immune system and eye health, while vitamin C helps produce collagen, which keeps your skin tight and youthful.

            "content": "India defeated South Korea in the second semifinal of the Asian Champions Trophy 2024 on Monday, September 16. The Harmanpreet Singh-led side made light work of the Koreans to register a 4-1 win and make their way into the tournament's final for the sixth time. The Men in Blue will face hosts China in the final on Tuesday, September 17. India began well with an attack in the early minutes. Abhishek made an entry into the Korean D in the fourth minute but his effort was saved. In the very next minute, Uttam gave a good ball to Raheel, whose cut was saved by the Korean goalkeeper as they somehow managed to keep the score 0-0. But the constant attacks paid dividends when Araijeet Hundal's square pass went to Uttam Singh, who put the ball into the goal to take India 1-0 over the Koreans in the 10th minute. They kept the intensity going and found the second goal from Indian captain Harmanpreet Singh, who converted a penalty corner into a goal in the 19th minute. While the Koreans looked to challenge the defending champions a few times, there was hardly any stopping for the Men in Blue. At the start of the third quarter, Jarmanpreet found another goal. He received a brilliant aerial from Sumit and then slapped the ball past the Korean goal-saver to make it 3-0. The Koreans got on board soon off a penalty corner. Yang Ji-hun took the drag flick and sent it to the left of the Indian goalkeeper Krishan Pathak, who got a pad to the ball in an attempt to stop. But the ball deflected to the nets off his pads to get Korea on board at 3-1. The two teams traded chances for the rest of the quarter as Sukhjeet missed a sitter before Hyun Jig-wang failed to find the target when he looked for deflection in the Indian goal. India got another penalty corner in the dying moments of the third quarter and the champion drag flicker Harmanpreet stepped up again to score his second goal of the match. The final quarter saw India keep the possession superbly, defying the Koreans of any major chances and when they got a penalty corner, they did not make the most of it as the Men in Blue clinched the win. China had earlier defeated Pakistan in the first semifinal on penalties and would look to challenge the defending champions and Olympic Games bronze medallists in the final.",

            "content": "The people of Kalyana Karnataka region are pinning high hopes on the State Cabinet meeting in Kalaburagi district on September 17. They hope it will explore solutions to the long-standing problems of the most backward region in Karnataka. The last Cabinet meeting held in Kalaburagi to discuss issues related to the region was in 2014 during the first stint of Siddaramaiah as the Chief Minister. It is hard for people of the region to believe that a cabinet meeting in Kalaburagi will change things for the better any time soon, as the region had gained little from the six cabinet meetings held in the city so far. The Cabinet meeting on September 17 is likely to discuss some important issues, including the long-pending irrigation projects in the districts. Farmers leaders say that some of the projects, like Bhima lift irrigation, Amarja irrigation projection, Gandorinala irrigation project, Bennethora Project, Upper Mullamari and Lower Mullamari projects, were taken up nearly five decades ago, but are yet to be completed due to lack of political will. They also allege that some have technical flaws leading to water not reaching the tail-end farms. At the Cabinet meeting held in Kalaburagi in November 2014, a decision was taken to fill up nearly 50,000 vacant posts in various departments in Kalyana Karnataka region. Ministers had assured to complete the recruitment process by June 2015. However, the decision is yet to be implemented. As of now, nearly 1,09,416 posts were sanctioned in various government departments in the seven districts of the region under Article 371(J) of the Constitution, of which 79,990 posts were filled, which means that 29,426 posts are vacant. The Cabinet could discuss sanctioning the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kalaburagi, establishment of Skill Centres at Kalaburagi and Koppal districts, and Skill Park in Ballari district. Besides completing the old lift irrigation projects in the region, the Cabinet is expected to give approval for new lift irrigation projects in Koppal and Kalaburagi districts. The Cabinet could also allocate more funds for much-awaited projects, such as Tur Dal Park, Mega Textile Park, Kalyana Patha scheme (construction of 1,000 km roads in rural areas), and land acquisition for the Second Ring Road in Kalaburagi city. Development of Sannati Buddhist site, situated near Kanaganahalli, and ancient Nagavi University; and setting up a tourism circuit covering temples and historical sites, including Kanaganahali, Nagavi, Anjanadri Hills, forts in Kalaburagi, Malkhed and Bidar, and Chandrampalli dam would also be discussed. The Cabinet is likely to approve the establishment of new primary health centres, additional police stations and construction of Mini Vidhana Soudhas in the 18 newly formed taluks in the Kalyana Karnataka region. The first Cabinet meeting in Kalaburagi was held by the then Chief Minister late R. Gundu Rao in 1981. Former Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa held Cabinet meetings in Kalaburagi in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The Jagadish Shettar-led government held one meeting in 2012.

SEBI issued a statement on September 4, clarifying its positions on the employees\u2019 demands in the matter of increased HRA among a list of 16 demands. The statement said that the new demands of the SEBI employees would add another \u20b96 lakhs to their CTC, which already is about \u20b934 lakhs, for grade A officers. Moreover, the officers\u2019 claimed unprofessional work culture to which SEBI said that that such claims were \u201cmisplaced\u201d and that the junior officers had been \u201cbeen receiving messages from external elements outside their group, effectively instigating them to ...go to media, go to the Ministry, go to Board..., perhaps to serve their own purpose\u201d the regulator said in its September 4 press release. Following this, employees of SEBI staged a silent protest for about 90 minutes within the office premises on September 5. Details of the demands and the response of the leadership to the protests is not known. About two weeks after the protest, SEBI chose to withdraw the press release saying that all concerns shall be amicably addressed thorough internal channels.

What bitter sweet emotion it is for someone who is proud to be a part of this film.\" Remarkably, at the 64th National Film Awards, Pink won in the category of Best Film on Other Social Issues.

            "content": "On the 8th anniversary of 'Pink', producer Shoojit Sircar reiterates that the film's true audience is men and boys. New Delhi: As the critically acclaimed film 'Pink' marks its 8th anniversary, it remains a significant cultural touchstone, sparking discussions on gender dynamics and societal norms. Directed by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury and produced by Shoojit Sircar, the film has continued to resonate with audiences and critics alike, thanks to its compelling narrative and powerful performances. Starring Amitabh Bachchan as Deepak Sehgal, a retired lawyer, and Taapsee Pannu as Minal Arora, a young woman embroiled in a legal struggle, 'Pink' offers a nuanced examination of consent and gender equality. Sircar, who served as both the producer and creative director, played a crucial role in shaping the film's impactful message. In a revealing old interview from the film\u2019s release period, Sircar elucidated the true aim of 'Pink'. \u201cPink is not a women\u2019s empowerment film, it is a simple narrative of three women. This film is not for the women, who go through such experiences every single day, it\u2019s for the men and the boys,\u201d Sircar emphasized. His vision was to mirror societal attitudes and challenge the perspectives of those who might not directly confront these issues in their daily lives. The film's ongoing relevance underscores Sircar\u2019s commitment to provoking thought and fostering dialogue through cinema. As he reflects on Pink\u2019s legacy, Sircar remains focused on producing thought-provoking content. His upcoming project, an untitled film featuring Abhishek Bachchan, is slated for a global release on November 15, 2024.",

            "description": "Taliban suspends polio vaccination in Afghanistan, hindering global eradication efforts and risking spread of disease",
            "content": "The Taliban have suspended polio vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan, the U.N. said Monday (September 16, 2024). Afghanistan is one of two countries in which the spread of the potentially fatal, paralysing disease has never been stopped. The other is Pakistan. News of the suspension was relayed to U.N. agencies right before the September immunisation campaign was due to start. No reason was given for the suspension, and no one from the Taliban-controlled government was immediately available for comment. A top official from the World Health Organization said it was aware of discussions to move away from house-to-house vaccinations and instead have immunisations in places like mosques. The WHO has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year, all but two in the south of the country. That\u2019s up from six cases in 2023. \u201cThe Global Polio Eradication Initiative is aware of the recent policy discussions on shifting from house-to-house polio vaccination campaigns to site-to-site vaccination in parts of Afghanistan,\u201d said Dr. Hamid Jafari from the WHO. \u201cPartners are in the process of discussing and understanding the scope and impact of any change in current policy.\u201d Anti-polio campaigns in neighbouring Pakistan are regularly marred by violence. Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilise children. The suspension of the September campaign is a blow for the eradication of polio in Afghanistan. As recently as August, the WHO reported that Afghanistan and Pakistan were continuing to implement an \u201cintensive and synchronised campaign\u201d focusing on improved vaccination coverage in endemic zones and an effective and timely response to detections elsewhere. \u201cDuring a June 2024 nationwide campaign, Afghanistan used a house-to-house vaccination strategy for the first time in five years, a tactic that helped to reach the majority of children targeted,\u201d the WHO said. But southern Kandahar province, the base of Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, used site-to-site or mosque-to-mosque vaccination campaigns, which are less effective than going to people\u2019s homes. Kandahar continues to have a large pool of susceptible children because it is not carrying out house-to-house vaccinations, the WHO said. \u201cThe overall women\u2019s inclusion in vaccination campaigns remains around 20% in Afghanistan, leading to inadequate access to all children in some areas,\u201d it said. \u201cAny setback in Afghanistan poses a risk to the program in Pakistan due to high population movement,\u201d the WHO warned last month. The campaign suspension is the latest obstacle in what has become a problematic global effort to stop polio. The initiative, which costs about $1 billion every year, has missed multiple deadlines to wipe out the disease and technical mistakes in the vaccination strategy set by WHO and partners have been costly. The oral vaccine has also inadvertently seeded outbreaks in dozens of countries across Africa, Asia and the Middle East and now accounts for the majority of polio cases worldwide. This was seen most recently in Gaza, where a baby was partially paralysed by a mutated strain of polio first seen in the oral vaccine, marking the territory\u2019s first case in more than 25 years.

            "content": "Sitting in a dark room, a three-dimensional soundscape gets you to enter Josef K\u2019s world. Armed with high-quality wireless headphones, you experience sounds as if they\u2019re all around you \u2014 footsteps from behind, whispers from the side and the bustle of a courtroom. Welcome to I, Josef , a 45-minute deeply immersive and thought-provoking multimedia experience that invites audiences to slip into the shoes of Franz Kafka\u2019s most well-known character, who gets unexpectedly arrested and put on trial for an unspecified crime. This adaptation of Kafka\u2019s Der Prozess ( The Trial ) is re-imagined through a unique first-person perspective that immerses the listener into K\u2019s world through binaural audio. Presented by Kaivalya Plays in collaboration with the Goethe Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan, New Delhi, to celebrate #100YearsKafka, it was staged recently in slots with only 30 audience members in attendance at a time. Relevant script Kaivalya Plays\u2019 general manager Gaurav Singh Nijjer has directed and designed the play| Photo Credit:Courtesy: Kaivalya Plays Despite being written over a century ago, The Trial remains strikingly relevant in today\u2019s world, particularly in India. According to Kaivalya Plays\u2019 general manager Gaurav Singh Nijjer, who directed and designed the play, themes of bureaucratic complexity, the struggle for justice and individual freedom in the face of authority are more pertinent than ever. I, Josef aims to bring these themes to life in a visceral way, encouraging audiences to reflect on their own experiences with societal structures and personal freedoms. \u201cThe narrative of an individual suddenly arrested without explanation and entangled in an opaque, unyielding legal system resonates strongly with contemporary experiences. Moreover, the novel\u2019s exploration of isolation and loneliness speaks to our modern condition, where digital connectivity often paradoxically leads to human disconnection,\u201d elaborated Nijjer. Armed with wireless headphones, you can experience every nuance of the play.| Photo Credit:Courtesy: Kaivalya Plays I, Josef is a natural evolution of Kaivalya Plays\u2019 long-standing interest in audio-based theatrical experiences, including radio play adaptations and immersive audio experiences, such as Lifeline 99 99 . \u201cWe wanted to transform the third-person narrative into a direct, first-person encounter that challenges the audience to experience Josef K\u2019s world from within. Throughout the performance, listeners are challenged to engage with Kafka\u2019s themes on a personal level, feeling Josef\u2019s confusion, despair and search for meaning as if they were their own experiences,\u201d said Kaivalya Plays\u2019 artistic director Varoon P. Anand, who scripted and adapted the play. Sound technique Adapting The Trial for binaural audio was a multi-step process. The team first rewrote the narrative to focus on auditory elements, ensuring that characters identify themselves and that actions are described through recognisable sounds. They then created a 3D soundscape using binaural recording techniques, which captured sound as it would be heard by human ears. \u201cThis allows for a fully immersive audio experience where sounds can be perceived as coming from different directions and distances,\u201d explained Anand. Next, the team carefully selected and rehearsed with actors to find the right voices for each character, recording in both English and German. They procured state-of-the-art wireless headphones and other materials for the installation. Finally, they incorporated subtle projection mapping to enhance the overall immersive experience without detracting from the audio narrative. Kaivalya Plays\u2019 artistic director Varoon P. Anand has scripted and adapted the play| Photo Credit:Courtesy: Kaivalya Plays Last month, Kaivalya Plays staged Martin McDonagh\u2019s The Pillowman in the capital. An edge-of-the-seat dark comedy set in an unnamed totalitarian state, it tells the chilling story of a writer whose macabre tales of child murders blur the line between fiction and reality. The visually stimulating performance, which was performed under license from Concord Theatricals, blended different ideas of storytelling, including projection mapping, live transmissions and audio-video interactions with actors in real-time. From Pillowman by Kaivalya Plays| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Kaivalya Plays plans to continue exploring innovative theatrical formats. Next month, they will present their two-year research on safety in the performing arts and artificial intelligence at the India Foundation for the Arts Research Conference in Bengaluru. In November, they will help a group of young artistes to debut as directors on the Delhi stage with a new self-written production The Golden Commode . They will also stage Mining Hate , an improvised interactive play about the disinformation attacks on Indian journalists that uses AI tools in real time. Further, their new improv team will stage Conspiracy Theory , a long-form improv comedy show about conspiracy theories. Apart from this, they will host workshops by artistes from Australia and Germany this month, bringing more opportunities for Indian artistes to learn from global performers, especially in the area of technology for theatre. \u201cWe envision creating performances that can travel beyond traditional arts spaces, entering classrooms, offices, courtrooms and even the Internet,\u201d concluded Nijjer.

            "content": "KL Rahul\u2019s future with Lucknow Super Giants remains uncertain as rumors suggest a potential return to Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction. KL Rahul\u2019s animated interaction with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owner Sanjeev Goenka during the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season has sparked speculation about the star batter's future with the franchise. Despite Goenka describing Rahul as \"family,\" questions surrounding his retention remain, especially with the highly anticipated mega auction ahead of IPL 2025. Rumors Linking Rahul to Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) I'm happy that KL Rahul knows about the rumours that are going around for him & RCB. Please boss change your IPL team! pic.twitter.com/Os06Uj39gQ Adding to the intrigue, rumors have emerged suggesting that Rahul might part ways with LSG and rejoin his former team, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). Rahul played for RCB for four seasons from 2013 to 2016, and speculation about a possible return intensified after a viral social media clip. In the video, an RCB fan asked Rahul about the rumors of him joining the Bangalore-based team, to which Rahul responded with a cryptic, \"Let's hope so.\" This brief but telling response has fueled further talks of Rahul potentially switching teams, especially as RCB could be on the lookout for a key player in the upcoming auction. Sanjeev Goenka\u2019s Take on KL Rahul Sanjeev Goenka, during the unveiling of Zaheer Khan as LSG\u2019s new team mentor last month, addressed the rumors surrounding Rahul\u2019s future. Speaking to the media, Goenka emphasized his close relationship with the LSG captain: \u201cI've been meeting KL regularly over the last three years. I'm a little surprised this meeting got so much attention. As I've said, we have not taken any call till the retention rules are out.\u201d Goenka reiterated Rahul\u2019s importance to the team, saying, \u201cKL has been an integral and important part of the LSG family since inception. He's played a very important role. He's like family and will always be family.\u201d Retention and Captaincy Decisions Await BCCI Guidelines As the IPL retention rules for the 2025 season have not yet been announced, no formal decisions regarding player retention or leadership have been made. Goenka confirmed this, adding, \"We are waiting for the BCCI to release the retention rules. We have all of September, October, and November to decide that. Let the policies be out. We have not even thought about the team going forward, whether retention will be three, four, five, or six. We have no clue.\" As the 2025 IPL auction draws near, Rahul\u2019s future with LSG remains uncertain. While Goenka\u2019s statements highlight the strong bond between the franchise and its captain, the upcoming auction and retention policies will ultimately decide whether Rahul stays with Lucknow or seeks a fresh start with another team, perhaps even RCB. For now, fans and cricket experts alike eagerly await further announcements, with the mega auction likely to play a pivotal role in determining KL Rahul\u2019s next move in the IPL.",

            "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (September 16, 2024) inaugurated phase II of the Metro rail extension connecting the twin cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. Mr. Modi waved a green flag to start the new route and travelled in the Metro from Sector 1 station of Gandhinagar to GIFT city. Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat and Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel accompanied the Prime Minister on his metro journey, during which he interacted with students and other passengers. As per a government release, part one of phase II spans up to 21 kilometres, covering eight new stations initially, providing efficient transportation services. The project, developed by the Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) in collaboration with the state and Central governments, will expand the metro network, linking key locations between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, such as GNLU, PDEU, Gift City, Raysan, Randesan, Dholakuva, Infocity and Sector-1, it said. The new phase from Motera to Gandhinagar's Sector 1 will connect crucial hubs such as GIFT City, facilitating easy access for professionals, students, and tourists. The total project cost for phase II was \u20b95,384 crore, with funding secured through loans from international agencies like AFD and KfW. The extended route dramatically reduces the travel time between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. For instance, commuters can travel between APMC and GIFT City in under an hour at Rs 35. Ahmedabad city has two metro corridors. With this extension of the Metro from Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar, a major connectivity problem between the twin cities has been resolved.

            "content": "Addressing a gathering, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the speed of movement of files is directly proportional to the weight (money) on them. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari is known for his outspoken attitude. He never holds his horses back when it comes to exposing laxity within the government system. Addressing a gathering on the occasion of 'Engineer's Day' in Pune, Gadkari exposed the prevalent corruption within the bureaucracy while saying that files move faster if there is weight on them. Gadkari was talking about bribes given by people to get files approved. The Union Minister said that the speed of movement of files is directly proportional to the weight (money) on them. Gadkari was talking about issues related to the need for transparency and time-bound decision-making in the government system. Addressing the gathering in which the majority of the government employees were in attendance, Gadkari said that bureaucrats work faster in cases where they get money. \"There are some 'Newton's fathers' in our system and files move faster only if you put more weight on it,\" said Gadkari. | Addressing Engineers Day program organised by Alumni Association of COEP Technological University. https://t.co/G8bh0bfPLM \u2014 Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) September 15, 2024 Using highway projects and road accidents as an example, Gadkari noted that the primary cause of these issues stems from flawed detailed project reports (DPRs), rather than any other factor. Additionally, he pointed out that some bureaucrats require directives for even basic tasks, such as filling potholes on roads. The Union Minister announced that his ministry has planned a 14-lane highway connecting Mumbai and Bengaluru, starting from the Atal Setu Bridge and linking with Pune's ring road. He explained that this will allow travelers from Mumbai to Bengaluru to bypass Pune, helping to reduce traffic in the city. Additionally, the route will provide direct access to Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. \"A tender has already been floated, and we aim to begin construction within the next six months,\" he added.",

            "content": "In a controversial statement, Shiv Sena (Eknath) MLA Sanjay Gaikwad on Monday announced to give Rs 11 lakh to anyone for cutting off Congress leader \u2019s tongue for his remarks on scrapping the reservation system. In his bizarre statement, Gaikwad said, \u201cWhile he was abroad, Rahul Gandhi said that he wants to finish off the reservation system in India. This has exposed the true face of the Congress.\u201d \"During his recent US visit, Rahul Gandhi talked about ending reservations. It shows the mindset that is inherently opposed to reservations. I will reward anyone who cuts off Rahul Gandhi's tongue with Rs 11 lakh,\u201d Gaikwad added. Gaikwad further called Gandhi's statement as treachery. He said, \"Gandhi's comments are the biggest treachery of the people. Communities like Marathas, Dhangars and OBCs are fighting for reservation but before that, Gandhi is talking about ending its benefits.\" Continuing to lash out at Congress, Gaikwad said, \"Rahul Gandhi used to show the Constitution book and spread fake narrative that the BJP would change it. But it is the Congress that plans to take the country back by 400 years.\" Gaikwad's statement has drawn sharp criticism from the opposition. Shiv Sena's allaince partner BJP has also distanced itself from his statement. Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule said he does not support the MLA\u2019s remarks. \"I will not support or endorse Gaikwad's comments. However, we cannot forget that the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had opposed reservations saying it would affect the progress,\" said Bawankule. \u201cRajiv Gandhi had said giving reservations means supporting idiots. Now Rahul Gandhi says he would end reservations,\u201d the BJP leader said. \"We will sensitise the SCs, STs and OBCs and inform them about the comments of Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Even Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange should think about it,\" he said. Lambasting Gaikwad, Atul Londhe, spokesperson of Maharashtra Congress said, \"Sanjay Gaikwad does not deserve to live in society and politics. We want to see whether Maharashtra Home Minister invokes charges of culpable homicide against Gaikwad.\" Aparty from Londhe, Congress MLC Bhai Jagtap also slammed Gaikwad and said, \"I condemn such people and comments. These people have spoiled the politics of the state.\" It is not the first time that Gaikwad has been surrounded by controversy. Last month, a video of a policeman washing his car had gone viral on social media. Gaikwad later explained that the policeman cleaned the vehicle voluntarily after vomiting inside it. In February this year, he gave another controversial remark saying he had hunted a tiger in 1987 and has been wearing its tooth around his neck. Soon after, the state Forest department sent the purported tiger tooth for forensic identification and charged Gaikwad under the Wildlife Protection Act.",

            "content": "The Railway Board (RB) has approved \u2018re-engagement\u2019 of retired railway officers as \u2018consultants\u2019 in the available vacant posts in both junior and senior categories by the zonal General Managers concerned across the country. In a recent circular issued, the RB acknowledged that zonal railways have been experiencing difficulties because of vacant posts for gazetted officers and the scheme for re-engagement of retired railway officers of those up to 65 years of age has been cleared. The re-appointments will be valid up to December 31, 2026. Responsibilities of the consultants The proposal is to give such consultants responsibilities like inspections, supervision, drawing, etc., but not an independent charge or appoint as a head of a unit. They would not have any financial powers and are not authorised to issue any kind of safety certificates. Such selected \u2018consultant\u2019 officers would receive a fixed monthly remuneration arrived at by deducting the basic pension from the pay drawn at the time of retirement. There will be no annual increment/percentage increase or Dearness Allowance (DA) during the contract period. While the vacant posts and requirements from among the retired personnel will be put on the official website, the competency of the official to be chosen as consultant will be based on the past performance, medical fitness and evaluation by a three-member panel to be constituted by the GM concerned of the zone, said the directive. Re-engaged consultant will not be retained beyond December 31, 2026 Initially, the period of engagement will be only for one year and can be extended based on the requirement. But, no re-engaged consultant will be retained beyond December 31, 2026. Engagement as consultant also cannot be considered as a \u2018case of re-employment\u2019. The \u2018re-engaged\u2019 officer will not be entitled to house rent allowance and residential accommodation. However, transport allowance for the purpose of commuting between residence and the place of work will be provided as also TA/DA during official tours. The consultants will also have to sign an agreement of confidentiality promising not to divulge any information gathered by him/her during the period of assignment related to the organization to anyone who is not authorized to know/have the same. They are also liable to be \u2018discharged immediately\u2019 on joining of selected candidate(s) from UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) or through departmental selection as per the recommendation of head of the department concerned, reads the official directive issued by the RB to the GMs. Published - September 16, 2024 04:29 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Telangana / indian railways",

            "content": "Batting maestro is set to make his return to Test cricket as he gears up for the upcoming two-match series against Bangladesh. After missing the five-match series against England earlier in the year, Kohli would be hungry to make his mark at home in the series that gets underway from September 19 onwards. It has now become a common practice that whenever Kohli steps out, there are some records on offer. The same goes for the India vs Bangladesh Test series. When the Indian star takes the field, he will have his eyes set on three records. The modern master Kohli is a little away from breaking a massive record of in International cricket. Kohli needs just 58 runs to become the fastest player to hit 27000 runs in International cricket, breaking Tendulkar's record of 27K runs in 623 innings. Kohli has made 26942 runs in 591 innings and has all the time in the world to break this record, while Sachin made 27K runs in 623 innings. Meanwhile, the former Indian skipper is on the cusp of registering another major milestone. Kohli needs just 11 runs to reach 12000 International runs at home. He will become just the fifth player with 12K runs at home in the three formats and the only active player to do so. Sachin Tendulkar (14192), Ricky Ponting (13117), Jacques Kallis (12305) and Kumar Sangakkara (12043) are the only players to have breached the mark so far. The batting icon is closing in on another feat in Test cricket. Kohli has made 8848 runs in Test cricket so far and stands on the cusp of getting to 9000 runs in the format. The 35-year-old needs 152 runs to reach the mark, which will make him the fourth Indian to have hit this many runs in the format. Sachin Tendulkar (15921), Rahul Dravid (13288) and Sunil Gavaskar (10122) are the only others in this list. If Virat gets 152 runs in the opening Test, he will also go past Bradman in a major record list. Kohli is tied with Bradman with 29 Test tons and if he gets one more in the opener or in the second one, he will go past the legendary Australian batter.",

Following a recent Supreme Court judge's observation that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should shed its image as a \"caged parrot,\" Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar highlighted the need for cooperation between key state institutions. Speaking at an event in Mumbai, Dhankhar underscored the importance of the Judiciary, Legislature, and Executive working together to safeguard democratic values and uphold the Constitution. \u201cAll organs of the state \u2013 Judiciary, Legislature, and Executive \u2013 have a single purpose: to ensure the success of the fundamental spirit of the Constitution, to guarantee all rights to the common people, and to help India prosper and flourish,\u201d the Vice President said during the inauguration of the Samvidhan Mandir at Elphinstone Technical High School and Junior College. The Vice President underscored that institutions must be aware of their limitations, both obvious and subtle. He warned that inflammatory political debates or narratives that undermine the institutions of the state could harm their ability to function effectively. ''They need to work in tandem and togetherness to nurture and blossom democratic values and further Constitutional ideals.

While granting bail to Kejriwal, Justice Bhuyan noted that in a democracy governed by the rule of law, the perception of institutions matters, and the CBI must be seen as independent. Justice Bhuyan cited an earlier instance where the CBI was compared to a \"caged parrot\" by the Supreme Court, calling for the agency to dispel that image. \u201cIt is imperative that CBI dispels the notion of it being a caged parrot. Rather, the perception should be that of an uncaged parrot,\u201d he wrote in his judgment. Political Backlash The \"caged parrot\" comment triggered a political backlash, with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) launching a scathing attack on the central government and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Delhi Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj questioned Shah\u2019s leadership, stating that the Supreme Court's criticism of the CBI raised concerns about the Union Home Ministry's oversight of the agency. \"The Union home minister should resign as this raises questions on him. The Supreme Court called the CBI a caged parrot,\" Bharadwaj stated, adding fuel to the ongoing political debate",

            "content": "Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Monday (September 16, 2024) lashed out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre over the 'one nation, one election' issue , saying it is not possible under the present Constitution and requires at least five Constitutional amendments. Replying to a question on reports that the BJP-led NDA government would implement 'one nation, one election' within its current tenure, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have the numbers to place those constitutional amendments either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. One Nation, One Election: Do States get a say in constitutional amendments? | Explained In his Independence Day address last month, the prime minister made a strong pitch for 'one nation, one election', contending that frequent polls were creating hurdles in the country's progress. Addressing reporters here, Chidambaram said, \"'One nation, one election' is not possible under the present Constitution. It requires at least five constitutional amendments.\" \"Mr Modi does not have the majority to put those constitutional amendments in either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha,\" the former Union minister said. He asserted that there were greater constitutional obstacles to 'one nation, one election'. \"It is not possible. The INDIA bloc is totally opposed to 'One Nation, One Election.\" To a question on PM Modi recently alleging that the Congress wanted to end reservation, Chidambaram rejected the charge. \"Why should we abolish reservation?\" he asked rhetorically. \"We are the ones who are saying that the reservation ceiling of 50 per cent must be removed. We are the ones who are asking for a caste census. We are saying reservation must be according to the population. Do not believe everything the prime minister says,\" he told the reporters. At a rally in Kurukshetra on September 15, Prime Minister Modi had lashed out at the Congress, alleging its \"royal family\" intended to end reservation for Dalits and asserted that as long as he was there, he would not let even a fraction of reservation given by B R Ambedkar be looted or removed. At the media interaction here on Monday Chidambaram was asked if the Congress would announce its chief ministerial face for the October 5 Haryana assembly polls. He said that normally, the Congress does not announce a CM candidate before the polls. \"The practice is that elections take place, MLAs gather and their preferences are asked. Then the high command announces who will be the chief minister. I think the same practice will be followed in Haryana,\" he said. The senior Congress leader hit out at the BJP government in the state over several issues, including unemployment, agriculture and state debt. He appealed to the people to vote for the Congress in the Assembly elections and promised that his party would bring back Haryana's growth rate, give a fillip to development, agriculture, and industry, and tackle issues of unemployment and inflation. \"The BJP boasts of a double-engine government. One engine is without fuel and the other is completely broken down. What is the use of such a double-engine government? The time has come to junk the two engines,\" Chidambaram said.

PM Modi is all set to celebrate his 73rd birthday on Tuesday. BJP leader Purnesh Modi said that several local businesses in his constituency will offer discounts ranging from 10 percent to 100 percent to celebrate Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday. He said that this tradition, where service activities are held, has been observed every year to honour the Prime Minister. Businesses from various sectors, including hotels, restaurants, clinics, vegetable markets, and bakeries, will participate in the initiative. \"In my constituency, every year we do some work in service on PM Modi's birthday... 2,500 businessmen involved in different occupations will provide discounts ranging between 10% to 100%... 110 auto-rickshaws will give 100% discount on that day. We appeal it every year, but we don't force anyone for any kind of offer. They are connected to us and PM Modi with their will... every shop has its own scheme--what to discount, how much discount--it's their decision. It's voluntary; we just connect them with the people,\" Purnesh Modi said. The Auto Union in Surat said it is joining the celebration. Raju Bhandari, the union president, said, \"We will celebrate as seva day (service day), where individual auto drivers are giving [rides for free]. Why not do it as a united move? Hence, we will take passengers for free, and that is on Monday, September 16, a day ahead of Narendra Modi's birthday.\" Shoppers in Surat are also excited about the discounts being offered during the festive season. One shopper said, \"Today, festivals are going on, so we are shopping. I came to know that on September 17, it's PM Modi's birthday, and we are getting good discounts here. So, we bought a few items.\" PM Narendra Modi on his birthday will visit Odisha to initiate the 'Subhadra Yojana.' BJP MP Sambit Patra had earlier said, \"During the election campaign, PM Modi provided a 'Modi Guarantee' in Odisha, promising that if the BJP formed the government, every woman would receive Rs 50,000 over five years. The process begins on September 17, with around 1 crore 30 lakh women set to receive the first installment of Rs 5,000 through the Subhadra Yojana. PM Modi will release this first installment.\"",

            "content": "World Alzheimer\u2019s Day, observed on September 21, aims to raise awareness, support research, and advocate for better care and policies to address the global impact of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. World Alzheimer\u2019s Day, observed annually on September 21, serves as a global platform to raise awareness about Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. This day is dedicated to highlighting the challenges faced by individuals living with dementia, their families, and caregivers while promoting research, education, and support initiatives aimed at combating this debilitating condition. The Importance of World Alzheimer\u2019s Day Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common form of dementia, is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It predominantly affects older adults, though early-onset cases can occur. With millions of people worldwide living with Alzheimer\u2019s or a related dementia, World Alzheimer\u2019s Day plays a crucial role in bringing attention to the impact of these diseases. Raising Awareness The primary goal of World Alzheimer\u2019s Day is to educate the public about Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. By increasing awareness, the day helps to dispel myths and misconceptions, fosters understanding, and encourages compassionate support for those affected. Awareness campaigns often focus on the signs and symptoms of dementia, the importance of early diagnosis, and the need for effective care and support systems. Supporting Research Research into Alzheimer\u2019s disease is vital for understanding its causes, developing effective treatments, and ultimately finding a cure. World Alzheimer\u2019s Day highlights the ongoing research efforts and calls for increased funding and support for scientific studies. Advances in research can lead to better diagnostic tools, innovative therapies, and improved quality of life for individuals living with dementia. Advocating for Policy Change World Alzheimer\u2019s Day also emphasizes the need for policy changes that can enhance the lives of those affected by dementia. This includes advocating for better healthcare services, support for caregivers, and initiatives to make communities more dementia-friendly. Policymakers, healthcare professionals, and organizations use this day to push for changes that address the needs of people with dementia and their families. Supporting Caregivers Caregivers play a crucial role in the lives of individuals with dementia. World Alzheimer\u2019s Day acknowledges their challenges and provides an opportunity to offer support and resources. Caregiving can be physically and emotionally demanding, and providing caregivers with the tools and support they need is essential for maintaining their well-being and the quality of care for those they support. Activities and Observances On World Alzheimer\u2019s Day, various activities take place around the globe, including: - Awareness Campaigns: Events such as seminars, workshops, and public talks are organized to educate people about Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. These events may feature guest speakers, informational booths, and interactive sessions. - Fundraising Events: Many organizations host fundraising events to support Alzheimer\u2019s research and care initiatives. These events can include charity walks, galas, and auctions. - Community Engagement: Communities often engage in activities to make their environments more dementia-friendly. This can include creating awareness programs, offering training for businesses and public services, and fostering social inclusion. - Media Outreach: Media campaigns, including social media posts, articles, and interviews, help spread awareness and engage a broader audience. These campaigns often feature personal stories from individuals and families affected by dementia. World Alzheimer\u2019s Day is more than just a day of recognition; it is a call to action for increased awareness, research, and support for those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. By coming together on this day, individuals, communities, and organizations contribute to the global effort to improve the lives of those living with dementia and work towards a future where the impact of these diseases is significantly reduced.",

            "content": "On the occasion of Hindi Diwas, the governments of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have made an important decision for the upcoming healthcare professionals. After the Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh, both state governments have announced that from the current academic session 2024-25, MBBS will be taught in Hindi within the state. This implementation has been taken in view of the special importance being given by the central government to the Hindi language. The Rajasthan government has decided to introduce the language in phases whereby two medical colleges in the state will adopt the changes from this year's academic session. The names of these colleges are Sampurnanand Medical College of Jodhpur and Medical College of Barmer affiliated under the Marwar Medical University. Chhattisgarh has also announced that the implementation of the new changes will be done from the first year of the 2024-25 session. This decision has been taken to provide benefits to the students who mostly come from Hindi medium schools and face difficulties in medical courses due to the language barrier. 'Studying in Hindi will strengthen their fundamentals, help them to develop a deeper understanding of the subject, and enable them to become better doctors, said Chief Minister Vishnu Dev Sai. The medical aspirants will have a choice to select their preferred language. The introduction of Hindi in medical education was also part of the state's budget. The announcement of MBBS courses in Hindi for Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand was made last year. This came after Union Home Minister Amit Shah unveiled the Hindi MBBS course books in October 2022, which were the first to be published in Hindi. The Bihar government also said in July that Hindi-language Bachelor of Medicine, and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) programmes would be available. On July 2, State Health Minister Mangal Pandey announced that beginning with the next session, students would be able to study MBBS in Hindi.",

Addressing party workers just days after being released on bail from Tihar Jail in connection with the excise policy corruption case, Kejriwal declared on Sunday that he would only resume his role as Chief Minister after the people vouch for his honesty. \"I will sit in the Chief Minister's chair only when the people give me a certificate of honesty,\" he stated. He further added, \"I will become Chief Minister, and Sisodia will become Deputy CM only when the people say we are honest.\"",

            "content": "The withdrawal came days after a protest by a large number of Sebi employees outside the regulator's headquarters on September 5, a day after the press release. They had demanded the withdrawal of the statement and the resignation of Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch. New Delhi: Capital markets regulator Sebi on Monday withdrew its press release issued in September 4, which addressed claims of unprofessional work culture, stating that these concerns are \"misplaced\" and reaffirmed that employee-related issues will be managed internally. The withdrawal came days after a protest by a large number of Sebi employees outside the regulator's headquarters on September 5, a day after the press release. They had demanded the withdrawal of the statement and the resignation of Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch. In a statement on Monday, Sebi acknowledged the critical role its employees have played over the past thirty-six years in shaping the Indian securities market into one of the most dynamic and well-regulated markets globally. Sebi said it addresses employee-related matters through appropriate internal mechanisms. \"Following constructive discussions with representatives of all grades of officers, Sebi and its employees have reaffirmed that such issues are strictly internal and will be managed in accordance with the organization's high standards of governance and within a time-bound framework,\" the regulator said. Accordingly, the press release issued on September 4 has been withdrawn. The decision to retract the press release came after employees strongly condemned the unauthorized dissemination of internal communications. Sebi employees have reiterated their commitment to resolving concerns amicably through established internal channels, ensuring that such matters remain internal and managed within a time-bound framework. \"Employees have strongly condemned the unauthorized release of internal communication and have confirmed that all concerns shall be addressed amicably through established internal channels,\" the statement noted. For Puri, protests and internal issues have come at a time when she is probably facing the most challenging times in her stint. The career banker-turned-regulator is battling speculations on whether a conflict of interest made her go slow on the probe against Adani Group and a raft of other allegations around it. In what is unprecedented for any financial regulator, around 500 employees wrote to the Finance Ministry on August 6, against the top management, for what they called a \"toxic\" work environment, which includes instances of public humiliation and shouting down. After the publishing of a media report about the letter, Sebi responded with a press release, which stated such claims are \"misplaced\", which seemed to have irked the employees. The regulator stated that some \"external elements\" had instigated its employees into believing that they shouldn't be held to high standards of performance and accountability, though, it did not provide specific details.",

            "content": "Bollywood and Tollywood actors Aditi Rao Hydari and Siddharth tied the knot on Monday morning in an intimate wedding in Telangana. The couple opted for a simple South Indian wedding at Sri Ranganayakaswamy temple. The nuptials took place in the presence of their close friends and family. The newlyweds also took to Instagram to share the heartwarming photos from their wedding. Where Aditi chose a Sabyasachi tissue organza lehenga with intricate golden zari embroidery. Siddharth, on the other hand, complemented the bride beautifully with an intricately crafted traditional Veshti bottom and a classic kurta with subtle embroidery. But do you know it was not an easy journey for Sid and Aditi to find their way to each other? Aditi Rao Hydari and Siddharth, both come from a broken marriage experience. Yes! you read that right, the actors were earlier married to other people and had to deal with divorces. The Heeramandi actor was married to actor Satyadeep Mishra, who is now married to fashion designer Masaba Gupta. The couple is now expecting their first child together. According to an earlier interview, Aditi and Satyadeep married in a private ceremony in 2007 when she was only 21 years old. In 2013, she revealed that they had split up, without disclosing the reason behind their divorce. On the other hand, the Rang De Basanti actor previously married Meghna Narayan in November 2003 after falling in love while growing up in the same neighbourhood in New Delhi. Siddharth and his former wife separated in early 2006 and were officially divorced in January 2007. Aditi Rao Hydari and Siddharth met on the set of 'Maha Samudram', a 2021 Telugu film. According to sources, their on-screen chemistry in this action-packed love drama translated into real life, with the two developing a close friendship while filming. They became inseparable over time, frequently seen together on public occasions and referred to one another as 'partners.' Their chemistry was evident, and viewers instantly speculated about the real-life romance happening behind the scenes. Rumours regarding their dating status spread quickly among media outlets. However, Aditi and Siddharth have always kept their relationship private, preferring not to discuss it publically until they exchanged rings in March 2024. Now the couple is officially married and is embarking upon a new journey in their lives.",

Gulabgarh:Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday said there were attempts to revive terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, and added that it will be \"buried to such a level\" in the Union territory that it can never rise again. Shah, speaking at a public rally in Kishtwar, said the National Conference-Congress alliance will not be able to form the J-K government. \u201cWe will bury terrorism to such a level where it will never come out again. Attempts are on to revive terrorism as the National Conference and Congress manifesto talks about releasing terrorists. This is the Modi government and nobody has the power to revive terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d Shah said addressing an election rally in Padder-Nagseni assembly segment in support of BJP\u2019s candidate and former minister Sunil Sharma here. \u201cThis election is between two powers, on one side National Conference and PDP and on the other BJP. The NC-Congress are saying that if we form the government we will restore Article 370. Tell me should it be restored? Your reservation, given by BJP to Paharis and Gujjars and others, will be snatched. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I am watching the situation in Kashmir and be assured that neither Abdullah\u2019s nor Rahul\u2019s party are going to form the government in J-K,\u201d the home minister said. This was the home minister\u2019s second visit to Jammu region within a fortnight. Earlier, during his two-day visit to Jammu on September 6 and 7, he released BJP\u2019s manifesto for J-K assembly elections and addressed a workers convention. Monday is the last day for campaigning in 24 assembly constituencies, including Padder-Nagseni, which goes to polls in the first phase on September 18.",

            "content": "Chidambaram said Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have the numbers to place those constitutional amendments either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. Chandigarh: Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday lashed out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre over the 'one nation, one election' issue, saying it is not possible under the present Constitution and requires at least five constitutional amendments. Replying to a question on reports that the BJP-led NDA government would implement 'one nation, one election' within its current tenure, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have the numbers to place those constitutional amendments either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. In his Independence Day address last month, the prime minister made a strong pitch for 'one nation, one election', contending that frequent polls were creating hurdles in the country's progress. Addressing reporters here, Chidambaram said, \"'One nation, one election' is not possible under the present Constitution. It requires at least five constitutional amendments.\" \"Mr Modi does not have the majority to put those constitutional amendments in either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha,\" the former Union minister said. He asserted that there were greater constitutional obstacles to 'one nation, one election'. \"It is not possible. The INDIA bloc is totally opposed to 'One Nation, One Election.\" To a question on PM Modi recently alleging that the Congress wanted to end reservation, Chidambaram rejected the charge. \"Why should we abolish reservation?\" he asked rhetorically. \"We are the ones who are saying that the reservation ceiling of 50 per cent must be removed. We are the ones who are asking for a caste census. We are saying reservation must be according to the population. Do not believe everything the prime minister says,\" he told the reporters. At a rally in Kurukshetra on September 15, Prime Minister Modi had lashed out at the Congress, alleging its \"royal family\" intended to end reservation for Dalits and asserted that as long as he was there, he would not let even a fraction of reservation given by B R Ambedkar be looted or removed. At the media interaction here on Monday Chidambaram was asked if the Congress would announce its chief ministerial face for the October 5 Haryana assembly polls. He said that normally, the Congress does not announce a CM candidate before the polls. \"The practice is that elections take place, MLAs gather and their preferences are asked. Then the high command announces who will be the chief minister. I think the same practice will be followed in Haryana,\" he said. The senior Congress leader hit out at the BJP government in the state over several issues, including unemployment, agriculture and state debt. He appealed to the people to vote for the Congress in the Assembly elections and promised that his party would bring back Haryana's growth rate, give a fillip to development, agriculture, and industry, and tackle issues of unemployment and inflation. \"The BJP boasts of a double-engine government. One engine is without fuel and the other is completely broken down. What is the use of such a double-engine government? The time has come to junk the two engines,\" Chidambaram said.",

            "content": "The Nilgiris forest division has deployed personnel from the forest department to prevent tourists and local residents from disturbing the gregarious flowering of Strobilanthes (Neelakurinji) plants near Udhagamandalam. The blooming of the Strobilanthes species, believed to be Strobilanthes kunthiana has been reported from two parts of the Nilgiris \u2013 near Udhagamandalam and Kotagiri, officials said. As word spreads about the synchronous flowering, many tourists and local residents, hoping to take a picture of the mass flowering have been trying to ascertain the location. Divisional Forest Officer (Nilgiris), S. Gowtham, said that one the sites where the Neelakurinji have bloomed was located within a reserve forest in the Nilgiris forest division. \u201cAs such, people are not permitted to venture into the area, and could face stiff penalties for doing so,\u201d warned Mr. Gowtham. He however added that the other site near Kotagiri was located on the side of a road, and that people, as long as they do not disturb the area, were free to take pictures there. People have also been warned against plucking the flowers. Officials stated that local residents near the site in Ooty, claimed that the last gregarious flowering of the species in the area was in 2012, which could possibly point to the species being Strobilanthes kunthiana . The forest department has not yet collected any specimens from the site, but are considering doing so, as part of their initiative to help propagate the species in their venture to restore native grasslands in the Nilgiris. Local conservationists stated that the forest department should begin making records of the occurrence of Strobilanthes species in the district, so that they can be compared in subsequent years to ascertain whether the species\u2019 ranges were contracting or were remaining stable. \u201cThere have also been instances in the past, where government departments have pushed ahead with infrastructure work within areas where the species were located. These records could help ensure that such loss of habitat to developmental works are prevented,\u201d said the conservationist.

            "content": "Soon after inaugurating the much-awaited metro rail extension from Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar, PM Modi traveled onboard the metro rail, interacted with passengers. Earlier in the day, he flagged off the 20.8 km long corridor of the Ahmedabad Metro Rail Project Phase II from Sector-1 Station in the state capital. Notably, PM Modi is be on a two-day visit to his home state from September 15 and among several programmes, he inaugurated the Ahmedabad metro extension Phase 2. Part one of Phase 2, the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar metro rail spans up to 21 kilometres, covering a total of eight new metro stations initially and providing seamless and efficient transportation services to both residential and commercial areas. Part two of Phase 1, which is still under construction, will connect Sector 1 in Gandhinagar to Mahatma Mandir, a locality in the state capital which houses a mega convention and exhibition centre. The project, developed by the Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) in collaboration with the state government and the Centre, will further expand the metro network, linking key locations between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar like GNLU (Gujarat National Law University), PDEU (Pandit Deendayal Energy University), Gift City, Raysan, Randesan, Dholakuva, Infocity and Sector-1. This new phase, stretching from Motera to Gandhinagar's Sector-1, will connect crucial hubs such as GIFT City, facilitating easy access for professionals, students, and tourists. The total project cost for Phase 2 metro stands at Rs 5,384 crore with funding secured through loans from international financial institutions like AFD (France) and KfW (Germany). The extended metro route dramatically reduces the travel time between Ahmedabad, Gujarat's commercial hub, and state capital Gandhinagar, located nearly 25km apart. For instance, commuters can now travel between APMC and GIFT City in under an hour, at a cost of around Rs 35.",

            "content": "The Adani Group vehemently rejected fraudulent press releases being circulated related to the conglomerate's presence in Kenya. In a statement released on Monday, the business group claimed that certain \"vested interests with malicious intent\" are circulating multiple fraudulent press releases, including one titled \"Adani Group Denounces Baseless Accusations and Threats\". Notably, the clarification came a week after the workers in Kenya held massive protests against their government's plan to provide airport expansion projects to the Adani group. They alleged the government would lease the airport to Adani Group for 30 years, in exchange for $1.85 billion of investment by Adani into the airport's expansion. However, workers at Kenya's main international airport ended a day-long strike on Wednesday (September 11), after they were assured by the government that a plan to lease the airport to an Indian company would only proceed with the union's approval. This triggered multiple speculative reports published against the business tycoon and his firms. Meanwhile, in a stern statement, the Adani group said it will take legal action against anyone involved in spreading false narratives. \"We categorically state that neither the Adani Group nor any of its companies or subsidiaries have issued any Press Releases related to Kenya,\" the Group spokesperson emphasised. \"We strongly condemn this deceitful act and urge everyone to disregard these fake fraudulent releases completely. We will take legal action against anyone involved in spreading false narratives,\" said the Group. The spokesperson encouraged the \"media and influencers to verify facts and sources before publishing or broadcasting any articles or news on the Adani Group\". Last week, the Adani Group unequivocally rejected and denied baseless allegations regarding claims by US short-seller Hindenburg Research that Swiss authorities have frozen its funds. Dismissing the allegations, an Adani Group spokesperson denied the baseless claims. \"We unequivocally reject and deny the baseless allegations presented. The Adani Group has no involvement in any Swiss court proceedings, nor have any of our company accounts been subject to sequestration by any authority,\u201d the company spokesperson had said. The Adani Group remains \"steadfastly committed to transparency and compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements,\" the spokesperson noted. (With inputs from agency)",

Attempts are on to revive terrorism as the National Conference and Congress manifesto talks about releasing terrorists. This is the Modi government and nobody has the power to revive terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d Mr. Shah said addressing an election rally in Padder-Nagseni Assembly segment in support of BJP\u2019s candidate and former minister Sunil Sharma in Gulabgarh. \u201cThis election is between two powers, on one side National Conference and PDP and on the other BJP. The NC-Congress are saying that if we form the government we will restore Article 370. Tell me should it be restored? Your reservation, given by BJP to Paharis and Gujjars and others, will be snatched.

This was the Home Minister\u2019s second visit to Jammu region within a fortnight. Earlier, during his two-day visit to Jammu on September 6 and 7, he released BJP\u2019s manifesto for J&K Assembly elections and addressed a workers convention. Monday is the last day for campaigning in 24 Assembly constituencies, including Padder-Nagseni, which goes to polls in the first phase on September 18.

I responded to the media by saying, 'Yeh Modi hai, yaha kisi ka dabaav nahi chalta hai',\" PM Modi said while addressing the fourth Global Renewable Energy Investor's Meet in Gujarat's Gandhinagar.

The Opposition has been alleging that the BJP 3.0 is running on \"crutches\" of the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal United (JDU) and the Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) who have played the role of kingmakers in the NDA government after the BJP fell short of the majority mark on June 4. The Opposition's claims come as the Centre sent the Waqf Board Bill in the Parliament to the Joint Parliamentary Committee for wider discussion and consideration. Since June 9, when Prime Minister Modi was sworn in for the post for the third consecutive term, the government also rolled back the lateral entry scheme of the UPSC. Prime Minister Modi said green future and net zero are India's commitments and the country is \"worried about the future of humanity\". \"When the issue of climate change did not even emerge in the world, Mahatma Gandhi alerted the world... His life was of minimum carbon footprint... He had said that the earth has enough resources to fulfil our needs but not our greed... For us, green future and net zero are not just some fancy words but they are India's commitment... As a developing economy, we had a valid excuse to discard these commitments. We could have said that we cannot play a role in this sector. But we did not do that. We were the people who worried about the future of humanity... Today's India is creating a base for the next 1000 years,\" he said. \"Our goal is not just to reach the top but also to sustain at the top. India knows its energy needs and requirements to become a developed nation by 2047. We also know that we do not have our own oil and gas reserves... So we decided to build our future on solar, wind, nuclear and hydro powers...,\" PM Modi added.",

            "content": "The health minister informed the media that a total of 151 people are currently on the primary contact list. Their information has been gathered, and those who had direct contact have been placed in isolation. The death of a 24-year-old student in Malappuram, Kerala, has raised alarm over the deadly Nipah virus. Kerala Health Minister Veena George announced on Sunday that tests conducted at the National Institute of Virology in Pune confirmed the presence of the Nipah virus in the deceased. The health minister informed the media that a total of 151 people are currently on the primary contact list. Their information has been gathered, and those who had direct contact have been placed in isolation. Five individuals in isolation exhibited mild symptoms, and their samples have been sent for testing. Nipah was first detected in Malaysia in 1999, though no further outbreaks have been reported there since. Two years later, the virus was identified in Bangladesh and India. India's first case of Nipah virus occurred in Siliguri, West Bengal, in 2001. In Kerala, where two cases have been reported this year, previous outbreaks occurred in Kozhikode district in 2018, 2021, and 2023, and in Ernakulam district in 2019. How does it spread? The Nipah outbreak in Kerala is cause for significant concern due to the severity of the disease, which has a fatality rate of up to 75%. Fruit bats are the natural carriers of the virus, and it can be transmitted to humans through contamination from animals like pigs and bats. Additionally, the virus can spread from human to human. Nipah virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, such as bats or pigs, or their body fluids (like blood, urine, or saliva). It can also spread by consuming food products contaminated by body fluids from infected animals, such as palm sap or fruit tainted by an infected bat. Additionally, close contact with an infected person or their bodily fluids, including nasal or respiratory droplets, urine, or blood, can lead to transmission. Symptoms and complications associated with Nipah virus infection Nipah infection presents with common symptoms such as headache, fever, vomiting, sore throat, dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and acute encephalitis. Symptoms typically appear 4 to 14 days after exposure. The virus has a significant impact on neurological health, with approximately 20% of infected individuals experiencing lasting neurological effects, including seizure disorders and personality changes. According to information from the Kerala health department, Nipah virus infection symptoms can vary from mild to severe, with a fatality rate of 40% to 70% in documented outbreaks between 1998 and 2018. Nipah virus infection is diagnosed in its early stages using RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) and later in the infection through ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Early diagnosis can be difficult as the initial signs and symptoms are often non-specific. To prevent the spread of Nipah virus, several precautionary steps must be taken. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises avoiding close, unprotected physical contact with individuals infected by the virus. It also recommends frequent handwashing, especially after caring for or visiting sick people.",

            "content": "Donald Trump blasted Taylor Swift on social media for endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, declaring his hatred for the pop star. Washington: Former US President Donald Trump slammed singer Taylor Swift, days after she endorsed his presidential rival and Vice President, Kamala Harris. In a strongly worded post, Trump said he \"hates\" the pop star. \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" he said on Truth Social on Sunday. Last week, Taylor Swift came in support of Vice President Kamala Harris, the day she sparred off Trump in a presidential debate organised by ABC News. \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" Swift said. On Wednesday, she took to Instagram and penned a lengthy note. The note stated, \"Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven't already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.\" Harris was nominated as the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden quit the presidential race amid mounting concerns over his age, particularly after his poor show in the debate with Donald Trump in June. She is the first female, first Black, and first Asian American vice president. If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president. The vice president is only the second woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party. Heaping praises on Harris, Swift called her a \"warrior\" and a \"steady-handed, gifted leader\". She also said the country can accomplish much more if led by 'calm' than being led by \"chaos,\" in a veiled reference to former President Trump. \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades,\" the singer added. A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) She concluded her post by calling herself a \"childless cat lady,\" alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen JD Vance, Trump's running mate, to criticize Democrats. Kamala Harris is of Indian origin. Her mother was Indian and her father is Jamaican; both immigrated to the United States. She was born in Oakland, California, and attended a historically black university, Howard University, in Washington.",

Mumbai: Masaba Gupta recently made her appearance on Fate D'Souza's podcast where she spoke about the cruelty she has faced due to several things. Recalling how she was trolled massively for starting her makeup brand Love Child. Masaba reveals her skin was compared to late veteran actor Om Puri and more. She even recalled how she was teased by boys when she was a professional tennis player,\u201d There was a lot of catcalling from the boys about my body. I was a professional tennis player, so I had these broad shoulders and ripped arms and legs. I also developed very early, so I was not dainty, or feminine, so it was like where is this thing from? I was very happy in my own bubble in school, I did my own thing. I didn\u2019t make great friends in school which I regret apart 2-3 of them.\u201d Watch the video of Masaba Gupta talking about the trolling she faced for being born out of wedlock and more. A post shared by Faye D\u2019Souza (@fayedsouza) Masaba even revealed she was called a bastard child, as her mother Neena Gupta had her before marriage, \u201cIt was used against me 100 percent, it was public and it was very interesting because the kids would speak about it like adults. I could hear them repeating something they heard in their house. One kid went on to say, \u2018Hey bast**d, I believe you are a bast**d child\u2019. This was when I was in the 7th grade. A lot of people also didn\u2019t understand how I looked physically or why I looked like that\u201d. Masaba is a successful entrepreneur and fashion designer today and she is all set to embrace motherhood.",

About a quarter of Mardis' business comes from real estate agents who are prepping homes for sale or from new home buyers. Customer queries, he recalls, quickly dropped almost as soon as the Fed started jacking up interest rates in March 2022 and then kept raising rates through July 2023.As the housing market contracted, Mardis had to lay off about half his staff of 30.

            "content": "Just recently, the trailer of the film 'Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video' directed by Raj Shandilya was released. Through this film, will once again be seen entertaining the audience as Vicky. In the earlier film Stree 2, his character's name was also Vicky. For the first time, Rajkummar and Triptii Dimri's pair will be seen in the upcoming film 'Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video'. Although this comedy film is being liked a lot through its trailer, after watching many of its scenes, you will remember the Hollywood film Sex Tape. It was being said that this film has been copied from Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel starrer Sex Tape. Now director Raj Shandilya has given his clarification on this. He said that he had not even seen the Hollywood film. In an interview with PTI, Raj said, 'My film is completely different from the Hollywood film Sex Tape. Their characters are also not the same. Someone asked me on Twitter if this film is like 'Sex Tape'. I said that there is no sex in our film. One of our writers told me that their video in that film has gone viral on the internet. The video of our film is made by the couple and they lose the CD due to their negligence.' The director further said, 'I am not inspired by that film, rather in these matters I get inspired by the people and environment around me. At the same time, the sequel of this film is also going to come soon. This film was written in the era when the Internet had just come to India. The story of Part 2 will be about 10 to 15 years later.' Vicky Vidya's Woh Wala video is produced by Bhushan Kumar's T-Series. Apart from Rajkummar and , Vijay Raaz, Mallika Sherawat, Tiku Talsani and Archana Puran Singh will be seen among others. This film will be released in theatres on October 11.",

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, are high on confidence after their win over England in the third Test match at the Oval. Even though they lost the three-match series, a win away from home, especially in England, is always special and Dhanajaya de Silva will be hoping that his team continues to perform well in favourable conditions.

            "content": "In the vast landscape of travel accommodations, a quiet revolution is underway\u2014a subtle shift that is profoundly altering the way we experience the world. While hotels and resorts have long reigned as the quintessential choices for travelers, a rising star has emerged in the realm of hospitality\u2014the homestay. Homestays are steadily gaining popularity, and their ascent is not by chance. They offer travelers something that traditional accommodations often struggle to provide\u2014an intimate, cozy, and immersive experience that transcends the standard tourist encounter. This shift toward homestays is driven by the desire for a more personal and authentic connection to the places we visit, and it's transforming the way we perceive and enjoy travel. So, what exactly fuels the appeal of homestays, and what sets them apart in today's crowded travel landscape? Let's see what Zishan Khan, Chief Acquisition Officer & Co-Founder, Ekostay has to say on this: Authenticity: In an era where authenticity is a revered currency in travel, homestays stand as a paragon of genuine experiences. Modern travelers seek more than just a superficial encounter with a destination; they yearn to delve deep into its heart. Homestays, unlike standard hotel rooms, serve as a portal to this world of authenticity. By situating guests within local communities, they facilitate a seamless transition from tourist to temporary local. Travelers get to engage with the culture, traditions, and rhythms of everyday life in an authentic and meaningful way. Personal Touch: Homestays offer a level of personalization that is unparalleled. Hosts often go above and beyond to ensure guests feel not just accommodated but genuinely welcomed. It's not uncommon to find freshly baked goods awaiting you, a handwritten note from your host expressing their excitement for your visit, or a curated guide to hidden gems and dining spots in the area. This personal touch creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, leaving an indelible impression that lasts well beyond the stay. Privacy and Space: Unlike the often bustling and impersonal atmosphere of hotels, homestays provide a haven of privacy and space. Whether you're seeking a romantic escape or a family retreat, these accommodations offer the ideal setting. Enjoy leisurely mornings in your own space, whip up a culinary masterpiece in a well-equipped kitchen, or simply unwind in a cozy living room. Homestays are versatile and cater to a wide range of travelers and their diverse needs. Value for Money: In addition to the advantages of an authentic experience and personalization, homestays often deliver exceptional value for money. Guests receive more space, privacy, and amenities compared to what traditional accommodations offer at a similar price point. This cost-effective equation benefits both hosts and guests, making homestays a smart and rewarding choice. The allure of homestays resides in their unique ability to offer cozy getaways. They transport travelers from the standard hotel experience to a realm of warmth, personal connections, and authentic encounters.

The future of travel is undeniably undergoing a transformation, and homestays are at the forefront of this paradigm shift. They are redefining the travel experience, turning it into a journey of warmth, authenticity, and personal connections.

            "content": "As \u2018Pink\u2019 marks its 8th anniversary, it continues to resonate deeply with audiences and critics alike. The film, which won the National Award for its poignant portrayal of gender issues and sexual harassment, remains a significant milestone in Indian cinema. Shoojit Sircar, who produced the film under the banner of Rising Sun Films and was also the creative director of the film, his vision was instrumental in shaping the film, particularly the climax, which heightened its emotional and social impact. Known for his thoughtful approach to filmmaking, Sircar has always emphasized the deeper purpose behind \u2018Pink\u2019. In a throwback to when \u2018Pink\u2019 received its National Award, Sircar shared his perspective on the film's purpose and reception. He reflected on the significance of the film in a way that reveals his deeper intentions, stating, in an old interview, Shoojit stated, \"I am delighted that the people and the jury have enjoyed it; I am proud and honoured, but this film is to reflect, not to celebrate. If you see this film and come out, it will leave you with a strong impression. It still bothers me to watch my own film, so no celebrations. We wish to reflect. And we are going to carry this notion forward. We will take Pink wherever feasible so that it can reach the widest audience.\" This quote, emphasises Sircar's intention for the film to be a catalyst for reflection rather than celebration. The film's themes of introspection and societal issues have only grown more relevant as conversations around such topics continue to evolve and gain prominence. Looking ahead, Shoojit Sircar and Rising Sun Films are set to continue their tradition of thought-provoking cinema. Their next untitled project, featuring , is scheduled for a worldwide release on November 15th, 2024. As Sircar remains dedicated to creating impactful stories, \u2018Pink\u2019 stands as a powerful example of his commitment to meaningful and socially conscious filmmaking.",

            "content": "Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar expressed confidence that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will emerge victorious in the upcoming Haryana assembly elections and form the government in Haryana under the leadership of Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini. Speaking to the media, Khattar emphasised that the BJP is on track to form the government again, citing the lack of any strong opposition or coalition efforts by the Congress. Khattar took a sharp dig at the Congress party, predicting their defeat, and highlighted its isolation in the political landscape. \"No party has extended their hand for an alliance with Congress, which shows their weakening position,\" Khattar remarked. He also criticised Congress leaders for making \"absurd\" and \"irresponsible\" statements on sensitive issues such as reservation and the Sikh community. Khattar's statements come as the BJP ramps up its campaign efforts ahead of the state elections, with Saini emerging as the key face of the party's leadership in Haryana. Earlier on Sunday, Union Minister also asserted that Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini is the BJP's CM face and the party will score a hattrick of wins in the state under his leadership. Pradhan and Khattar's statements came after BJP's senior leader Anil Vij said he will stake claim for the CM's post if the party returns to power after the October 5 assembly polls in Haryana. The Election Commission of India (ECI) today (August 31) revised the polling day for Haryana Assembly Elections from October 1 to October 5, this year as well as moved the counting of votes for both Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana Assemblies from October 4 to October 8. The decision has been taken to honour both the voting rights and the traditions of the Bishnoi community, which has upheld a centuries-old practice of participating in the Asoj Amavasya festival celebration in remembrance of their Guru Jambheshwar as per the ECI.",

            "content": "BJP's Sirsa candidate Rohtash Jangra on Monday (September 16) said he has withdrawn nomination for the seat, indicating that the party is likely to extend support to Haryana Lokhit Party chief Gopal Kanda. Kanda is a sitting MLA from Sirsa. He had earlier extended his support to the BJP government. \"I have withdrawn my nomination. The decision has been taken in the interest of the state and the country...we have to ensure a 'Congress Mukt Haryana',\" Jangra told PTI over the phone. Asked if he has withdrawn in Kanda's favour, Jangra said, \"Gopal Kanda has supported us (BJP) for five years. We have taken this decision for Sirsa's development.\" The BJP, like the Congress, will now be contesting 89 of the 90 Assembly seats in the state. The Congress has left the Bhiwani seat for CPI(M). Last week, the BJP released its third and final list of candidates for the Haryana polls, in which the party fielded Jangra from Sirsa. The Indian National Lok Dal said on Thursday that it was extending support to Kanda in Sirsa. The INLD is contesting the assembly polls in alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Gopal Kanda, the leader of the Haryana Lokhit Party, is a 57-year-old MLA from Sirsa. He founded this party himself. Kanda has previously served as the state's Home, Industries, and Urban Local Bodies Minister. He recently gained attention when a Delhi court acquitted him in a high-profile case where he was accused of abetting the suicide of an air hostess. In the last election, Gopal Kanda won the Sirsa Assembly seat by a narrow margin, defeating his closest rival, independent candidate Gokul Setia, by just 602 votes. Polling for the 90 Assembly seats in Haryana will be held on October 5 and votes will be counted on October 8. The ruling BJP is eyeing a hat-trick of wins but faces a stiff challenge from a resurgent Congress, which is looking to cash in on the anti-incumbency factor.",

            "content": "Mamata Banerjee has made a final attempt to negotiate with agitating doctors at RG Kar Hospital, inviting them to a crucial meeting in hopes of resolving the ongoing strike. Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government on Monday invited the agitating doctors for the \u2018fifth and the final time\u2019 to hold talks to put an end to the RG Kar impasse. This move comes two days after the state chief minister faced a deadlock on live streaming of the meeting. In an email, Chief secretary Manoj Pant has asked the protesters to meet Mamata Banerjee at her residence in Kalighat at 5 pm today. \"This is the fifth and the final time we are reaching out to you for a meeting between the honourable CM and the delegates. In line with our discussion the day before (Saturday), we are once again inviting you for the meeting with the CM at her Kalighat residence for discussions with an open mind,\" he wrote, reported PTI. Pant expressed optimism that \"good sense will prevail\" following an agreement on Saturday to prohibit live-streaming or videography of the meeting, as the issue remains sub-judice before the Supreme Court. \"Instead, the minutes of the meeting will be recorded and signed by both the parties,\" he said. In response to the email, the protesting doctors stated they would deliberate among themselves before deciding whether to attend the meeting. Junior doctors at the state-run hospital have been on strike since August 9, protesting the rape and murder of a colleague at the facility.",

Aside from sounding off on social media, golf was on the agenda.Then the Secret Service spotted the muzzle of a rifle sticking out of a fence in bushes at Trump's West Palm Beach golf club, and everything changed.For the second time in just over two months, someone apparently tried to shoot Trump and came dangerously close to the former president in that effort within 500 yards Sunday, law enforcement officials said. This time, the gunfire came from the Secret Service, before the suspect could get any shots off at his target.The episode raised sharp questions about how to keep the former president safe -- not only while he is campaigning across the country, but while he spends time at his own clubs and properties.Trump has had stepped-up security since the assassination attempt on him in July, when he was wounded in the ear during an attack that laid bare a series",

            "description": "The COP29 summit will be the most watched as it is expected to land a new agreement on climate finance",
            "content": "Global warming. Disappearing plant and animal species. Fertile land turning to desert. Plastic in the oceans, on land, and the air we breathe. These urgent environmental challenges will be in the spotlight over the next few months as the United Nations hosts four major sessions to address key threats to the planet. Biodiversity First up is a Conference of the Parties (COP) dedicated to biodiversity being held in Cali, Colombia, from October 21 to November 1. These are called every two years to debate how the world can cooperate to better protect the rich variety of plant and animal life in the natural world. The COP16 isn\u2019t expected to break new ground but is more a stocktake of progress since the last summit secured historic assurances for biodiversity. In 2022 in Montreal, nations agreed to place 30 percent of the planet under environmental protection by 2030 in a landmark pact aimed at arresting biodiversity loss and restoring ecosystems to health. In Cali, countries will put forward national strategies to meet this global objective, and observers hope Colombia as host will provide a model for others to follow. WWF has commended the leadership shown so far by Colombia, which hosts close to 10 percent of Earth\u2019s biodiversity, including countless bird, butterfly, and orchid species. Climate The world\u2019s most important conference on climate change is this year being hosted by Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic heavily dependent on oil and gas exports, from November 11 to 22. While the last summit in Dubai in 2023 delivered a historic commitment to transition the world away from fossil fuels, supporting poorer countries with climate change will top this year\u2019s agenda. The summit, known as COP29, is expected to land a new agreement on climate finance: money from rich nations most responsible for global warming to developing countries vulnerable to climate change. There isn\u2019t an agreed figure yet, or even consensus on where the money should come from, who should receive it, and what form it could take. But developing countries are pushing for much more than the $100 billion pledged in 2009. This was only reached for the first time in full in 2022. \u201cCOP29 offers an opportunity to unlock more climate investments from a wider range of public and private sources and to improve the quality of this finance,\u201d said the World Resources Institute, a US think tank. The result of the US election, just six days before COP29 begins, could throw a last-minute curveball into the final negotiations, which have proved divisive so far. It also remains to be seen how many world leaders travel to Baku, the capital on the Caspian Sea, with some expected to focus their energy on COP30 in Brazil next year. Desertification The least high profile of the three COPs, this session in Saudi Arabia addressing the loss of fertile land to desert is nonetheless critical. Climate variation like droughts and human activities like overgrazing can result in desertification, a process mainly in dry areas where land degrades and becomes unproductive. Experts hope the COP16 on desertification, scheduled to take place in Riyadh from December 2 to 13, can act as a turning point in addressing this problem. \u201cDiscussions will focus on ways to restore 1.5 billion hectares of land by 2030, as well as putting in place agreements to manage the droughts that are already affecting many regions of the globe,\u201d said Arona Diedhiou from the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development. Plastic In 2022, some 175 nations agreed to fast-track negotiations toward a world-first treaty on plastic pollution, and the final session gets underway on November 25 in South Korea. The treaty aims to marshal an international response to the plastic trash choking the environment, from oceans and rivers to mountains and sea ice. Some nations want the treaty to restrict how much plastic can be made while others -- particularly oil and gas producing countries that provide the raw materials to make plastic -- want a focus on recycling. Hellen Kahaso Dena, head of Greenpeace\u2019s Pan-African Plastics Project, hopes that countries \u201cwill agree on a treaty that prioritises reducing plastic production\u201d. \u201cThere is no time to waste with approaches that will not solve the problem,\u201d the activist said.

            "content": "The re-release of 'Tumbbad' has quickly matched its original week-long earnings of \u20b97.34 crore in just three days. New Delhi: The re-release of the critically acclaimed film 'Tumbbad' has achieved a significant box office milestone, mirroring its original week-long earnings in just three days. Originally launched in 2018, 'Tumbbad' earned \u20b97.34 crore over its first week. During its recent re-release, the film has matched this impressive figure in a mere three days, underscoring its continued resonance with audiences. The film\u2019s re-release has witnessed a remarkable box office performance, beginning with \u20b91.65 crore on its first day, followed by an impressive \u20b92.65 crore on the second day. By the end of Day 3, Tumbbad\u2019s cumulative earnings have reached \u20b97.34 crore, effectively replicating its initial week\u2019s revenue within a fraction of the time. This rapid success highlights the film's sustained allure and the growing enthusiasm among viewers for its unique cinematic experience. A post shared by Sohum Shah Films (@sohumshahfilms) Directed by Rahi Anil Barve and guided by Anand Gandhi, 'Tumbbad' has long been celebrated for its distinctive horror-fantasy narrative and breathtaking visual storytelling. The film's immersive atmosphere and innovative approach have garnered critical acclaim and a devoted fan base. Its re-release, brought to the big screen by Eros International and Aanand L Rai, has rekindled interest and excitement, reaffirming the film's status as a modern classic. The strategic decision to limit the film's availability to theatrical screenings, with no presence on OTT platforms, has fueled the buzz and generated significant audience engagement. This approach has proved successful, as evidenced by the film\u2019s robust box office performance over the weekend, particularly on Day 3. The resurgence of 'Tumbbad' in theaters has set new benchmarks for re-releases in the Indian film industry. The film\u2019s remarkable performance demonstrates the enduring power of experiencing cinematic masterpieces on the big screen, where their full artistic and emotional impact can be fully appreciated. This renewed success highlights the value of classic films and their ability to captivate audiences across time.",

            "content": "The AAP's Political Affairs Committee is all set to meet in the evening on Monday to finalise name for interim Delhi chief minister. The AAP has scheduled a series of meetings, including that of its political affairs committee, to decide on a new chief minister for Delhi, a day after Arvind Kejriwal's surprise announcement of quitting the post. Senior AAP leader and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia reached Kejriwal's official residence to discuss with him the names of probables for the chief minister's post, AAP leaders said. The AAP's Political Affairs Committee meeting is scheduled to be held at the Delhi chief minister's residence later in the evening. Delhi ministers Atishi, Gopal Rai, Saurabh Bharadwaj, Kailash Gahlot, some MLAs from the reserved category, including Deputy Speaker of Delhi Assembly Rakhi Birla, as well as the AAP supremo's wife Sunita Kejriwal, were making the rounds as probables for the post. Addressing AAP workers at party headquarters on Sunday, Kejriwal announced to step down as chief minister amid corruption allegations against him and vowed not to return to the post till he got a \"certificate of honesty\" from the people. The AAP national convener said that he would become chief minister and Manish Sisodia his deputy \"only when people say we are honest\". A party functionary on Monday said, \"Kejriwal and Sisodia will be meeting today. This will be the first meeting after the decision by them.The meeting is also likely to see a discussion over the next chief minister.\" Kejriwal, who was released on bail from the Tihar Jail in the excise policy graft case on Friday, has said that he would hold a meeting of the AAP MLAs in a couple of days and one of his party colleagues would take over as the chief minister.",

An audio recording of a conversation between the complainant contractor Cheluvaraju and MLA Munirathna, is the key evidence in the case. In the audio clip, the man purported to be MLA Munirathna is heard hurling casteist abuses against a Scheduled Caste community and danding a bribe, threatening the contractor. The audio clip has already been sent for FSL, Madiwala. The voice in the audio clip will be matched with voice samples collected from MLA Munirathna. Denying allegations against him, Mr. Munirathna has said that the voice in the audio clip is not his, and he would resign as an MLA if the voice was proved to be his.

Oshada Fernando has returned to the Test side for the first time since March 2023, having played against the same opposition, New Zealand, 18 months ago. Fernando has replaced Nishan Madushka in the 16-man squad for the Test series in Galle. Fernando returned with scores of 122 and 80 for Sri Lanka A against South Africa A and hence has been recalled to the side. Kasun Rajitha and Nisala Tharaka have been axed from the squad that played the England series while 13 players have been retained. Sri Lanka have added a couple of more spinners for the assignment, understandably, given the change in the conditions from the UK and since they are coming off winning at the Oval and avoiding a sweep, the islanders will be slightly confident of a better show in familiar conditions against a side, which hasn't travelled well. New Zealand are on a long tour of Asia having been to India for the one-off Test against Afghanistan. The Kiwis will be playing a couple of Tests against Sri Lanka and then will return to India for a three-match series in October-November. Sri Lanka are in fifth position on the World Test Championship (WTC) points table with a PCT of 42.86 while New Zealand are in third with a 50.00 PCT. New Zealand have a long Test season ahead as they play Sri Lanka and India away, followed by England at home. These five Tests will all but decide their fate in the ongoing WTC cycle.

            "content": "In a significant development into the rape and murder case of a trainee doctor in Kolkata, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has raised serious concerns about the role of RG Kar Hospital's former principal Sandip Ghosh in an ongoing investigation, suspecting that he tried to deceive the polygraph test. According to the CBI\u2019s remand note, there were several key questions in the case where Ghosh\u2019s responses were found to be \"deceptive\" based on the polygraph results prepared by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL). Taking this into consideration, the investigative agency now intends to conduct a narco test on Ghosh to gather more truthful information. Sandeep Ghosh, the former Principal of RG Kar Medical College, is under scrutiny in a case involving the suspicious death of a second-year female Postgraduate trainee doctor. The CBI has already conducted polygraph tests on ten individuals, including Ghosh, but inconsistencies in Ghosh's responses have made the agency suspicious of his role in the case. The remand note claimed that Ghosh, despite receiving information about the incident, did not immediately rush to the hospital or take formal action. Instead, an ambiguous complaint was later lodged through the Vice Principal (Medical Superintendent), Dr Sumit Roy Tapadar. The complaint, submitted to the Officer-in-Charge of Tala Police Station, Abhijit Mondal, vaguely mentioned that the body of the female student was found in the Chest Seminar Room at 9:45 a.m (August 10) but it made no reference to the possibility of murder or sexual assault, even though external injuries on the body indicated foul play, as per the remand note. The CBI has pointed out that Ghosh\u2019s delayed and unclear actions have further complicated the investigation. It also noted that instead of filing a First Information Report (FIR) promptly, Ghosh and the hospital authorities allegedly promoted a suicide theory, despite clear evidence to the contrary. The victim\u2019s body bore visible external injuries, which indicated that it was not a case of suicide, yet the hospital\u2019s complaint failed to mention the possibility of homicide or rape. It is pertinent here that a postgraduate trainee doctor was allegedly raped and murdered while on duty at the hospital on August 9. Later, the semi-naked body of the 32-year-old woman was found in the seminar hall of the government-run hospital in Kolkata. A civic volunteer was arrested in connection with the crime the next day. Following this, the Calcutta High Court ordered the transfer of the probe into the case from the Kolkata Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation.",

Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule said he does not support the MLA\u2019s remarks. BJP is a constituent of the Shiv Sena-led government in the State. \u201cWhile he was abroad, Rahul Gandhi said that he wants to finish off the reservation system in India. This has exposed the true face of the Congress,\u201d Mr. Gaikwad told reporters, before announcing the bizarre reward. Mr. Gaikwad, an MLA from Buldhana Assembly seat in Vidarbha region, is no stranger to controversies. Last month, a video of a policeman washing the Shiv Sena MLA\u2019s car had gone viral on social media. Mr. Gaikwad had later explained that the policeman cleaned the vehicle voluntarily after vomiting inside it. In February, Mr. Gaikwad had claimed that he had hunted a tiger in 1987 and has been wearing its tooth around his neck. Soon after, the State Forest Department sent the purported tiger tooth for forensic identification and charged Mr. Gaikwad under the Wildlife Protection Act.

Wearing masks has been made compulsory while going out in the district. Students and teachers across the district have been asked to wear masks while in school. Wards 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Thiruvali grama panchayat and ward 7 of Mampad grama panchayat have been declared containment zones. People in those wards have been advised not to gather and to avoid all social functions. Shops and business establishments will be allowed to work from 10 am to 7 pm in these zones. Schools, colleges, madrassas, anganwadis and cinema halls will remain closed until further orders in these zones. Fifteen persons who took part in the funeral of the 24-year-old Nipah victim have been placed under observation. As many as 151 people who came in direct contact with the victim, who was a student in Bengaluru, have been quarantined. The deceased youth had earlier reportedly sought treatment at four private hospitals, and had travelled to different places along with his friends. Serum samples of five persons who developed symptoms were sent for testing. The results are awaited by Monday evening, said the officials. Nipah death in July On July 21, 2024, a 14-year-old schoolboy from Pandikkad, about 10 km away from Wandoor, Malappuram, had succumbed to Nipah virus at Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. The boy\u2019s death had triggered an alarm across Malappuram district, and the district authorities had imposed restrictions in two panchayats then. A previous Nipah outbreak in Malappuram and Kozhikode districts had claimed 17 lives in 2018.

After a meeting with party workers in Jhanjharpur, Tejashwi Yadav spoke to the media at the guest house and fiercely criticised the Chief Minister. \u201cIn one of our meetings, CID and Special Branch officers were sitting there, taking notes. We initially thought they were journalists. After the internal party meeting, journalists usually leave after taking photos, but these people did not move. Later, we discovered that they were CID and Special Branch officers. They even showed their IDs.\u201d Tejashwi further stated, \"It\u2019s now clear that the Chief Minister is fully engaged in espionage. He is scared and terrified.\" Tejashwi alleged that Nitish has lost his credibility and can \"no longer manage Bihar\". \"The land survey, smart meters, paper leaks, and collapsing bridges are all signs of ongoing corruption in the state.

            "content": "'s form and captaincy have been the talking point in Pakistan cricket at the moment. His last century across any format came on August 30 last year when he scored 151 runs against Nepal. Babar's last century against a top team came in April 2023 in T20Is (vs New Zealand) and his last Test ton came back in December 2022, also against New Zealand. Captaincy has somehow affected his batting and former Pakistan skipper Younis Khan seems to have indirectly hinted that Babar should step down as captain to improve his performance with the bat. He also advised arguably Pakistan's best batter to prioritise fitness and work ethic. Younis gave Kohli's example who stepped down from captaincy to focus on his batting and in the process, regained his form as well. \"If Babar and other top players deliver on the field, then results will be clear to everyone. Humare players khelte kam, bolte jyada hai. (I have observed that our players tend to talk more than they perform). Look at . He chose to step down from captaincy on his own terms, and now he's breaking records worldwide. This shows that playing for the country should be the priority. If there's any energy left, then play for yourself,\" Younis said in an event. This is a clear indication from the Pakistan great to Babar Azam that he should resign from captaincy and focus on his batting just like Kohli did. Is this the only way forward for him now? Babar's numbers as captain are really good as he averages more than 60 in ODIs while leading the team and in T20Is, he averages 37.74 in 78 innings. But the same average has dropped to 46 in ODIs since January 2023 and even though his numbers in T20Is remain unperturbed during this period, Babar's runs haven't been converted to conducive results with his strike rate coming under the scanner. Kohli's record as captain was unmatched across formats but as he lost his form post-2019, he took a wise decision to leave captaincy across formats within three months from November 2021 to January 2022. He has now returned to form as well smashing 10 centuries and 19 fifties in 88 innings and amassing 3468 runs since February 2022 at an average of 45.63.",

As per a report by DW News, the area, where the bomb detonated, is known for its nightlife, and is full of bars and restaurants.

            "content": "Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule has distanced himself from Gaikwad\u2019s remarks, even though the BJP is part of the Shiv Sena-led government in the state. A Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad on Monday announced that he will offer Rs 11 lakh to anyone who cuts off Leader of Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tongue over his comments about ending the reservation system. Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule has distanced himself from Gaikwad\u2019s remarks, even though the BJP is part of the Shiv Sena-led government in the state. \"While he was abroad, Rahul Gandhi said that he wants to finish off the reservation system in India. This has exposed the true face of the Congres,\" Gaikwad told reporters before making his unusual offer. Gaikwad, who represents the Buldhana assembly seat in the Vidarbha region, is no stranger to controversy. Last month, a video went viral showing a policeman cleaning Gaikwad\u2019s car, which led to a flurry of social media buzz. Gaikwad later explained that the policeman had cleaned the car voluntarily after accidentally vomiting inside it. Earlier this year, Gaikwad made headlines by claiming he had hunted a tiger in 1987 and wore its tooth as a necklace. The state Forest Department then had the tooth tested for forensic identification and charged him under the Wildlife Protection Act.",

            "content": "Bajwa said that it is deeply concerning that a minister, who draws a salary funded by taxpayers, fails to comprehend the constitutional values he is sworn to uphold. Chandigarh: Leader of Opposition in Punjab, Partap Singh Bajwa, on Sunday condemned remarks made by Union Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ravneet Singh Bittu on Congress MP Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on Sikhs in the USA. Bajwa said that it is deeply concerning that a minister, who draws a salary funded by taxpayers, fails to comprehend the constitutional values he is sworn to uphold. \"His derogatory remarks demonstrate not only a profound lack of education and understanding of parliamentary principles but also an appalling disregard for responsible public conduct,\" he said. \"It appears that Bittu has completely lost his sense of reason, and perhaps it would be prudent for him to seek professional psychiatric assistance. His inability to win public trust has long been evident, yet he continues to draw a ministerial salary. Perhaps those funds could be better utilised in addressing what seems to be a deeper mental affliction. Such a baseless accusation is not merely a lapse in judgement; it is a clear manifestation of a troubling disconnect between his speech and reasoning,\" Bajwa added. The Congress leader, further urged the Government of India to take note and to ensure that those in positions of power, respect the dignity of the Constitution and the office they hold. \"Ravneet Singh Bittu's irresponsible comments are an affront to democracy and cannot be excused as mere lapses in judgement,\" Partap Singh Bajwa added. Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit slammed the Union Minister over his controversial remarks and said that his political career in the Congress was also a mess. \"We can only pity such people. His political career in Congress was also a mess. He used to praise Rahul Gandhi, and now, after resigning from Congress and joining the BJP, he is showing his loyalty to the BJP party,\" Dixit said. Congress leader Tariq Anwar said, \"Ravneet Bittu has just joined the BJP from the Congress party and he wants to prove that he follows the ideology of BJP and is anti-Rahul Gandhi. That's why he is making these kinds of absurd statements.\" Launching a blistering attack on Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi, Union Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu said on Sunday that the former is not an Indian and is the country's number one terrorist whom the agencies should catch. \"Rahul Gandhi is not an Indian, he has spent most of his time outside. He does not love his country much because he goes abroad and says everything in the wrong way. The people who are most wanted, separatists, and experts in making bombs, guns, and shells, have appreciated what Rahul Gandhi has said. The enemies of the country who try to blow up planes, trains, and roads, are in support of Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi is the country's number 1 terrorist. The biggest enemy of the country whom the agencies should catch is Rahul Gandhi today,\" he said. In another remark, Bittu said that Rahul Gandhi is trying to break a religion abroad, saying that wearing a kada, the turban is not allowed in India. \"The Gandhi family under a conspiracy raped our mothers and sisters in the streets. Bullets were fired at the Golden Temple. Thousands of innocent people were killed. Why are they teasing Sikhs? What do they want to do? He is speaking the language of terrorists like Pannun who are sitting abroad. I will speak the same when he is sitting in front of me in the parliament,\" he said.",

            "content": "Communal violence broke out in Karnataka's Mangaluru on Monday after incidents of stone-pelting on two places of worship were reported. Notably, stones were pelted in Katipalla town in Mangaluru on late Sunday night, but due to quick action, the situation came under control and no untoward incidents were reported in the area. Window panes of the place of worship were shattered, police said. According to police, the alleged stone pelters came on two bikes and sped off and following the incident, heavy police deployment has been put in place. Moreover, the Dakshina Kannada district police said they have beefed up vigils right from Uppinangady on the eastern side of Buntwal and Panemangaluru on the western side. As per the police, a case has been registered against VHP and Bajrang Dal leaders Sharan Pumpwell and Puneeth Attavar for making provocative statements. The Mangaluru police, who have been constantly monitoring the social media platforms, are taking action against those who make provocative statements. Mangaluru Police Commissioner Anupam Agarwal has already given a warning about this. On protest by VHP and Bajrang Dal in Mangaluru over a social media post, Karnataka minister and Congress leader MC Sudhakar said, \"...Mangaluru has always been a hot spot. Politics is done in Mangaluru only on the basis of communal issues. So, it is not surprising. Because on every small issue, you see what someone associated with RSS or someone else has tweeted. We cannot control everyone. There will be some miscreants in every religion. Such miscreants are creating all these issues.\" Following the incident, the Rapid Action Force has been deployed in Mangaluru to maintain order following a protest by workers from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal over a social media post on Monday. Yatish N, the Superintendent of Police (SP) for Dakshina Kannada, stated, \"Today, on the eve of Eid-e-Milad festival, we have made adequate arrangements around the district... We are ensuring that no untoward incident takes place. Whoever disturbs the peace will attract legal action.\" Eid-e-Milad marks the birth of Prophet Muhammad and is being celebrated today with processions held nationwide.",

            "description": "Elon Musk questioned why no similar threats were being made against Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.",
            "content": "Former U.S. president Donald Trump on Sunday (September 15, 2024) thanked the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement officials following an assassination attempt while he was golfing on one of his golf courses in Florida's West Palm Beach. The former president remained unharmed in what the FBI said was \"an attempted assassination\u201d while playing golf two months after another attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally. \u201cTHE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING,\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \u201cI would like to thank everyone for your concern and well wishes \u2014 It was certainly an interesting day! Most importantly, I want to thank the US Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated patriots, and, all of the law enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican nominee in the upcoming presidential election, SAFE,\u201d the presidential candidate said. Local authorities said the U.S. Secret Service agents protecting Mr. Trump fired at a man pointing an AK-style rifle with a scope while the former president was golfing with donor Steve Witkoff when shots were fired, CNN quoted a source familiar with the development as saying. President Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris were briefed and updated on the investigation. Ms. Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate and Mr. Trump's rival in the upcoming election, in a statement, said \u201cviolence has no place in America\u201d. Mr. Biden echoed that thought in his statement, adding that he had directed his team to ensure the Secret Service \"has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former president's continued safety\u201d. Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X (formerly Twitter), in his comments about attempts on Mr. Trump's life, questioned why no similar threats were being made against Mr. Biden or Ms. Harris. Mr. Musk's controversial remark came in response to a query from an X user who asked why Mr. Trump was being targeted. The Tesla CEO replied: \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing shock after the apparent assassination attempt, said: \u201cSara and I were shocked by the second assassination attempt against [former] president Trump and were relieved to hear that it too failed. But we should not rely on luck.\" \u201cWe send our best wishes to Donald and Melania along with our hopes that all measures will be taken to ensure that such deadly attacks on a candidate for the US presidency will be foiled in advance,\u201d the Israeli prime minister added. It was the latest jarring moment in the former president's life following the July 13 failed assassination attempt on Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a bullet grazed his ear. The incident spawned new questions about Secret Service protective operations after the agency's admitted failures in preventing the attempted assassination this summer. It was not immediately clear whether the development would affect Mr. Trump's campaign as he was set to speak from Florida about cryptocurrency on Monday night on the social media site. Mr. Trump has had a stepped-up security footprint since the July assassination attempt. Former presidents and their spouses have Secret Service protection for life, but the security around former presidents varies according to threat levels and exposure, with the toughest measures typically being taken in the immediate aftermath of their leaving office. Mr. Trump's protective detail has been higher than some other former presidents because of his high visibility and his campaign to seek the White House again.

New Zealand have played 558 white-ball matches while Australia have played 556, India are on fourth position with 502 matches in coloured clothing. England have 236 wins in 398 ODIs while getting over the line in 146 T20Is out of 202 matches. England have won the inaugural T20 World Cup and three ODI World Cup titles to their name. England selected a second-string side for the Ireland tour and ended up losing a match each in the ODI and T20I series. The likes of Mady Villiers and Tammy Beaumont were the stars but taking Ireland lightly did trouble England on a couple of occasions and Sunday was probably the best example of the same. England were on their way to a score in excess of 175-180. However, just 35 runs in the last four while losing four wickets shifted the momentum a bit in Ireland's favour. Ireland lost their opener Aimee Hunter quite cheaply before captain Gaby Lewis and Predergast joined forces to keep England bowlers at bay. Predergast smashed a 51-ball 80 as even though Ireland underwent a bit of a middle-order collapse, but the all-rounder had ensured that her side couldn't lose from that position. There was a harakiri at the end but Ireland got home safely and did what no other Irish team could do before in the shortest format. A few players from this squad will now join the main team in the UAE for the Women's T20 World Cup, starting on October 3.",

            "content": "The Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) on Monday (September 16, 2024) vowed to cancel the Adani Group\u2019s wind power project in Sri Lanka if it gets elected in the presidential election scheduled for the weekend. JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the presidential candidate from the broader front National People\u2019s Power (NPP), told a political chat show here that they would annul the project. Asked if the project posed a threat to the island nation\u2019s energy sector sovereignty, Mr. Dissanayake said, \u201cYes. We will definitely cancel it as it threatens our energy sovereignty.\u201d The JVP, which led a bloody anti-India rebellion in the island nation between 1987 and 1990 following India\u2019s direct intervention in the Lankan civil war through the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord, is believed to be leading in the unofficial polls ahead of the September 21 election . The JVP dubbed the Indo-Lanka Accord a betrayal of the nation and killed the then-ruling party members, supporters and other political activists who supported the pact signed between then-prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and J.R. Jayewardena, the President of Sri Lanka at that time. A crucial election in Sri Lanka | Explained The Adani Group has faced fundamental rights litigation in Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court after it got approval for the proposed construction of a wind power project in the island nation\u2019s northeastern regions of Mannar and Pooneryn. The Adani Group was set to invest over $440 million in the 20-year agreement for the development of 484 megawatts of wind power in the region. Editorial | Back from the brink: On the Sri Lankan elections and the road ahead Petitioners have raised environmental concerns and lack of transparency in the bidding process to grant Adani Green Energy the go-ahead. Petitioners have also argued that the agreed tariff of $0.0826 per kWh would be a loss to Sri Lanka and should be lowered to $0.005 per kWh.

He was a suryavanshi. A grand temple of Lord Ram has been built (in Ayodhya), but I want to tell the world that Ayodhya is moving with the target of a model solar city. The work is near completion,\u201d PM Modi said at RE-INVEST 2024. \u201cOur effort is that every household in Ayodhya runs on solar energy. We have so far connected several places with solar energy. We have identified 17 cities in the country that we can develop as solar cities,\u201d he added. The Prime Minister green future and net zero are India\u2019s commitment and the country \u201cworried about the future of humanity\u201d. \u201c... When the issue of climate change did not even emerge in the world, Mahatma Gandhi alerted the world... His life was of minimum carbon footprint... He had said that the earth has enough resources to fulfil our needs but not our greed... For us, green future and net zero are not just some fancy words but they are India's commitment... As a developing economy, we had a valid excuse to discard these commitments. We could have said that we cannot play a role in this sector. But we did not do that. We were the people who worried about the future of humanity... Today's India is creating a base for the next 1000 years,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is not just to reach the top but also to sustain at the top. India knows its energy needs and requirements to become a developed nation by 2047. We also know that we do not have our own oil and gas reserves... So we decided to build our future on solar, wind, nuclear and hydro powers...\" PM Modi added.",

            "content": "Pregnant women should take additional steps to reduce the risk of infection, such as avoiding contact with infected individuals, practising strict hygiene measures, and staying updated on the latest health advisories. With the World Health Organization declaring monkeypox or MPox Public Health Emergency of International Concern, Union Health Secretary Apurva Chandra on Monday issued an advisory to states and union territories regarding the precautionary actions. Doctors said that precautions need to be taken and among others, pregnant women need to exercise an added dose of caution. Dr Rekha Sukala, Consultant Obstetrician & Gynecologist, Motherhood Hospitals, Sarjapur, Bangalore, says, \"Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has become a growing public health concern in India, particularly for pregnant women, who face distinct challenges in protecting their health and that of their unborn child.\" MPox: Challenges For Pregnant Women MPox is mostly prevalent in the African continent, says Dr Rekha Sukala. \"The virus, which can lead to symptoms like fever, rash, and, in some cases, severe complications, requires increased caution during pregnancy. Pregnant women should take additional steps to reduce the risk of infection, such as avoiding contact with infected individuals, practising strict hygiene measures, and staying updated on the latest health advisories. Prompt medical consultation if symptoms appear and adherence to public health guidelines are critical in safeguarding both maternal and fetal well-being against this emerging threat,\" adds Dr Sukala. Monkeypox: Symptoms of Mpox The symptoms of Mpox, says Dr Sukala, include: \u2022 Fever \u2022 Headache \u2022 Muscle aches \u2022 Swollen lymph nodes \u2022 Exhaustion \u2022 Rash (typically starting on the face and spreading to other parts of the body). The rash progresses through various stages, turning into fluid-filled blisters that eventually crust over and fall off. Monkeypox: How Is Mpox Transmitted? Dr Sukala mentions how Mpox spreads; some of the common ways include: \u2022 Direct contact with the skin lesions, body fluids, or respiratory droplets of an infected person \u2022 Contact with contaminated objects such as bedding, towels, or clothing \u2022 In rare cases, from animals to humans through bites or direct contact with an infected animal Dr Sukala further says that for pregnant women, there's an additional concern: The virus can cross the placenta, which may lead to complications for the unborn baby. Monkeypox Risk For Pregnant Women Pregnant women may be more vulnerable to complications due to the changes in their immune systems. Dr Sukala lists the potential risks: \u2022 Severe illness \u2022 Preterm birth \u2022 Fetal infection, which can lead to congenital Mpox MPox: Preventive Measures For Pregnant Women 1. Avoid Contact with Infected Individuals: Avoid people with confirmed or suspected Mpox. 2. Practice Good Hygiene: Wash hands regularly with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand sanitiser. 3. Avoid Sharing Personal Items: Do not share bedding, towels, or other personal items with others. 4. Vaccination: Pregnant women should discuss vaccination with their doctor, especially if they are in a high-risk area or exposed to Mpox. While vaccination during pregnancy is typically safe, the decision should be individualized based on risk factors. MPox Prevention: Stay Informed Although Mpox presents a concern for pregnant women, being informed and taking preventive steps can greatly minimise the risks, says Dr Sukala. \"Staying updated on the latest health advisories, practising good hygiene, and avoiding contact with infected individuals are key measures for protection. If any symptoms arise or there is potential exposure to the virus, seeking immediate consultation with a healthcare provider is essential to ensure the safety of both mother and baby. Proactive awareness and timely medical care play a crucial role in reducing complications associated with Mpox during pregnancy,\" says Dr Rekha Sukala.",

My value system is very very important for me, and I will never compromise on that.\" When asked about her debut film and the rumours about Love Sex and Dhoka 2 as her Bollywood debut, she said\" As difficult as it is to understand when it's happening to you, but anything or everything that is meant to be will come to you. When I was on the set of Shaunki, I thought I could have done it 3 years ago because I had offered the Punjabi film before. But something good for you will happen to you at the right time.\" Nimrit has largely worked on TV, we quizzed her about TV being a regressive medium and how it is often criticised for being unorganised, \" I am progressive herself, I picked up Choti Sardaarni because there was no saas-bahu drama. A lot of leading actresses were skeptical about doing Choti as it was a story of a young girl who was pregnant before her marriage and it is such a taboo in our society. It is not like progressive content is not being made, it is, but certainly, some things can change, and it can be a bit more organised. But having said that I also understand the pressure of TRPs on the producers and actors. It is not like anyone is trying to inflict misery on others on purpose. As a medium it is extremely taxing, so maybe we can look at the ways to make it organised than what it is.\" A post shared by Guru Randhawa (@gururandhawa) She further added,\" Content that might be labelled as regressive content is also being consumed by certain sections of the people in the society. Till the time as a whole does not change. The onus of bringing the change cannot be put on the producers, first as a society we should make ourselves progressive, and look at the crimes that have been happening against women surely it's because of lack of education so we need to be the change first.\" We also asked her if there is any reality on Bigg Boss and many actors refuse to be on Salman Khan's show, \"There is of course lack of reality on the reality shows, but the fact is that people do not like to see the reality. Society in general does not like to see the real people, for anyone who goes on the show is mentally prepared to be truly to themselves, people are not kind in general, and you don't want to see vulnerable people. You like to see people project something that you are not 100 per cent, even you if see social media, everyone is protecting. Nobody likes to see that someone having a shit day. To me, it's a double standard. So I wouldn't blame artists, it's people who do not want to see the reality, and try to project the best version of themselves.\" When asked about Asim Riaz's incident on Khatron Ke Khiladi, as she was also a part of the show, she said,\" It's very irrelevant in my day-to-day life, but all I want to say that what happened was very unfortunate and it doesn't happen again.\" A post shared by Nimrrit Kaur Ahluwalia (@nimritahluwalia) Nimrit talks about not doing TV anymore, \"I owe a lot of love from my TV audience, I always want to keep myself connected to them and that is the reason I did Khatron. But as an actor I want to explore and TV is like my home, so I want to grow and challenge myself to do something good. I want to do something on TV as Nimrit but not as a character at the moment. \"",

An order in this regard has been released by the Chief Minister's Office of Odisha. The official order reads, 'All schools and colleges in the Bhubaneshwar metropolitan area will have a complete holiday on September 17. Prime Minister will launch the 'Subhadra Yojana' in Bhubaneshwar during this visit. For this, there will be a huge meeting in Bhubaneswar.

AAP supremo Kejriwal on Sunday announced to resign and not sit on the CM's chair till the people give him a \"certificate of honesty\" and and sought early polls in the National Capital. The BJP has said if Mr. Kejriwal wanted early polls he should get the Delhi Assembly dissolved instead of creating this \"drama\" around his resignation. At Monday's press conference, Mr. Bharadwaj said, \"The ball is in the BJP's court. They can decide on early polls if they are ready to face Kejriwal.\" Delhi elections will be the first polls that will be fought on the plank of \"honesty\", the senior AAP leader said.

Mr. Kejriwal's announcement has led to discussion among common people everywhere, the minister added. \"People are keen to vote quickly and want early elections to choose Kejriwal. There is resentment against BJP. Lord Ram had given up his kingdom and chosen to go on exile for the sake of his ideals. Bharat, who was chosen in his place, waited for Lord Ram to return.

            "description": "In the first 100 days of Modi 3.0, the government has also revised rank-wise pensions under the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme for retirees from the Army, Navy, Air Force and other defence units, as well as for family pensioners, effective July 1, 2024.",
            "content": "In the first 100 days of Modi 3.0, the government has also revised rank-wise pensions under the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme for retirees from the Army, Navy, Air Force and other defence units, as well as for family pensioners, effective July 1, 2024. New Delhi: In the first 100 days of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's new term, the government has given further relief to the middle class on the tax savings and pension fronts. The government has raised the income tax exemption limit to Rs 7 lakh. The standard deduction for salaried individuals has been increased to Rs 75,000, and the exemption limit for family pensions has been raised to Rs 25,000. Also, a comprehensive review of income tax regulations is underway to simplify and streamline the tax system. According to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, within the next few months, there will be a new Tax Code or a new Income Tax Act aimed at reducing litigation. The Tax Code will be simplified in line with the three goals set by Prime Minister Modi -- seamless, painless and faceless. The Finance minister also said that 72 per cent of all the taxpayers have moved to the new and simpler tax system. As the number of income tax returns (ITRs) filed surged to a record 7.28 crore in the assessment year 2024-25, the processing time has also been reduced significantly in the last decade, which is a transformative shift in the tax assessment methodologies in the country. According to Finance Minister Sitharaman, the average processing time of ITR has been reduced from 93 days in 2013 to 10 days now, thereby making refunds faster. Meanwhile, the Union Cabinet, chaired by PM Modi, has approved the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees. This scheme will be effective from April 1, 2025. Under UPS, central government employees can choose between the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) and the National Pension Scheme (NPS). State governments will have the option of choosing between all three schemes, including the Old Pension Scheme (OPS). Under the UPS, if a government employee retires after serving for 25 years, 50 per cent of his basic salary for the last 12 months will be given as a pension. The special thing about this scheme is that it has provisions for an assured pension. If a government employee works for 10 years, at least a Rs 10,000 pension will be paid by the government with indexation benefits. There is also a provision for family pension. If the employee dies after retirement, his family members will receive 60 per cent of his pension. A lump sum amount (apart from gratuity) will also be given on retirement in UPS. It will be calculated as one-tenth of the basic salary and dearness allowance (DA) for every six months of service. More than 23 lakh Central government employees will benefit from this. In the first 100 days of Modi 3.0, the government has also revised rank-wise pensions under the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme for retirees from the Army, Navy, Air Force and other defence units, as well as for family pensioners, effective July 1, 2024.",

            "content": "In the dimly lit auditorium of the Bangalore International Centre, history came alive. On the stage, perched on a simple stool, was Navdeep Suri. Clutched in his hands was a book that held not just words, but 22 year-old Nanak Singh\u2019s haunting eyewitness account of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre preserved and translated by Navdeep from his grandfather\u2019s original work, Khooni Vaisakhi. The audience, a mix of history enthusiasts and those with a personal connection to the past, settled into their seats to be transported back to one one of the darkest days in India\u2019s fight for independence \u2014 April 13, 1919. Navdeep, began by offering some context for the excerpts he was about to read. \u201cThe beauty of the Rowlatt Act was that Gandhi ji didn\u2019t have to be a spin doctor to make people understand that it was unjust. It was so transparently malicious. The massacre was what turned him from a British loyalist to a staunch nationalist.\u201d Khooni Vaisakhi | Photo Credit:Special Arrangement As he read from his translation, the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh unfolded in chilling detail. \u201cFive-thirty sharp, the clock had struck. Thousands gathered in the Bagh, my friends,\u201d he recited, his voice echoing the despair of those trapped in the garden. \u201cUnder tyrant\u2019s orders, they opened fire straight into innocent hearts No exit, no escape, no way out was left, making Bagh a deathly trap.\u201d After each excerpt, the stage was handed over to Harpreet, a singer-songwriter who sang the original Punjabi verses of Nanak Singh\u2019s poems. The haunting lyrics, \u201cWhy open your shops today, my friends, the town will be on strike tomorrow, you\u2019ll catch a hail of bullets, my friends,\u201d filled the room. Harpreet reflected on his first performance on April 13, 2019, at the book release, \u201cThat performance was a spiritual experience. By the end, it almost felt as if I was not singing; rather someone else was singing through me.\u201d This experience led him to create a full album of Nanak Singh\u2019s poems in Khooni Vaisakhi. Navdeep Suri| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Sharing the aftermath of the massacre, Navdeep read, \u201cWith faces drawn and muffled sobs, they sift through the corpses in silent fear. Like moth on a flame, hearts burned to ashes on seeing the fate of sons so dear. My child, oh, wake up just once more. What makes you sleep in a place so grey?\u201d The emotional intensity of the event was not lost on those in attendance such as 81-year-old Brinda Syali, who also witnessed the Partition. \u201cThey created an atmosphere where we felt we were at Jalliananwala Bagh. It gave me goosebumps.\u201d For Navdeep, the significance of Khooni Vaisakhi underscored the broader historical importance of the event and the continuing need to confront and acknowledge the atrocities of the past. \u201cFirst of all, it is for us Indians to remember that freedom came at a price. One of the most egregious parts of our freedom struggle was the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\u201d The massacre also tells the world that the colonial imperial rule is not what the British or others make it out to be, Navdeep said. \u201cThe world should remember that this was the reality of their reign.\u201d As the event drew to a close, the lines of Nanak Singh\u2019s poem lingered in the minds of those present: \u201cLook closely at our bodies, sealed. A thousand wounds you\u2019ll see, oh friends. You stayed at home, reveling in your life, and desired us from your hearts, oh friends.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 12:57 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit The Hindu MetroPlus",

            "content": "Prominent among the controversies at the Olympics this year was a boxing match between Algerian Iman Khelif and Angela Carini, from Italy. The bout, which lasted all of 46 seconds, was won by Khelif and was memorable despite having little to do with pugilism. Accusations flew that she had won because she was a man and, by implication, had cheated. While Khelif was eventually vindicated, this incident was just another pit stop in the long and fractious controversy surrounding sex determination and elite sport. Are the biological categories of \u2018men\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019 sacrosanct? Is the dispute about \u2018woke\u2019 ideas contesting for publicity? How accurate is the science on sex-determination? What is the origin-story of these controversies? The Rearview is a podcast where the hosts guide you on a scenic route through the history of science. Filled with fascinating anecdotes, deep archival dives, and a closer look at the quirky minds behind groundbreaking ideas.

            "content": "The West Bengal government on Monday again invited agitating junior doctors to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's residence in Kolkata at 5 p.m. today (September 16, 2024) to hold a meeting to resolve the R.G. Kar rape case impasse. In a mail, Chief Secretary Manoj Pant said representatives of the junior doctors have been invited to the meeting. The protesting resident doctors had visited the residence of Ms. Banerjee on Saturday (September 14, 2024) for a meeting, but could not hold any discussion as the impasse over live streaming or video recording of the proceedings continued. The State government said recording or streaming cannot be allowed inside the Chief Minister\u2019s residence because of security concerns. After the last meeting was cancelled, the doctors said they had accepted all the \u2018conditions\u2019 laid out for the discussions but the authorities turned them down as it had gotten too late. \u2018Final time\u2019 In his letter to the doctors today, Chief Secretary Manoj Pant said that it was the \u201cfifth and final time\u201d the government was reaching out for a meeting. \u201cThis is the fifth and final time we are reaching out to you for a meeting between the Honourable Chief Minister and your delegates. In line with our discussion from the day before, we are once again inviting you to a meeting with the Honourable Chief Minister at her Kalighat residence for a discussion with an open mind,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe trust that good sense will prevail, and as mutually agreed and as per your statement to the media day before \u2014 there will be no live streaming or videography of the meeting, given that the matter is subjudice in the highest court of the country. Instead, the minutes of the meeting will be recorded and signed by both parties,\u201d he added. He invited the same delegation that arrived on Saturday to reach the Chief Minister\u2019s home at 4.45 p.m. The agitating junior doctors continued their sit-in outside Swasthya Bhawan, the headquarters of the health department, for the eight day and cease work for the 36th day.

            "description": "Omkar Music School is all set to celebrate its 10th anniversary with a grand musical festival",
            "content": "The upcoming three-day Omkar Music Fest at Prestige Shantiniketan, marks the 10th anniversary of Omkar Music School led by Hindustani vocalist Iman Das. In the past decade, the school has trained nearly a thousand students across the globe. While the celebrations will see performances from youngsters on all days, one can expect performances from star artistes such as sitarist Ustad Shafique Khan from Dharwad and Partha Bose from Kolkata, a tabla solo by Ustad Najmuddin Javed, Mohiniyattam and Kathak performances by Rekha Raju and Snigda DS respectively, and a presentation of thumri, dadra, kajri and chalti from Iman Das himself. Iman says he is happy that Hindustani vocalist and Muddu Mohan, a retired IAS officer, and disciple of Basavaraj Rajguru and Gangubhai Hangal, will be performing at the festival this year. \u201cThis annual fest is growing by the year and we have nearly 50 artistes participating in the three-day festival. Apart from a wide range of music and dance styles, including bhajans and bhavageete, there will also be a painting competition for children themed around music.\u201d Shafique Khan| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Santoor maestro Madan Oak will be coming from the US for the occasion, and a team trained by Carnatic veena expert Suma Sudhindra will be performing as will electric guitarist Swarnabha Gupta from Pune. Amongst Iman\u2019s senior students who will be participating in the event are Hindustani vocalists Asmita Banerjee and Ankita Kundu. Iman, who undertook advanced lessons from Pt. Ajay Chakrabarty (a student of Munawwar Ali Khan) and Pt. Shantanu Bhattacharya, today has students from around the world. \u201cEach gharana brings a new approach to music, its interpretation or form, embellishing the existing structure. My lineage belongs to the Patiala gharana.\u201d Seed of a dream \u201cI want to see if the IT city of Bengaluru can be a parallel IC (Indian Classical) city and I am working towards this from our Academy.\u201d One of the aspects of the Omkar Music Academy, Iman adds, is the housing of lessons that discusses all systems of world music, apart from Indian classical Hindustani which is taught in all its forms here. \u201cI have a lot of Western music enthusiasts as my students and the best way to teach them is to make them sing in their own genre, even as I follow the Indian system of swaras and ragas. No other system can do this except our Sur-based musical scale that can be notated in its exactitude.\u201d Any world genre can be notated, Iman says, through the Sur-based seven notes and this system helps students of other genres understand the melodic framework and tonality of a piece. \u201cAt our music school we get students to cherish and value Indian musical systems.\u201d Iman Das| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Brought up in Kolkata, Iman Das settled in Bengaluru after his work received a good response from the city that, \u201cembraces new aspects of culture and music with a broader acceptance.\u201d A love for new ragas Iman\u2019s penchant for new ragas and composing began in childhood when he was drawn to sitarist Pandit Ravishankar\u2019s innovative masterpiece, Raag Parameshwari. \u201cThe scale just haunts you; when I wrote a musical on Devi Indira, believed to be an incarnation of Meerabhai, I used it for the song \u2018Maa Meera\u2019.\u201d The track became an instant hit and was acknowledged by WNYR New York Radio in the \u2018World\u2019s Top Emerging Artistes\u2019 category for special song /Sanskrit shloka. \u201cThe fusion of two great scales here make it an interesting study for learners to contemplate its winding flow,\u201d he says. His own raga innovations have been Swarnadesi, Vishwa Bahar and Swarnamadhu that artistes such as Anup Jalota, Amit Kumar, Venkatesh Kumar and others have appreciated. Suma Sudhindra| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Iman also selected Swarnadeshi for \u2018Ek Bharat Hum\u2019 a song he wrote and created for nine visually impaired music students he trained as Team Sunaada that performed at the closing ceremony of the Para-Olympic Games in Paris recently. Iman, who has performed on global stages, is a recipient of this year\u2019s Basavaraj Rajguru National Puraskar as well as the Karnataka recipient of \u2018Bhasha-e-kala Samman\u2019 (Linguistic Art Award) presented on September 14 at Varanasi. The award instituted by Hindustan Samachar, the Varanashi Journalists Forum, was for his book One Nation, One Music: Ek Bharat, Ek Sangeet and his contribution to music. \u201cI am happy to be recognised, but the success of a true musician lies in understanding the perfect \u2018sur\u2019 in the ocean of melodies we are exposed to. Also, every guru has to pass on this understanding to his students.\u201d Omkar Music Festival will be at Algorithm, Nexus Shantiniketan Mall, from September 20 to 22. From 4pm-9pm.

            "content": "The Cyber Crime Wing of Greater Chennai City Police has booked a case against Kantharaj, a commentator, for his interview on a YouTube channel in which he alleged that several actresses in Tamil film industry had \u2018made adjustments\u2019 with film-makers to get roles in movies. The case was registered following a complaint from actor Rohini to the City Police Commissioner A. Arun. Ms. Rohini is the president of the gender sensitisation and internal complaints committee (ICC) of South Indian Artists\u2019 Association (SIAA). In her complaint, which was lodged on Friday (September 13, 2024,) she said Kantharaj had demeaned women with his obscene words. Stating that the interview had shown the women in the film industry in a poor light, she sought that the police register a criminal complaint against Kantharaj and initiate steps to remove the video from YouTube. The complaint was forwaded to the Cyber Crime Wing for further action, and a case was registered against Kantharaj under Sections 296 (Obscene Acts) 75(1)(iv) (Making Sexually Coloured Remarks) 79(Word, gesture, or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 352 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and Section 67 (Punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act.

            "content": "The Railway Ministry renamed the Vande Metro hours before launch by PM Modi in Gujarat. Hours before the flagging off ceremony of the Bhuj-Ahmedabad Vande Metro, the Railway Ministry renamed it to Namo Bharat Rapid Rail on Monday, a ministry spokesperson said. The metro service will be launched from the Bhuj railway station at 4:15 p.m. virtually by Prime Minister Modi, who will be present in Ahmedabad. Namo Bharat Rapid Rail Renamed: Details The Rapid Rail, designed to improve intercity connectivity, is set to traverse a 359 km route between Bhuj and Ahmedabad in 5 hours and 45 minutes, with scheduled stops at nine stations along the way. The regular service will be made available for the public from September 17 Ahmedabad. The journey is expected to cost Rs 455 for the complete route. The Railway Ministry has announced that the Vande Metro will be renamed Namo Bharat Rapid Rail, according to a spokesperson. Unlike other metro trains that cover shorter routes, Namo Bharat will link central Ahmedabad with nearby cities, the ministry stated. The Rapid Rail, equipped with 12 coaches and seating for 1,150 passengers, boasts several modern features. According to officials, it includes ergonomically designed seats, fully air-conditioned cabins, and modular interiors, making it a more advanced option compared to other metro trains. \"The train offers faster journeys between mid-distance cities. Its rapid acceleration and deceleration contribute to efficient travel while driving cabs at both ends eliminates turnaround time,\" it added. (With PTI inputs)",

            "description": "Costume designer Anu Parthasarathy speaks about collaborating with Vidya Balan and their creative journey for the project, A Recreation of Iconic Styles, which pays tribute to renowned Carnatic singer MS Subbulakshmi.",
            "content": "In 1951, MS Subbulakshmi made her way to Nalli Silks with a blue thread in hand, hoping to have a sari made of the same colour. The colour of the sari then specially woven for her, was so unique that it went on to be referred to as MS Blue. Till date, people walk into silk sari stores, referring to MS Blue, seeking out the exact same shade of inky, iridescent blue. In a tribute to the legendary Carnatic singer, whose voice, and sartorial sense has inspired generations since, actor Vidya Balan collaborated with Chennai-based costume designer Anu Parthasarthy, who has worked on several films across languages, for a photographic tribute to mark MS Subbulakshmi\u2019s 108th birth anniversary. \u201cGrowing up, my mom would play \u2018Suprabhatam\u2019 sung by her, first thing in the morning. My everyday still begins with her voice. For me, MS Subbulakshmi is a spiritual experience. Therefore, this has been a labour of love, and an honour to be able to pay tribute this way,\u201d Vidya says. Anu Parthasarathy with Vidya Balan| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement The idea for this project, titled A Recreation of Iconic Styles, began nearly seven years ago. \u201cThis came from a casual conversation I had with Vidya, where she was telling me how she would love to play the singer in a biopic, if the opportunity came up. I was also keen on doing something out of the box, and kept coming back to this conversation we had,\u201d Anu recalls, of their creative journey. She had previously worked on Vidya\u2019s costumes for Bhool Bhulaiyaa , and Guru . \u201cI was able to visualise Vidya as a younger MS amma and began to work on the look. They both have similarly beautiful, pear-shaped faces. Vidya\u2019s ability to embody a character completely, also made her the ideal choice for this,\u201d she says. Having met MS Subbulakshmi in the past, Anu recalls being mesmerised by her grace and poise. \u201cSomething that also struck me was how unique her sari drape was. It looked like a nine yards sari, but was actually six yards. Her saris were all in traditional, bright colours, and remain iconic to this day,\u201d she says. While she got started with looking at images available online and in books, Anu credits renowned flautist Mala Chandrasekhar, the granddaughter-in-law of MS Subbulakshmi for her invaluable insights and guidance through the process of putting together four different looks for the photos, shot by Rohn Pingalay. \u201cMany photos, for instance, were in black and white. But Mala ma\u2019am helped me identify the right colours and shades for the saris. I learnt from her that the singer used to wear saris woven by Muthu Chettiar, a weaver from Madurai in the early days, and later, saris from Nalli Chinnasami Chetty,\u201d she says. The creative journey involved meticulous research by Anu for the saris she wore during the Sixties and the Seventies. Vidya Balan as MS Subbulakshmi in the iconic MS Blue sari| Photo Credit:Rohn Pingalay From a number of saris that are considered favourites, four were chosen for the photo tribute, each significant in its own way. The iconic MS blue sari that Vidya wore was sourced from the original weaver Nalli Chinnasami Chetty in Chennai. While celebrated through the years, the uniqueness of the saris worn by the singer also meant having to go the custom route, to get it recreated. Anu says that Subhashini Srinivasan, proprietrix and design head, The S Studio Clothing coordinated the weaving process for the three other saris.

For the recreation series, the sari was woven by D Srinivasan from Sri Balavinayagar Silks in Kanchipuram. Vidya in a recreation of the blue pearl square sari| Photo Credit:Rohn Pingalay The striking blue pearl square sari (muthu kattam sari), which as its name suggests, features pearl squares on the body. \u201cUnlike today\u2019s saris which have a broad zari or many lines of zari on the border, the saris of that period maintained a more simplistic style which added to its allure. This was a concert favourite,\u201d Anu said, of the sari, which was recreated by weaver V Balakrishnan in Kanchipuram. In a recreation of the Ramar green sari| Photo Credit:Rohn Pingalay Of the popular Ramar Pacchai (green) sari with a mustard yellow border which was recreated by weaver D Srinivasan, Anu recalls struggling to find the right shade, and going through several samples before zeroing in on the right colours. \u201cMala ma\u2019am had a similar silk cotton sari, and gave me a piece of fabric from it which I used as a reference. This is a popular colour as well, something you can hear being asked for in sari shops. The original sari had a fascinating dual combination of sea-green and middle-sea blue with a mustard oil border colour,\u201d Anu says, adding that two weavers were needed to operate the loom simultaneously to achieve these contrasting colours. From the size of the ring on her left ring finger, the much loved mookuthi or nose studs she sported on her nose, her hair in a bun adorned with flowers, and the exact shade of kumkum on her forehead were other aspects of the look that they worked on. Her simple accessories complimented the vibrant, bright saris she used to wear. \u201cMS Subbulakshmi\u2019s simple stage persona would always shine through, and we had to keep this in mind while recreating her looks,\u201d says Anu. The photographic tribute and Vidya\u2019s portrayal of MS Subbalakshmi is not merely a superficial imitation, but a deep appreciation for the singer\u2019s artistry, the team that worked on this tribute said.

            "content": "India's superstar athlete ended the 2024 season at the second spot by a margin of 1 cm in the Diamond League final. He threw his javelin 87.86m long in his third attempt while the eventual winner Anderson Peters came up with an 87.87m throw. After the event, Neeraj took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal that he had fractured the fourth metacarpal of his left hand but was able to play with the help of his team. The main question that arises here is - Was there a need to play for Neeraj Chopra with an injury? Was the Diamond League tournament so important for him? Paris Olympics gold medallist Arshad Nadeem hasn't participated in any of the tournaments since the Games while the defending champion of the Diamond League, Jakub Vadlejch, also withdrew from the final for unknown reasons. Neeraj's closest competitors didn't feature in the Diamond League while the 26-year-old participated in the last round to make it to the final at the fourth place. It is well known to everyone that Neeraj struggled with a groin injury before the Olympics and managed it during the Games too. He had to settle for a silver medal eventually with Pakistan's Arshad recording the all-time Olympics throw. He is set to undergo the surgery for the same soon and the fresh injury to his left hand is likely to make the recovery period long for Neeraj. In this situation, should Neeraj have skipped playing after the Olympics? Has he risked aggravating both his injuries by participating in the Diamond League? Well, only time will tell whether his recovery period will be extended. Neeraj Chopra himself cleared in his tweet that he wanted to finish the season on track and also admitted that he couldn't meet his expectations this season. Well, then he will be gunning to return fully fit next year and breach that 90m mark that eluded him throughout the 2024 season. 88.35m at Doha Diamond League - 2nd place (May 10) 82.27m at Federation Cup, India - 1st place (May 15) 85.97m at Paavo Nurmi Games - 1st place (June 18) 89.34m at Paris 2024 Olympics (Qualification) - August 6 89.45m at Paris 2024 Olympics (Final) - August 8 89.49m at Lausanne Diamond League - 2nd place (August 22) 87.86m at Brussels Diamond League (Final) - 2nd place (September 14)",

The incident reportedly took place on September 13, Friday, and the boy took up the issue with his parents who lodged a complaint with the Chief Educational Officer T. Sampath. Officials said the complaint was that the commerce teacher had erased the lessons she wrote on the blackboard and the boy could not copy it down in his notebook. When he raised the issue with the teacher, she took up the issue with the headmaster who allegedly slapped the boy. The boy fell down and he was sent home, officials said. His parents admitted him to the Government Headquarters Hospital in Erode and took up the issue with the CEO. However, no police complaint was lodged. Mr. Sampath told The Hindu that a departmental inquiry has begun on Monday and based on the report, further action would be taken.

            "description": "The CBI, probing the case, arrested the former principal on September 2 in connection with financial irregularities at the hospital. Charges of evidence tampering were added later against him",
            "content": "RG Kar Medical College's former principal Sandip Ghosh was found to be \"deceptive\" while answering important questions on the rape and murder of a trainee woman postgraduate doctor during his polygraph test and layered voice analysis, officials said. The CBI, probing the case, arrested Ghosh on September 2 in connection with financial irregularities at the hospital. The federal probe agency later added charges of evidence tampering against him. During the investigation, Ghosh was subjected to layered voice analysis and polygraph test. According to a report from Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), New Delhi, his version has been found to be \"deceptive on certain important issues\" relating to this case, officials in the know of the developments said. Information revealed during the polygraph test may not be used as evidence during the trial but the agency may gather corroborative evidence which could be used in court, they said. Also read | Former R.G. Kar hospital principal had criminal nexus with co-accused for wrongful gains: CBI A polygraph test can help in assessing inaccuracies in the statements of suspects and witnesses. By monitoring their psychological responses, heart rate, breathing pattern, sweating and blood pressure, investigators can determine if there are discrepancies in their responses. The CBI has alleged that Ghosh got information about the rape and murder of the trainee doctor at 9.58 am on August 9 but he did not make the police complaint immediately. He allegedly made a \"vague complaint\" at a later stage through the medical superintendent-vice principal even though the victim was declared dead at 12.44 p.m., they said. \"He did not try to get an FIR lodged immediately. Rather a new theory of suicide was introduced which is not possible as per external injury visible on the body of the victim that was undressed at the lower part,\" the CBI has alleged. The probe agency has alleged that Ghosh got in touch with Tala Police Station's Officer In Charge (OC) Abhijit Mondal at 10.03 a.m. and with an advocate at 1.40 p.m. while a case of unnatural death was registered at 11.30 pm. Mondal, who has also been arrested by CBI in connection with the case, received information of the incident at 10.03 a.m. on August 9 but did not reach the scene of the crime immediately, the officials claimed, adding the OC reached the spot after an hour. The general diary entry 542 mentioned that the body of the PG trainee of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital was found lying in an \"unconscious state\" in the seminar room of chest medicine, whereas the body was already examined by a doctor who had found the victim dead. The general diary entry was allegedly made \"in conspiracy with hospital authorities and other unknown persons\", intentionally mentioning wrong details. Mondal's failure to register an FIR and protect the scene of crime resulted in the \"damage of vital evidence available at the crime scene\", officials said, adding he tried to protect the accused Sanjay Roy and others who had unauthorised access to the scene of crime that might have led to tampering of evidence. Ghosh allegedly directed subordinates to send the body to the morgue hurriedly, they said. The trainee doctor was allegedly raped and murdered in the seminar hall of R G Kar Medical College and Hospital when she had gone to rest during her shift in the early hours of August 9. Her body with severe injury marks was found in the hall by a doctor who was on rounds. Sanjay Roy, a police volunteer, was arrested the next day based on CCTV footage in which he was seen entering the seminar hall at 4.03 a.m. on the day of the incident. On August 13, the Calcutta High Court ordered the transfer of the probe from the Kolkata Police to the CBI, which took over the case on August 14.

            "content": "West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee again invited the protesting doctors for meeting at 5 pm to break the deadlock. In a letter, Bengal Chief Secretary requested the agitating doctors to meet Mamata Banerjee at her Kalighat residence for a \"discussion with an open mind\". \"We trust that good sense will prevail, and as mutually agreed and as per your statement to the media day before, there will be no live streaming or videography of the meeting, given that the matter is sub judice in the highest court of the country. Instead, the minutes of the meeting will be recorded and signed by both parties,\" the letter said. The development comes at a time when the agitating junior doctors continued with their cease work, stating that they would remain steadfast in their resolve to pursue justice for the medic raped and murdered at the RG Kar hospital. For the eight day on Monday, the doctors continued their sit-in outside Swasthya Bhawan, the headquarters of the Health department, and contonued cease work for the 36th day and vowed to continue it till their demands - the removal of Kolkata Police Commissioner and senior state health officials are met. \"We will continue our cease work till our demands are met. The state government is not serious about resolving the crisis,\" an agitating junior medic said. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on Saturday made a surprise visit to the site where the doctors were protesting and assured them that their demands would be addressed, but the proposed meeting fell through, with the protesters claiming that they were asked to leave \"unceremoniously\" after waiting for three hours at the gates of the CM's residence. Another protesting doctor claimed they had agreed to attend the meeting without live-streaming or video recording as Banerjee requested, but after notifying Minister of State for Health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, of this decision, they were told to leave because it was too late. A few previous attempts at talks between the junior doctors and Banerjee had also failed due to disagreements over live streaming of the meetings and the number of attending representatives. The body of the postgraduate woman doctor was recovered in the seminar hall of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been conducting the probe into the rape and murder of the woman medic, following a Calcutta High Court order.",

There are over 60,000 Ganesha idols installed across Karnataka, and the celebrations are on in full swing. It is a single isolated incident. The police officers will handle it effectively. We should not blow it out of proportion,\u201d he told reporters in Belagavi on September 15. To a query, Satish Jarkiholi said that the arrest of BJP MLA Munirathna was not politically motivated. \u201cHe has been seen using abusive language against some persons, including some women. Did the Congress ask him to do that? It is wrong to say that the arrest is politically motivated,\u201d he said. He said that the financial burden on the Belagavi city corporation had been reduced as the urban local body had decided to return land to the owners rather than take up work of widening a road.

The villagers were seen going with their belongings, including livestock, in vans. According to officials, these villagers are \"illegal settlers in the tribal belt\". \u201cMost of the alleged encroachers have land in other districts, such as Darrang, Morigaon and Barpeta and have started returning to their homes there,\u201d the officials said. The Kamrup (Metropolitan) district authorities have set September 16 as a deadline to vacate the Kochutoli village. \u201cEviction notices were served to those \u201cillegally occupying government land\u201d and stringent action would be taken against those who would remain there after the deadline,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cA team from the Sonapur Circle office and the police had gone to Kochutoli village to evict Bengali-speaking Muslim villagers, who had previously been removed from the encroached land but had again returned there,\u201d he said. During the eviction drive, the villagers, including women, had attacked the officials and policemen with sharp weapons, sticks and stones on September 12. Two villagers were killed and more than 35 people, including 22 government officials and police personnel, were injured in the violence. The police opened fire to disperse the mob. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the laws related to the tribal belts and blocks were promulgated when Gopinath Bordoloi was the first Congress CM in 1950 and this particular area has been under the tribal belt since then. Mr. Sarma had said the eviction drive in the area would continue. ''We will clear the tribal belts and blocks of all encroachment by doubtful illegal settlers,\" he said. He had alleged that the Congress \"instigated people to come out and attack the officials and police personnel on duty'', Mr. Sarma said. Director General of Police G. P. Singh said the attack on police personnel was suspected to be a case of ''conspiracy'' by a certain section as the eviction was continuing peacefully since September 9. Meanwhile, separate delegations of the Congress and AIUDF MLAs were prevented by pro-eviction tribal organisations from entering the village on Saturday (September 14, 2024.) The Congress alleged that the State Government has \"violated court orders by not issuing relevant notice for eviction from Government land as there is a ruling by both the Supreme Court and Gauhati High Court in this regard\".

            "description": "The border controls will be in place for an initial six months and are expected to include temporary structures at land crossings and spot checks by federal police; interior ministry however noted that travellers should carry identification when crossing the border",
            "content": "Germany will expand border controls to the frontiers from Monday (September 16, 2024) with all nine of its neighbours to stop irregular migrants in a move that has sparked protests from other European Union members. Berlin announced the sweeping measure following a string of deadly extremist attacks that have stoked public fears and boosted support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party . Interior Minister Nancy Faeser on Sunday (September 15, 2024) said that the step aimed to limit irregular migration and \"put a stop to criminals and identify and stop Islamists at an early stage\". The border controls will be in place for an initial six months and are expected to include temporary structures at land crossings and spot checks by federal police. Poland and Austria have voiced concern and the European Commission has warned that members of the 27-nation bloc must only impose such steps in exceptional circumstances. Germany lies at the heart of Europe and borders nine countries that are part of the visa-free Schengen zone , designed to allow the free movement of people and goods. Border controls with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland were already in place before the crackdown was announced. These will now be expanded to Germany's borders with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Faeser said the government hoped to minimise the impact on people living and working in border regions, promising \"coordination with our neighbouring countries\". The interior ministry however noted that travellers should carry identification when crossing the border. Islamist attacks In recent weeks, a string of extremist attacks have shocked Germany, fuelling rising public anger. Last month, a man on a knife rampage killed three people and wounded eight more at a festival in the western city of Solingen. The Syrian suspect, who has alleged links to the Islamic State group, had been intended for deportation but managed to evade authorities. The enforcement failure set off a bitter debate which marked the run-up to two regional polls in the formerly communist east, where the anti-immigration AfD scored unprecedented results. With national elections looming next year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government has been under intense political pressure to toughen its stance on migrants and asylum seekers. Mr. Scholz was in Uzbekistan on Sunday to sign a migration deal for workers to come to Germany, while simplifying deportation procedures in the opposite direction so that \"those that must go back do go back\", the chancellor said. Closer to home, the German government has presented plans to speed up deportations to European partners. Under EU rules, asylum requests are meant to be handled by the country of arrival. The system has placed a huge strain on countries on the European periphery, where leaders have demanded more burden-sharing. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that Germany tightening its borders means that it would \"essentially pass the buck to countries located on the outer borders of Europe\". Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said his country \"will not accept people who are rejected from Germany\", while Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk condemned Germany's move as \"unacceptable\". 'Welcome to the club' Warsaw has also struggled with migration and accused Moscow of smuggling people from Africa and the Middle East into Europe by sending them through Belarus to the Polish border. Berlin on Friday said that Mr. Tusk and Mr. Scholz had discussed the issue and agreed to strengthen EU external borders, \"especially in view of the cynical instrumentalisation of migrants by Belarus\". Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, meanwhile, mocked the German chancellor on social media site X, writing: \"Bundeskanzler Scholz, welcome to the club! #StopMigration.\" Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-16, many of them Syrians, and has hosted over a million Ukrainians since the start of the Russian invasion in 2022. The extra burden on municipal authorities and integration services in Germany needed to be \"taken into account\" when talking about new border controls, Berlin's interior ministry said. In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Dick Schoof on Friday unveiled the country's strictest migration policy yet, saying it will request an opt-out from EU common policy on asylum next week. A four-party coalition dominated by far-right firebrand Geert Wilders's Freedom Party wants to declare an \"asylum crisis\" to curb the influx of migrants through a tough set of rules including border controls.

According to the Railway Ministry, while the other metros cover only short distances, Namo Bharat trains will connect the heart of Ahmedabad with its peripheral cities. Featuring 12 coaches with seating for 1,150 passengers, the Rapid Rail offers a host of innovative features, it said. \"With ergonomically designed seats, fully air-conditioned cabins and modular interiors, it definitely proves to be superior to other metros.\" A significant upgrade, according to the Ministry, from traditional suburban trains and metro coaches is its modular design that includes ejector-based vacuum evacuation toilets. \"The train offers faster journeys between mid-distance cities.

            "description": "The U.S. government and TikTok will go head-to-head in federal court on Monday as oral arguments begin in a consequential legal case that will determine the future of TikTok in the country",
            "content": "The U.S. government and TikTok will go head-to-head in federal court on Monday as oral arguments begin in a consequential legal case that will determine if \u2013 or how \u2014 a popular social media platform used by nearly half of all Americans will continue to operate in the country. Attorneys for the two sides will appear before a panel of judges at the federal appeals court in Washington. TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, are challenging a U.S. law that requires them to break ties or face a ban in the U.S. by mid-January. The legal battle is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was a culmination of a years-long saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China. But TikTok argues the law runs afoul of the First Amendment while other opponents claim it mirrors crackdowns sometimes seen in authoritarian countries abroad. In court documents submitted over the summer, the Justice Department emphasised the government\u2019s two primary concerns. First, TikTok collects vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Second, the U.S. says the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. TikTok has repeatedly said it does not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government and that concerns the government has raised have never been substantiated. In court documents, attorneys for both TikTok and its parent company have argued that members of Congress sought to punish the platform based on propaganda they perceived to be on TikTok. The companies also claimed divestment is not possible and that the app would have to shut down by January 19 if the courts don\u2019t step in to block the law. \u201cEven if divestiture were feasible, TikTok in the United States would still be reduced to a shell of its former self, stripped of the innovative and expressive technology that tailors content to each user,\u201d the companies said in a legal brief filed in June. \u201cIt would also become an island, preventing Americans from exchanging views with the global TikTok community.\u201d Opponents of the law stress a ban would also cause disruptions in the world of marketing, retail and in the lives of many different content creators, some of whom also sued the government in May. TikTok is covering the legal costs for that lawsuit, which the court has consolidated with the company\u2019s complaint and another filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Though the government\u2019s primary reasoning for the law is public, significant portions of its court filings include classified information that has been redacted and hidden from public view. The companies have asked the court to reject the secret filings or appoint a district judge who can ferret through the material, which the government has opposed because it will cause a delay in the case. If admitted into the court, legal experts say those secret filings could make it nearly impossible to know some of the factors that could play a part in the eventual ruling. In one of the redacted statements submitted in late July, the Justice Department claimed TikTok took direction from the Chinese government about content on its platform, without disclosing additional details about when or why those incidents occurred. Casey Blackburn, a senior U.S. intelligence official, wrote in a legal statement that ByteDance and TikTok \u201chave taken action in response\u201d to Chinese government demands \u201cto censor content outside of China.\u201d Though the intelligence community had \u201cno information\u201d that this has happened on the platform operated by TikTok in the U.S., Blackburn said there is a risk it \u201cmay\u201d occur. In a separate document submitted to court, the DOJ said the U.S. is \u201cnot required to wait until its foreign adversary takes specific detrimental actions before responding to such a threat.\u201d The companies, however, argue the government could have taken a more tailored approach to resolve its concerns. During high-stakes negotiations with the Biden administration more than two years ago, TikTok presented the government with a draft 90-page agreement that allows a third party to monitor the platform\u2019s algorithm, content moderation practices and other programming. TikTok says it has spent more than $2 billion to voluntarily implement some of these measures, which include storing U.S. user data on servers controlled by the tech giant Oracle. But it said a deal was not reached because government officials essentially walked away from the negotiating table in August 2022. Justice officials have argued complying with the draft agreement is impossible, or would require extensive resources, due to the size and the technical complexity of TikTok. The Justice Department also said the only thing that would resolve the government\u2019s concerns is severing the ties between TikTok and ByteDance given the porous relationship between the Chinese government and Chinese companies. But some observers have wondered whether such a move would accelerate the so-called \u201cdecoupling\u201d between the U.S. and its strategic rival at a time when other China-founded companies, such as Shein and Temu, are also making a big splash in the West. Last week, the Biden administration proposed rules that would crack down on duty-free products being shipped directly from China. For its part, ByteDance has publicly said TikTok is not up for sale. But that has not stopped some investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, from announcing bids to purchase the platform. However, even if such a sale would occur, it would most likely be devoid of TikTok's coveted algorithm, leaving a big question mark on whether the platform would be capable of serving up the type of personally tailored videos that users have come to expect. The political alignments on the issue are playing out in unconventional ways. The law, which passed with bipartisan approval in Congress, had encountered resistance from some progressive and Republican lawmakers who voiced concerns about giving the government the power to ban a platform used by 170 million Americans. Former President Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok while in office, is now opposing a ban because that would help its rival, Facebook, a platform Trump continues to criticise over his 2020 election loss. In court, free speech and social justice groups have submitted amicus briefs in support of TikTok, arguing it restricts the First Amendment rights of users and suppresses the speech of minority communities by disrupting a tool many of them use to advocate for causes online. Some libertarian groups with ties to ByteDance investor Jeff Yass have also filed briefs supporting the company. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has received the backing of more than 20 Republican attorneys general, former national security officials and China-focused human rights groups who are asking the court to uphold the law.

            "content": "Indian police have detained around 100 striking workers and union leaders protesting low wages at a Samsung Electronics plant in Chennai, as they were planning a march on Monday (September 16, 2024) without permission, police officials said. The detention marks an escalation of a strike by workers at a Samsung home appliance plant near Chennai. Workers want higher wages and have boycotted work for seven days, disrupting production that contributes roughly a third of Samsung's annual India revenue of $12 billion. A senior police official of Kancheepuram district, Sankar Ganesh, told Reuters by telephone that around 100 workers were under \"preventive arrest\", without elaborating. Another police officer on condition of anonymity said the detentions were made due to a lack of permission to hold a protest march. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment. Workers have since last week been protesting at a makeshift tent near the plant, demanding higher wages, recognition for a union backed by labour group Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and better working hours. Samsung is not keen to recognise any union backed by an outside labour group. A. Jenitan, a union leader of CITU, told Reuters that police also detained one of their senior leaders, E. Muthukumar, who was leading the Samsung protests. \"The workers have been asked to return to the (strike) tent,\" he said.

            "content": "A security team- which consists of 20 personnel guard the billionaire tech magnate that is being called by the name \u201cVoyager\u201d. New Delhi: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a heavy security entourage around him that even follows him to the bathroom of the X (formerly) headquarters, a New York Times report has revealed. A security team- which consists of 20 personnel guard the billionaire tech magnate that is being called by the name \u201cVoyager\u201d. \"Mr. Musk, who was once flanked by two bodyguards, travels with as many as 20 security professionals who show up to research escape routes or to clear a room before he enters. They often carry guns and have a medical professional in tow for Mr. Musk, who has been code-named \u201cVoyager\u201d by his security team,\" the New York Times reported. Elon Musk's Company has paid millions of dollars for providing tight security to the tech billionaire. The New York Times has accessed invoices and receipts that said, \"This year, Tesla disclosed in filings for the first time that it paid $2.4 million for a portion of Mr. Musk\u2019s protection in 2023. It paid $500,000 in the first two months of 2024, more than five times the average spent every two months in 2019, according to Tesla documents. From 2015 to 2018, Mr. Musk spent an average $145,000 a month on security\". The Tesla and SpaceX CEO had in 2022 created a lot of tumult among Twitter user by posting a very cryptic tweet on death. Musk referred to dying under under \"mysterious circumstances\". Musk tweeted, \"If I die under mysterious circumstances, it's been nice knowin ya\". If I die under mysterious circumstances, it\u2019s been nice knowin ya\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2022 Though the Tech billionaire is well known for his baffling posts on Twitter, the above quote seems to have some relation to the tweet Musk had posted before the \"mysterious circumstances\" quote. The word \u201cNazi\u201d doesn\u2019t mean what he seems to think it does pic.twitter.com/pk9SQhBOsG \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2022 In the above post, that appears to be a communication from a Russian officer, Musk shares excerpts of some strong warning of sorts. The post warns how Musk \"will be held accountable\" for his involvement in \"supplying the fascist forces in Ukraine with military communication equipment\". \"Elon Musk, thus, is involved in supplying the fascist forces in Ukraine with military communication equipment. And for this, Elon, you will be held accountable like an adult - no matter how much you'll play the fool,\" said the last para of the post.",

In India, where discussions about periods are still considered taboo in many communities, this silence has done more harm than good. Menstruation is a natural, biological process, but for many women, it is surrounded by myths, shame, and lack of support. Matri, a revolutionary startup, is not only providing an effective solution to period pain with Matri's Period Pain Relief Device, but also challenging and dismantling the deeply ingrained taboos surrounding menstruation in India.",

            "content": "With two goals in less than 10 minutes, Lamine Yamal led Barcelona to its fifth straight victory at the start of the Spanish league season. The teenager's double, plus second-half goals from Dani Olmo and Pedri, gave Barcelona a commanding 4-1 win at Catalan rival Girona on Sunday (September 15, 2024), keeping a four-point lead at the top. Atletico Madrid kept pace by beating last-place Valencia 3-0 with goals from Antoine Griezmann and newly signed players Julia\u0301n A\u0301lvarez and Conor Gallagher, while Real Madrid had won 2-0 at Real Sociedad on Saturday with goals from Kylian Mbappe\u0301 and Vini\u0301cius Ju\u0301nior. Along with Atletico and Madrid, Villarreal was the other team four points behind Barcelona after winning 2-1 at Mallorca on Saturday. \u201cTo help the team it's important to score the goals and to do whatever is needed,\u201d Yamal said. \u201cThe first match after the international break is always complicated. Now we can start focusing on the match against Monaco (in the Champions League on Thursday).\u201d Yamal's goals on Sunday were his second and third of the season. The 17-year-old Spain international opened the scoring after stealing the ball from a defender and sending a close-range shot into the net in the 30th minute. He scored again in the 37th after picking up a loose ball inside the area. Olmo's third goal since joining Barcelona this season came from a tight angle in the 47th, and Pedri sealed the easy victory with a goal from inside the area in the 64th. Olmo, who had to be replaced in the second half because of a right leg injury, became the first player to score in his first three league games for Barcelona since Cesc Fabregas in 2011. Only Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in 2009, achieved the same feat this century. Cristhian Stuani scored Girona's lone goal in the 80th. The hosts were initially awarded a penalty kick for a handball inside the area just before halftime, with Barcelona leading 2-0, but the call was reversed by video review. Barcelona played with 10 men from the 87th after Ferran Torres was sent off for a hard foul on an opponent. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski played his 100th match with Barcelona. Girona, a surprise third-place finisher last season, won both league games against Barcelona last season. Newly signed Argentina forward A\u0301lvarez and England midfielder Gallagher scored their first goals for Atletico Madrid in the team's 3-0 win over last-place Valencia. A\u0301lvarez sealed the home victory in stoppage time after Gallagher had opened the scoring in the 39th and Griezmann had doubled the lead in the 54th. \u201cI didn't feel like I was under pressure to score,\u201d A\u0301lvarez said. \u201cI was ready for when the opportunity appeared.\u201d It was the second consecutive win for Atletico, and third in five league matches. Diego Simeone's team drew its other two games. Valencia has opened its season with four losses and a draw \u2014 1-1 against Villarreal in the previous round. Earlier Sunday, 10-man Athletic Bilbao won 3-2 at Las Palmas, which hasn't won in 19 straight league games going back to last season. It was the second win for Athletic this season. Celta Vigo beat Valladolid 3-1 at home for its first win after two consecutive losses. It was the fourth straight game without a win for Valladolid after it opened with a victory at Espanyol. It lost three of its next four games. Published - September 16, 2024 11:56 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit soccer",

Vande Metro is unlike any other traditional metros in other parts of the country, including Delhi and Mumbai, and is designed for inter-city connectivity, attempting to bridge urban places with surrounding areas. The Railway Ministry emphasised that although the term 'metro' typically refers to an urban transport system, the Vande Metro has been designed with state-of-the-art technology and advanced features to serve a wider range of travel needs. The Vande Metro marks a major advancement in India\u2019s rail transport infrastructure, combining modern amenities with a functional design to elevate the passenger experience.

            "content": "The suspect, Routh was apprehended following a \"be on the lookout\" alert issued by the FBI, Secret Service, and Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Trump Assassination Attempt: This was the second apparent assassination attempt on US former President Donald Trump within two months, the first one at the election rally in Pennsylvania and the second in Florida Golf Club on Sunday afternoon. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was on a golf course when the U.S. Secret Service detected an unusual presence nearby. The FBI has described the incident as an \"attempted assassination.\" 10 Key Things To Know About Trump\u2019s Assassination Attempt The law enforcement officials have arrested a 58-year-old suspect identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. He was allegedly seen behind the bushes, merely 400 to 500 yards away from Trump. When the Secret Service official shot in the direction, he dropped the weapon a high-powered AK-47 style rifle and fled the scene. Routh entered a black-coloured SUV and drove off only to be arrested later in a neighbouring county. According to the police, the suspect had two black bagpacks hanging on the fence and a GoPro camera. Martin County Sheriff William Snyder reported that the man, after being apprehended, remained remarkably \u2018calm\u2019 and showed minimal emotion. \u201cHe never inquired, \u2018What is this about?\u2019 Despite the presence of law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, and considerable activity, he did not question the situation,\u201d Snyder stated. In 2002, Routh was found guilty of having a weapon of mass destruction, according to online records from the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction. The records don't explain the case further, but a 2002 News & Record article mentions a man with the same name who was arrested after a three-hour standoff with police. Undeterred by the two consecutive near miss, Donald Trump said, \u201cThere were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL\u201d. \u201cNothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER,\" he informed his supporters via email and then returned to his residence at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach. Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the incident. The White House stated they were \u201crelieved\u201d to learn that Trump is safe. Harris, who is running against Trump in the presidential polls, commented in a statement that \"violence has no place in America.\" The suspect was apprehended following a \"be on the lookout\" alert issued by the FBI, Secret Service, and Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Sheriff William Snyder reported that his deputies \u201cimmediately flooded\u201d northbound I-95, covering every exit from the Palm Beach County line to the south and the St. Lucie County line to the north. \u201cOne of my road patrol units saw the vehicle, matched the tag, and we set up on the vehicle,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cWe pinched in on the car, got it safely stopped, and took the driver into custody.\u201d On July 13, Donald Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, with a bullet grazing his ear. Eight days later, President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, clearing the path for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee. Since the assassination attempt in July, Donald Trump\u2019s security measures have been significantly increased. When he is at Trump Tower in New York, dump trucks are strategically parked to form a barrier outside the building. At outdoor rallies, he now addresses the crowd from behind bulletproof glass.

As a fellow musician, I have always wanted to connect with him and discuss how his mind works. I surprised him with my mother's homemade Pinni! This is how we have always welcomed anyone at our home.

            "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo will miss Al Nassr's AFC Champions League opener against Al Shorta. Al Nassr confirmed his absence, scroll down to know the reason. Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the world\u2019s most iconic footballers, will not be part of Al Nassr\u2019s opening match of the 2024-25 AFC Champions League against Iraqi side Al Shorta. The Portuguese star, who has been a key figure for the Saudi Arabian club, is set to miss the highly anticipated fixture due to a viral infection. This marks a significant setback for Al Nassr as they kickstart their campaign in the prestigious continental tournament. Ronaldo Ruled Out Due To Illness Al Nassr confirmed Ronaldo's absence on Sunday, September 15, through an official statement. The club revealed that their captain was diagnosed with a viral infection, preventing him from traveling with the team to Iraq. According to the team's medical advice, Ronaldo has been instructed to rest and recover at home. \"Al Nassr captain Cristiano Ronaldo was not feeling well today and was diagnosed with a viral infection. The team's doctor confirmed he needs to rest and stay at home. As a result, he will not be traveling with the team to Iraq today. We wish our captain a speedy recovery,\" the club announced via their social media channels. The absence of Ronaldo will surely be felt by Al Nassr, who have relied on the 38-year-old\u2019s experience and leadership since his high-profile move to Saudi Arabia. Despite this setback, Al Nassr will look to make a strong start to their AFC Champions League campaign under the guidance of coach Lui\u0301s Castro. Al Nassr\u2019s AFC Champions League 2024-25 Journey Al Nassr, alongside fellow Saudi clubs Al Hilal and Al Ahli, is part of the 2024-25 AFC Champions League Elite group stage. The competition has adopted a new format this season, similar to the Swiss system used in the UEFA Champions League, where each team plays eight matches \u2013 four at home and four away. Al Nassr\u2019s first challenge in the group stage will be an away fixture against Al Shorta on Monday, September 16. Following this, they will return to host Qatar\u2019s Al-Rayyan before traveling to Iran to face Esteghlal. Other key fixtures include a home clash with UAE\u2019s Al Ain, an away trip to Qatar to play Al Gharafa, and a final group match against Persepolis in Iran on February 17, 2025. This season\u2019s AFC Champions League is crucial for Al Nassr, with Ronaldo\u2019s presence expected to bolster their chances of making a deep run in the tournament. However, fans will have to wait a little longer for the Portuguese legend to make his debut in the 2024-25 competition, as he is expected to return to full fitness in the coming weeks. Road Ahead for Ronaldo and Al Nassr While Ronaldo\u2019s absence will be a blow for the team in their opening match, Al Nassr still boasts a formidable squad capable of competing at the highest level. The team will now turn to other stars such as Anderson Talisca and Sadio Mane\u0301 to lead the attack against Al Shorta. Ronaldo is expected to return to the pitch soon, with fans eager to see him in action as Al Nassr navigates the challenging group stage fixtures ahead. With the club aiming to make a significant impact on the continental stage, Ronaldo\u2019s eventual return will provide a much-needed boost as they chase AFC Champions League glory. For now, Al Nassr will be hoping to secure a positive result in Iraq and get their campaign off to a strong start, even without their talismanic captain.",

            "content": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, and probably a good friend of former US President Donald Trump, dropped an insensitive comment on the social media platform after the Republican candidate faced a second assassination attempt on Sunday. Trump was the target of what the FBI said \"appears to be an attempted assassination\" at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on September 15, just nine weeks after the Republican presidential nominee survived another attempt on his life. The former president said he was safe and well, and authorities held a man in custody. However, the business tycoon, Musk, on X, wondered, \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala\". The insensitive post came in response to a query from an X user with the handle @cb_doge, who asked why the former President was being targeted. CNN, Fox News and The New York Times identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. The FBI declined to comment and Reuters could not independently verify his identity. Reuters found profiles on X, Facebook, and LinkedIn for a Ryan Routh, and public access to the Facebook and X profiles was removed hours after the shooting. The three accounts bearing Routh's name suggest he was an avid supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia. On April 21, Routh directed an X message to Elon Musk, in which he wrote: \"I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putins Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please.\" The New York Times reported it had interviewed Routh in 2023 for an article about Americans who were volunteering to help the Ukraine war effort. Routh told the Times he'd traveled to Ukraine and spent several months there in 2022 and was trying to recruit Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. On X in 2020, Routh expressed support for Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and mocked Biden as \"sleepy Joe.\" Earlier this year, Routh tagged Biden in a post on X: \"@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.\" The suspected gunman's son, Adam, reached by Reuters at the hardware store where he works in Hawaii, said he had not yet heard of the newest Trump assassination attempt and had \"no information,\" adding it was not something he believed his father would do. Later, the reporter called back to the store and a colleague said Adam had gone home because of an emergency. Another son of Routh's, Oran, told CNN in a statement that \"I don't have any comment beyond a character profile of him as a loving and caring father ... I don't know what's happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion.\" (With inputs from agencies)",

            "content": "Kolkata Doctor Rape-Murder Case: The initial suspicion arose from nine calls made between Ghosh and Mondal that morning, details of which were obtained from their mobile phone records. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is set to conduct a joint interrogation of Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of R.G. Kar Medical College & Hospital, and Abhijit Mondal, the ex-station house officer of Tala Police Station, to probe into their suspicious activities on the morning of August 9. This was the day when the remains of a junior doctor, who was a victim of a brutal rape and murder, were found on the hospital grounds. The primary cause for suspicion arises from nine phone calls exchanged between Ghosh and Mondal that morning, details of which have been retrieved from their mobile phone call records. The CBI counsel informed a special court in Kolkata about these calls on Sunday. Investigators believe that by questioning Ghosh and Mondal together, they can uncover the nature of the information shared during these calls. Another concern is why Mondal's team, the first responders to the crime scene, and Ghosh permitted numerous individuals to leave the area, potentially compromising the integrity of the evidence. Both were arrested by the CBI on Saturday night for allegedly obstructing the initial investigation and tampering with evidence. Additionally, questions have been raised as to why Ghosh did not file an initial rape complaint and why Mondal did not enforce this procedure, despite clear signs of the heinous crime on the victim's body. Following their arrest, a special court granted the CBI a three-day custody of both individuals on Sunday. A pivotal Supreme Court hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, where the CBI is expected to present its second progress report on the case. Prominent Supreme Court advocate and activist Indira Jaising is set to participate in the proceedings.",

            "content": "Elon Musk Asks 'Why No Assassination Attempts On Biden, Harris' After Trump Suvives Another Attack. Reacting to the alleged assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump, tech billionaire Elon Musk made a controversial statement questioning why \"no assassination attempts were being made on US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\" On Sunday, Trump faced his second assassination attempt when gunshots were fired outside a golf course in Florida where he was playing. The FBI confirmed it was an attempted assassination, but both Trump\u2019s campaign and law enforcement reported that he was safe and unharmed. In response to an X user\u2019s question about why people might want to kill Trump, Musk tweeted: \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.\" As a Trump supporter, Musk often posts in his favor. The Secret Service confirmed that its agents \"opened fire on a gunman\" near the golf course and recovered an \"AK-47 style rifle\" along with a video camera. Authorities still haven\u2019t confirmed whether the gunman, identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, fired at Trump, but Secret Service agents did shoot at Routh, who was hiding in the bushes at the golf course. Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., mentioned that authorities also found an AK-47 rifle in the bushes, extremely close to where Trump was leaving. \"Again folks! SHOTS FIRED at Trump Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. An AK-47 was discovered in the bushes, per local law enforcement,\" Trump Jr. posted on X. This assassination attempt comes just two months after Trump was shot at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where he sustained a minor injury to his right ear. The attacker was immediately shot dead by security personnel. The White House issued a statement saying both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had been briefed about the incident. \"There is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement.",

            "content": "Tens of millions of people in Shanghai and across China's densely populated east coast hunkered indoors Monday (September 16, 2024) as the strongest storm to hit since 1949 swept in, downing trees and disrupting transport across the region. Typhoon Bebinca landed early Monday morning in the city's eastern coastal area, with wind speeds of up to 151 kilometres per hour (94 miles per hour), state media said. It is the strongest storm to hit Shanghai since Typhoon Gloria in 1949, state broadcaster CCTV said shortly after Bebinca made landfall. Many businesses were already closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival public holiday, and the city's 25 million residents have been advised to avoid leaving their homes. Shanghai's flood control headquarters told CCTV they had already received dozens of reports of incidents related to the typhoon \u2014 mostly fallen trees and billboards. An uprooted tree completely blocked one road in the city centre, an AFP reporter saw. Ferocious winds Xiong Zhuowu, a doctor and resident of the northern Baoshan district, posted a video of a real estate agent's sign being ripped away onto a roof in his compound. \"I feel quite nervous today, I'm constantly checking what the situation is out the window,\" Xiong told AFP . \"The property management found some trees with loose roots downstairs and immediately called me to move my car to prevent the tree hitting it if it fell.\" A government livefeed from Baoshan showed ferocious winds ripping through a line of trees on the riverbank. Despite the violent downpours and sudden gusts of wind, some were still braving the weather to go about errands. Resident Wu Yun said she had ventured outside because she had to sort something out at her sales job. \"I think it's okay, because I also saw a lot of typhoons in the south, so I think Shanghai is okay (compared to them),\" she told AFP as she struggled to open her umbrella against the wind. Branches and fallen bikes littered the road in the city's former French Concession, as delivery workers and clean-up crews persevered against the driving rain. A view from the Bund shows rising river levels after Typhoon Bebinca made landfall in Shanghai, China September 16, 2024.| Photo Credit:Reuters Flights grounded All flights at Shanghai's two main airports are grounded, and ferry services and some trains have been suspended. Highways were closed at 1 a.m. local time, and a 40-kilometre (25-mile) per-hour speed limit is in place on roads inside the city. At rush hour, live video feeds showed Shanghai's normally jammed roads almost empty of traffic, and its famed skyline obscured by thick fog. Nine thousand residents have been evacuated from Chongming District, an island at the mouth of the Yangtze River, authorities said. CCTV broadcast footage of a reporter by the coast in neighbouring Zhejiang province, where waves pounded the craggy coastline under leaden skies. \"If I step out into [the storm], I can barely speak,\" the reporter said. \"You can see that the surface of the sea is just wave after wave, each higher than the last.\" Another typhoon, Yagi, killed at least four people and injured 95 when it passed through China's southern Hainan island this month, according to national weather authorities. Bebinca has also passed through Japan and the central and southern Philippines, where falling trees killed six people. CCTV said Bebinca was expected to move northwest, causing heavy rain and high winds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are driving climate change and making extreme weather more frequent and intense.

            "content": "A day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's resignation announcement, Delhi Minister and AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday said despite whatever the Bharatiya Janata Party has done in 2 years, the chief minister still has faith in his people and his honesty. He went on to add that It has never happened in history that a sitting Chief Minister, after coming out of jail, is himself announcing that if you consider him honest, then vote for him. \"This will be the first election in the country, in which a Chief Minister is saying that this election will be fought in the name of honesty and that too, when the central government of the country, along with all the agencies, be it ED, CBI, Income Tax, all the agencies, are after the Chief Minister and no effort has been left to defame him,\" he said. Addressing a press conference, Bhardwaj said that the people of Delhi are so eager that the elections should be held and they will vote and make Arvind Kejriwal the Chief Minister again. On Sunday, Saurabh Bharadwaj addressed a press conference and said Kejriwal might be the only CM in the world to have resigned while asking people to vote for him only if he is honest. \"In the whole world, he might be the only CM who has asked people to vote for him only if he is honest, otherwise not to vote for him, that too after resigning from his post. That person is taking such a big risk to his whole career,\" he said. AAP leader Atishi called Sunday a 'historic day' in India's politics and said in this country's political history, the netas of political parties are seen with suspicion always, that they might have done corruption. But there is not one neta in the country's history who has asked for votes by telling people to only vote for him if he is honest, otherwise not to vote for him. To understand the announcement of CM Arvind Kejriwal, we need to understand Arvind Kejriwal the person.",

Ambedkar Telangana State Secretariat on Monday (September 16, 2024) late afternoon. All the Ministers and senior party functionaries will participate in the programme. While the unveiling was planned to be held on the 80th birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi, on August 20, 2024, it was postponed. All India Congress Committee (AICC) president Mallikarjun Kharge was invited for the event. A month ago, Opposition Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) raised objection to the statue stating that the space opposite to the Secretariat was designated for Telangana Talli Statue. Mr. Reddy on August 20 announced that Telangana Talli statue would be installed at the Secretariat. Bhoomi Puja for the statue was held on August 28, 2024.

The local MeT office predicted respite from the incessant rainfall, which has been lashing Jharkhand for the past two days, during the next 48 hours. \u201cDue to the downpour, mainly in Garhwa and Latehar districts, several culverts and diversions were washed away on Sunday (September 15, 2024). Besides, the rainfall coupled with strong wind also damaged standing paddy crops in many areas,\u201d farmers said. Meral in Garhwa district received the State's highest rainfall of 152.8 mm on Sunday (September 15, 2024), while Ranchi's Budmu area registered 112.2 mm rainfall and Daltonganj recorded over 110mm rainfall. \"Orange alert of heavy to very heavy rainfall has been issued for the northwest parts comprising districts of Garhwa, Palamu, Chatra, Latehar and others for today,\" said Abhishek Anand, in-charge of Ranchi Meteorological Centre. He urged the people, particularly those living in low-lying areas, of the northwest areas to be alert. Mr. Anand said the system was gradually moving towards the west and it is expected to cross Jharkhand in the next 24 hours. \"Widespread rainfall expected on Monday (September 16, 2024). There will be a sharp decline in rainfall on Tuesday (September 17, 2024). Light to moderate rainfall is expected in parts of Jharkhand on Tuesday,\" he said.

            "content": "Shootouts between hundreds of tribal warriors have left at least 30 people dead in Papua New Guinea's highlands, police said on Monday (September 16, 2024) as security forces were given emergency powers to quell the violence. Police said the unrest started in August when \"illegal miners\" inflicted life-threatening injuries on a landowner in the Porgera Valley, home to one of Papua New Guinea's largest gold deposits. Peace talks failed, and the situation spiralled into intense tribal fighting that saw 300 shots fired on Sunday (September 15, 2024) alone, according to police commander Joseph Tondop. Police said 30 men had been killed across the rival clans and hundreds of women and children displaced, with \"many\" homes burned to the ground. Two officials were also killed while waiting for a lift home after work, said Mr. Tondop. Police Commissioner David Manning said \"lethal force\" would be used to restore order in the hard-to-reach highlands region. \"Put simply, this means if you raise a weapon in a public place or to threaten another person, you will be shot,\" Mr. Manning said in a statement at the weekend. \"This deteriorating situation has been caused by illegal miners and illegal settlers who are victimising traditional landowners and using violence to terrorise local communities.\" Police said illegal miners from the Sakar clan had been squatting on land owned by their Piande rivals. Alcohol sales have been banned and an overnight curfew is in place, added Manning, who vowed to remove the artisanal miners from the valley. Tribal conflicts are a frequent occurrence in Papua New Guinea's highlands, but an influx of automatic weapons has made clashes deadlier. The latest burst of fighting had been turbocharged by the presence of more than \"100 high-powered weapons in the wrong hands\", police said. Security teams have been posted along the highway leading to the mine, using loudhailers to broadcast messages of peace. 'Stop the spiral' The Porgera gold mine once accounted for around 10% of Papua New Guinea's yearly export earnings. But recurrent flare-ups of tribal violence and a drawn out government takeover have slowed production in recent years. Gunfights between rival clans living near the mine killed at least 17 in 2022. And at least 26 people were killed, including 16 children, when three villages in East Sepik province were attacked earlier this year. Pope Francis urged Papua New Guinea to \"stop the spiral\" of violence during a visit earlier this month. \"It is my particular hope that tribal violence will come to an end,\" he said. \"It causes many victims, prevents people from living in peace and hinders development.\" Published - September 16, 2024 11:22 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Over 2,000 people buried in Papua New Guinea landslide Papua New Guinea's prime minister visits the site of a landslide estimated to have killed hundreds World / armed conflict / mining",

The doctors continued their sit-in outside Swasthya Bhawan, the headquarters of the Health department, for the eight day and the cease work for the 36th day and vowed to continue it till their demands - the removal of Kolkata Police Commissioner and senior state health officials are met. \"We will continue our cease work till our demands are met. The State government is not serious about resolving the crisis,\" an agitating junior medic said. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on Saturday made a surprise visit to the site where the doctors were protesting and assured them that their demands would be addressed, but the proposed meeting fell through, with the protesters claiming that they were asked to leave \"unceremoniously\" after waiting for three hours at the gates of the CM's residence. Another protesting doctor claimed they had agreed to attend the meeting without live-streaming or video recording as Ms. Banerjee requested, but after notifying Minister of State for Health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, of this decision, they were told to leave because it was too late. A few previous attempts at talks between the junior doctors and Banerjee had also failed due to disagreements over live streaming of the meetings and the number of attending representatives..

            "content": "Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's sudden announcement has sparked widespread speculation about potential successors, including his wife Sunita, and ministers Atishi and Gopal Rai. AAP's senior leader Manish Sisodia is scheduled to meet with Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday. This meeting comes in the wake of Kejriwal's declaration that he will not occupy the chief minister's seat until he receives a \"certificate of honesty\" from the public. Kejriwal has stated that he will only assume the role of chief minister, with Sisodia as his deputy, when the public deems them to be honest. On Monday, a party official stated, \"Today's meeting between Kejriwal and Sisodia will be their first since the announcement. It's expected that they will discuss the succession for the chief minister's post.\" The meeting is set to take place at the chief minister's official residence in Civil Lines. Following his release from Tihar Jail on bail related to the excise policy graft case last Friday, Kejriwal announced plans to convene a meeting with AAP MLAs soon. He indicated that a fellow party member would succeed him as chief minister. This sudden announcement has sparked widespread speculation about potential successors, including his wife Sunita, and ministers Atishi and Gopal Rai.",

            "content": "Pitru Paksha is observed over a period of sixteen days when auspicious rituals such as Pind Daan, Shradh and Pitru Tarpan are performed. Pitru Paksha, also known as Shradh or Mahalaya Paksha, is a significant period in Hinduism dedicated to honoring and paying respects to one's ancestors or Pitrus. The roots of Pitru Paksha can be traced back to ancient Hindu scriptures, including the Garuda Purana and the Mahabharata. According to Hindu mythology, it is believed that during this time, the gateway to the afterlife is opened, allowing departed souls to temporarily return to the earthly realm. This is an extremely auspicious time of the year when the deceased people of the family are remembered. Pitru Paksha is observed over a period of sixteen days when auspicious rituals such as Pind Daan, Shradh and Pitru Tarpan are performed. Shradh Date 2024 According to Drik Panchang, this year, Pitru Paksha will start with Bhadrapada, Shukla Purnima on September 17, and will go on till October 2, Ashwina, Krishna Amavasya. Auspicious Time For Shradh Karma 2024 According to Drik Panchang, the auspicious time for shradh karma will be, Kutup Muhurta: 11:50 am to 12:39 pm Rohin Muhurta: 12:39 pm to 01:28 pm Pitru Paksha Significance Pitru Paksha holds immense significance in Hindu culture for several reasons: Ancestral Reverence: It is a time when Hindus express their gratitude and respect to their forefathers, acknowledging their role in shaping the family's lineage and seeking their blessings for prosperity and well-being. Karmic Cleansing: Hindus believe that performing Shradh rituals during Pitru Paksha can help alleviate the ancestral souls' suffering and cleanse any negative karmas that may be affecting the family's fortunes. Fulfillment of Duties: Observing Pitru Paksha rituals is considered a moral and religious duty (dharma) in Hinduism. It is believed that neglecting these rites can lead to discontent among the ancestors, which may, in turn, bring misfortunes to the living. Rituals of Shradh 2024 The Shradh rituals during Pitru Paksha are performed with great devotion and care. Here are some of the essential practices associated with this period: Pinda Daan : Pinda, or rice balls, are prepared and offered to the deceased ancestors. The number and size of pindas vary depending on the deceased's age and gender. Food Offerings : Elaborate meals are prepared and offered to the ancestors. This includes dishes like kheer, puri, vegetables, and sweets. The food is placed on a banana leaf or a plate and then offered to the Pitrus. Tithi Shraddha : On the specific day of the deceased ancestor's death anniversary (tithi), a more elaborate Shradh ceremony is performed with additional rituals and offerings. Donations : It is customary to give alms to the needy and make charitable donations during Pitru Paksha as a way of earning merit for the ancestors' souls. Feeding Brahmins: Offering meals to Brahmins and seeking their blessings is another common practice during this period. (This article is intended for your general information only.

            "content": "Backed by the two in-form stars in World Championship challenger D. Gukesh and Arjun Erigaise, the Indian men scored a 3-1 victory over Azerbaijan in the fifth round of the 45th Chess Olympiad here. It seems like Gukesh and Arjun can do nothing wrong in this Olympiad as they overpowered Aydin Sulemanli and Rauf Mamedov respectively with their white pieces in quick time. Praggnanandhaa played another draw on board two to only ensure an Indian victory while Vidit Gujrathi played out a draw with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in a marathon game to complete the triumph. After scoring the fifth victory on the trot, the Indian men maintained a clean slate on ten points and they were joined by Vietnam who continued with their impressive show and downed Poland 2.5-1.5. The other two teams that joined the leaders\u2019 pack were China and Hungary who scored identical 2.5-1.5 victories over Spain and Ukraine respectively. With six rounds still to come in the biggest chess event, Magnus Carlsen\u2019s Norway and Iran are the only two teams sharing the fifth spot on 9 points apiece. Norway defeated a talented Turkey team by a 3-1 margin while Iran made most of the opportunities to down Canada 3.5-0.5. In the women\u2019s section, Grandmaster D. Harika suffered a shock defeat to give Kazakhstan an early lead. Better for most of the game, Harika misplayed after many pundits believed her position to be winning against Bibisara Assaubayeva. On the fourth board Vantika Agarwal yet again played the anchor and won a clean game with white pieces against Alua Nurman while Xeniya Balabayeva split the point with Divya Deshmukh. With the scores tied at 2-2 it was Vaishali\u2019s turn to come up triumphs for the team and she outwitted Meruert Kamalidenova. Team India joined Armenia and Mongolia in the lead on ten points. Armenia halted the Chinese party for now handing them a 2.5-1.5 defeat while Mongolia proved superior to United States with a similar score. The three leaders have 10 points apiece and they are now followed by Georgia and Poland a half point behind. Gukesh scored his fourth victory in a row at the expense of Sulemanli. The World championship challenger got a huge middle game advantage with scattered black pieces and a weak king and made no mistakes in converting that in to a full point. Arjun is the only Indian who has played all five games thus far and the primary reason is his ability to complicate matters with either colour. Up against Mamedov, it was Sicilian Dragon structure wherein Arjun converted to a complicated endgame and then his precise calculation helped him carve out his fifth win as many games. For the records, Arjun is currently at 2888 ELO rating points in live ratings and just 12 short of attaining the magical 2800 mark \u2013 a summit captured by only Viswanathan Anand as an Indian. The women section has seen some serious bouts wherein the tables were turned in quick time. In the next round now, the eves will take on Armenia. Results round 5 open: India (10) beat Azerbaijan (8) 3-1 (D Gukesh beat Aydin Sulemanli; R Praggnanandhaa drew with Nijat Abasov; Arjun Erigaise beat Rauf Mamedov; Shakhriyar Mamedyarov drew with Vidit Gujrathi); Ukraine (8) lost to Hungary (10) 1.5-2.5; Vietnam (10) beat Poland (8) 2.5-1.5; Spain (8) lost to China (10) 1.5-2.5; Turkey (7) lost to Norway (9) 1-3; Iran (9) beat Canada (7) 3.5-0.5. Women: Kazakhstan (8) lost to India (10) 1.5-2.5 (Bibisara Asaubayeva beat D Harika; R Vaishali beat Meruert Kamalidenova; Xeniya Balabayeva drew with Divya Deshmukh; Vantika Agrawal beat Alua Nurman); China (8) lost to Armenia (10) 1.5-2.5; Mongolia (10) beat USA (8) 2.5-1.5; Uzbekistan (7) lost to Georgia (9)1.5-2.5; Poland (9) beat Turkey (7) 3-1.

            "content": "The attacks by the wolves continue unabated in Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich district even as the Forest Department has launched a search operation to capture the man-eating animals. In yet another such incident in the district's Tipri Mohan village, a 10-year-old boy was injured when a wolf attacked him in the early hours of Monday. The attack occurred at around 2:30 am while the boy was asleep on the rooftop of his house. The victim has been identified as Imran. ' As per the information, the animal reportedly attempted to drag Imran by his neck, leaving deep wounds on his throat. The child was rushed to the district hospital in Bahraich for urgent medical treatment. According to the villagers, footprints matching those of a wolf were found inside the house, adding to the belief that the predator responsible for the attack was indeed a wolf. Eyewitnesses and local residents described how the wolf climbed up the staircase from the fields, crossed over one rooftop, and then attacked the sleeping child on a charpoy (traditional Indian bed) on a neighbouring roof. The village is now on high alert, with many fearing for their safety after the recent spate of wildlife attacks. This is not the first such incident in Bahraich. The district has seen a series of wolf-related attacks in recent months, leading to heightened concern among the local population. Authorities have been alerted, and forest officials are expected to increase patrols and take necessary steps to track down the animal. Around 50 villages in the Bahraich district are under threat from a pack of man-eating wolves. In a recent development, the Forest Department team captured the fifth wolf of the pack on September 10. The fifth wolf was captured as part of the 'Operation Bhediya' campaign that has been ongoing in Bahraich's Mahasi tehsil to catch a pack of six wolves that have killed eight people and injured more than 20 since mid-July, officials said. This wolf was the fifth member of a pack of six wolves that have been terrorising the 50 villages of Mahsi Tehsil for the past one and a half months. The team is now on the hunt for a wolf named 'Alpha.' The Divisional Forest Officer Ajit Pratap Singh said that \"Operation Bhedia\" is underway in the district and wolves are changing their location which makes it difficult to capture them. In the Mahsi tehsil of the district, wolf attacks on humans have been happening since March, Singh said. The attacks increased from July 17 during the rainy season and seven people, including six children, died in the attacks and about 30 people were injured, he added.",

            "content": "Britain failed to qualify for the last eight of the Davis Cup Finals after losing to Canada 2-1 in its last group-stage tie on Sunday (September 15, 2024), while Novak Djokovic helped Serbia secure a place in next year's qualifiers. The British needed a 3-0 win against the Canadians in Manchester, but Dan Evans lost 6-0, 7-5 to Denis Shapovalov to end Britain's hopes in the opening match in front of a crowd of 15,700 at the AO Arena, the biggest for a Davis Cup tie on British soil, according to organizers. Felix Auger-Aliassime then defeated Jack Draper 7-6 (8), 7-5 to seal Canada's victory and first place in Group D. England won the final doubles match. Evans hinted this may have been his last Davis Cup appearance. \u201cI've probably had my fair share now. It could be and probably will be (the end),\u201d he said. \u201cI need to have a think. If I don't feel capable of playing, I won't come back.\u201d Canada and Argentina advanced from Group D. Finland was the other team eliminated. Four groups have been playing in four cities to qualify for the eight-team Finals in Malaga, Spain, in November. The top two in each four-team group advance. In Valencia, Spain defeated Australia 2-1 to win Group B with both having already qualified. France and the Czech Republic were eliminated. In Bologna, the Netherlands won the closing doubles match to clinch its spot in the Finals despite a 2-1 loss to Italy in Group A. The Dutch needed a single win to advance but had lost the first two matches. The decisive win came with Wesley Koolhof and Botic van de Zandschulp defeating Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori 7-6 (6), 7-5. Brazil would have advanced had the Netherlands lost 3-0 to group-winner Italy. Belgium had already been eliminated. In Group C, Chile beat Slovakia in a match in Zhuhai, China between already eliminated nations. The United States and Germany had advanced from the group. Djokovic led Serbia to a 3-1 win over Greece in a World Group 1 tie in Belgrade. The Olympic champion partnered Hamad Medjedovic to a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 win over Aristotelis Thanos and Petros Tsitsipas. Djokovic beat Ioannis Xilas 6-0, 6-1 in the singles on Saturday (September 14, 2024). Former world No. 4 and two-time Davis Cup champion Tomas Berdych will take over the captaincy from Jaroslav Navratil for the Czech Republic. Navratil captained the Czechs for nearly two decades, including when it won the 2012 and 2013 titles with Berdych as a player.

The AAP national convener said that he would become Chief Minister and Manish Sisodia his deputy \"only when people say we are honest\". A party functionary on Monday said, \"Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Sisodia will be meeting today. This will be the first meeting after the decision by them. The meeting is also likely to see a discussion over the next Chief Minister.\" The meeting is slated to be held at the Chief Minister's official residence in the Civil Lines area. Mr. Kejriwal, who was released on bail from the Tihar Jail in the excise policy graft case on Friday, has said that he would hold a meeting of the AAP MLAs in a couple of days and one of his party colleagues would take over as the chief minister. His unexpected announcement kicked up a strong buzz over the names of his wife Sunita and his ministers Atishi and Gopal Rai as his possible replacement.

This initiative represents a significant leap towards low emission steel production. In the first phase, Jindal Renewables will develop a green hydrogen generation capacity of up to 4,500 tons per annum set to commence by December 2025. In addition, the project will also entail supply of 36,000 tons of oxygen per annum that will be used in the Angul steelworks. JRPL will also be supplying ~3GW of renewable energy to JSPL's facilities reducing the steelmaker's dependence on coal fired energy by 50% in the next 2-3years. This integration of green energy is expected to drastically lower the company's carbon footprint.",

Police Commissioner Anupam Agrawal said that the CCTV camera footage shows men on a motorbike hurling the stones before fleeing from the spot. Efforts are on to trace them, he said. Earlier on September 15, Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharath Shetty issued a statement seeking a ban on Eid Milad procession at B. C.

A prominent person has challenged people from other communities to stop the procession scheduled on Monday morning (September 16). \u201cWe know the way to give a befitting reply, but Hindus are not the persons who will provoke violence,\u201d he said. Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) activists, including VHP Mangaluru Divisional Joint Secretary Sharan Pumpwell, organised a protest in B. C. Road, against what they called provocative social media posts while Eid Milad procession went on in the town on September 16 morning. Police presence has beefed up in B. C. Road area.

            "description": "Social media accounts bearing Ryan Routh's name suggest he was an avid supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia.",
            "content": "A gunman attempted to assassinate former U.S. president Donald Trump on Sunday (September 15, 2024) at Mr. Trump's golf course in Palm Beach, Florida, authorities said. Several news organisations identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. The FBI declined to comment. Here is what we know so far about the suspected gunman: Gun barrel in bushes The Secret Service said its agents were accompanying Mr. Trump on the golf course, when one who was securing holes ahead of the Republican presidential candidate spotted a gun barrel in some bushes near the property line. Multiple agents engaged the gunman and fired at least four rounds at him. The gunman then dropped his AK-47 style rifle, two backpacks, a Go Pro camera and other items and fled in a black Nissan car. Palm Beach County sheriff Ric Bradshaw said a witness managed to take a photo of the suspected gunman's car and license plate and gave it to authorities. Shortly after, sheriff's deputies in neighboring Martin County stopped the suspect on Interstate 95 and took him into custody. Posts on Ukraine, democracy Reuters found profiles on X, Facebook, and LinkedIn for a Ryan Routh, and public access to the Facebook and X profiles was removed hours after the shooting. The three accounts bearing Routh's name suggest he was an avid supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia. On April 21, Routh directed an X message to Elon Musk, in which he wrote: \"I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putins Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please.\" The New York Times reported it had interviewed Routh in 2023 for an article about Americans who were volunteering to help the Ukraine war effort. Routh told the Times he had travelled to Ukraine and spent several months there in 2022 and was trying to recruit Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. On X in 2020, Routh expressed support for Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and mocked Mr. Biden as \"sleepy Joe.\" Earlier this year, Routh tagged Mr. Biden in a post on X: \"@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA... make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.\" The suspected gunman's son, Adam, reached by Reuters at the hardware store where he works in Hawaii, said he had not yet heard of the newest Trump assassination attempt and had \"no information,\" adding it was not something he believed his father would do. Later, the reporter called back to the store and a colleague said Adam had gone home because of an emergency. Another son of Routh's, Oran, told CNN in a statement that \"I don't have any comment beyond a character profile of him as a loving and caring father... I don't know what's happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion.\" Published - September 16, 2024 10:33 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit USA",

Meanwhile, Japanese film veteran, Hiroyuki Sanada, made a historic mark as the first Japanese actor to win Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, while Anna Sawai became the first actress of Asian descent to capture the Best Actress trophy. Director Frederick E. O. Toye rounded out the night\u2019s wins, bagging the Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for the episode, \u201cCrimson Sky\u2019. Comedy took an unexpected turn with Hacks stepping into the spotlight. The HBO Max series, previously seen as a contender but not a frontrunner, pulled off a major upset. It managed to wrestle the Best Comedy Series award from the grasp of The Bear . Carl Clemons-Hopkins, Mark Indelicato, Rose Abdoo, Jean Smart, Hannah Einbinder, Paul W.

Downs, and Jen Statsky \u2014 were recognized for their sharp work on the episode \u201cBulletproof.\u201d The victory was a real David vs. Goliath moment, as The Bear had been expected to dominate. Despite this, The Bear still had a night to remember, clinching 11 Emmys including back-to-back wins for Jeremy Allen White and Ebon Moss-Bachrach, a first time win for Liza Colon-Zayas and the award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for Christopher Storer. This marks a record for the most Emmys won by a comedy series in a single year, surpassing its own previous record of 10 wins. Baby Reindeer concluded its run , sweeping the Limited/Anthology Series categories with four Emmys, including Best Limited Series. Richard Gadd and Jessica Gunning earned awards for their lead and supporting roles, respectively, while Gadd\u2019s writing was also recognised.

Frech became the fourth Polish woman to win a singles title this century joining Magda Linette, Agnieszka Radwanska and current world No.1 Iga Swiatek. Frech made her first WTA singles final last July in Prague but the Guadalajara Open was her maiden WTA 500 final and first on hard courts. Gadecki arrived in Mexico with just two career wins over top-100 players but she recorded four this week, including a second-round win over world No. 11 Danielle Collins. The 22-year-old Australian, who is ranked 152nd, narrowly failed to become the first qualifier to win a singles title at WTA 500 level since 2021, when Liudmila Samsonova won at Berlin. The tournament was played at the Complejo Panamericano de Tenis, in Guadalajara.

            "content": "During a practice session in Chennai ahead of the first Test against Bangladesh, Virat Kohli broke a part of the wall at Chepauk Stadium with a powerful shot. IND vs BAN: India's star batter Virat Kohli is known for his power-packed performances on the field, but his prowess with the bat caused an unusual incident during a practice session at Chennai's Chepauk Stadium on Sunday, September 15. While preparing for the upcoming Test series against Bangladesh, Kohli sent one of his shots crashing into the wall near the dressing room, creating a large, ball-shaped hole. The incident, captured and reported by broadcaster Jio Cinema, left a lasting mark quite literally as Kohli's powerful strike broke through part of the Chepauk Stadium\u2019s wall. The Indian team has been training hard in Chennai ahead of their two-match Test series against Bangladesh, which is set to begin in just a week. Bangladesh, riding high after their historic 2-0 series win against Pakistan, are preparing to face India with renewed confidence. The Bangladesh players were recently rewarded with BDT 3.20 crore from the interim government for their triumph, making them even more eager to maintain their momentum in the upcoming series. While Bangladesh has never won a Test series on Indian soil, they will be hoping to break that streak this time around. India, meanwhile, enters this series with a commanding position at the top of the World Test Championship points table. Their last Test encounter saw them defeat England 4-1 in a five-match series earlier in 2024, after recovering from a loss in the opening Test in Hyderabad. Under Rohit Sharma\u2019s leadership, India will be looking to continue their dominance, not only in this series but also ahead of the much-anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia later in the year. The India vs. Bangladesh series will be a crucial opportunity for both teams to set the tone for future contests. Bangladesh will aim to build on their success, while India looks to solidify their position as the dominant force in Test cricket. The Chepauk Stadium incident adds an extra layer of intrigue to what promises to be an exciting series, and fans are eager to see if Kohli\u2019s batting, which can break walls, will break Bangladesh's hopes as well.",

            "content": "Explore the vibrant tapestry of traditions and customs that define a joyous and spiritually significant Hindu festival Ganesh Chaturthi. Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi, is a revered Hindu festival that commemorates the birth of Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed God of wisdom and prosperity. Celebrated with immense zeal across India, this festival holds cultural, social, and religious significance. The festivities commence with the creation of elaborately crafted clay idols, followed by prayers, rituals, and grand processions. Each tradition and custom associated with Ganesh Chaturthi carries a unique symbolic meaning, fostering a sense of unity and devotion among communities. Ganesh Chaturthi Traditions and Customs 1. Idol Creation and Installation Artisans sculpt clay idols of Lord Ganesha, emphasizing creativity and craftsmanship. The installation of these idols in homes and pandals marks the commencement of the celebrations. 2. Prayers and Offerings Devotees perform special prayers, offering modakas (sweets), fruits, and flowers to Lord Ganesha, seeking his blessings for wisdom, prosperity, and the removal of obstacles. 3. Poojas and Aartis Elaborate ceremonies and aartis (rituals) are conducted, accompanied by the chanting of sacred hymns and mantras, creating an atmosphere of spirituality and devotion. 4. Modak: The Divine Sweet Modak, a sweet dumpling, holds special significance as Lord Ganesha's favorite food. Its preparation and distribution symbolize the indulgence of the deity. 5. Visarjan: Farewell to Ganesha On the final day, a grand procession accompanies the immersion (visarjan) of the idols into rivers or seas, bidding an emotional farewell to Lord Ganesha, with a promise of his return. Ganesh Chaturthi, a beloved festival, embraces diverse traditions and customs. From the artistic creation of idols to heartfelt prayers and elaborate ceremonies, each ritual carries deep symbolism. Devotees seek Lord Ganesha's blessings for a prosperous life, showcasing their love through the offering of modak, his favorite sweet. The festival culminates with a poignant visarjan, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life. Ganesh Chaturthi not only honors the birth of Lord Ganesha but also exemplifies the unity and devotion within the community as they come together to celebrate this joyous occasion.

            "content": "C. Sebastian Antony Selvan\u2019s house in Chromepet doubles as a free tuition centre. Here one can hear the periodic table recited in a musical fashion. Starting with \u201cHydrogen, Helium, Lithium...\u201d it joins a chorus that reads \u201cLong live John Newlands and his law of octaves.\u201d Names of scientists Johann Dobereiner, John Newlands and Dmitri Mendeleev who contributed to the making of the periodic table are also heard. To memorise the periodic table, professor Selvan composed a song in Tamil and English in 1989 that he adopts to make the topic interesting and fun. Professor Selvan, who is a Chemistry faculty with R. V. Government Arts College in Chengalpattu, uses this approach to teach the subject to his students in class and at home where he gives free coaching. \u201cThis creative approach helps students memorise the elements while appreciating the contributions of these scientific figures,\u201d says the professor. He is also well-known for organising pattimandrams (debates) on various topics in Chemistry. He once conducted a pattimandram on Hydrogen, where students discussed the properties and significance of the element. For other difficult topics in Chemistry like atoms and equilibrium, Selvan uses stories to explain concepts. \u201cMy goal is to help students understand the subject in a way that doesn\u2019t overwhelm them,\u201d he says.

            "content": "The rupee appreciated by 5 paise to 83.87 against the U.S. dollar in early trade on Monday supported by weakening of the American currency in the overseas market and significant foreign fund inflows. Forex traders said market participants are eagerly awaiting cues from the U.S. Fed policy on Wednesday, with a rate cut all but certain. However, the magnitude of the cut remains uncertain. Moreover, the rupee continues to hold steady within a well-defined range on active intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), they added. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.89, then inched further to touch 83.87, registering a rise of 5 paise from its previous close. On Friday, the local unit settled higher by 4 paise at 83.92 against the U.S. dollar. \"Despite a significant drop in the dollar index and crude oil prices remaining under control in recent sessions, alongside inflation figures staying below the Central Bank's 4% target for the second consecutive month, the rupee has held steady,\" CR Forex Advisors MD Amit Pabari said. Pabari further added that this stability is largely due to the RBI's persistent intervention on the buying side, reflected in the build-up of reserves, which have now reached an all-time high of around $690 billion. India's forex reserves jumped $5.248 billion to a new all-time high of $689.235 billion for the week ended September 6, the Reserve Bank of India said on Friday. The overall kitty had jumped by $2.299 billion to a record $683.987 billion for the previous reporting week. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was down 0.26% to 100.85 points. Brent crude, the international benchmark, gained 0.15% to #71.72 per barrel in futures trade. In the domestic equity market, the 30-share BSE Sensex advanced 128.95 points, or 0.16%, to 83,019.89 points, while the Nifty was up 46.00 points, or 0.18%, to 25,402.50 points. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital markets on Friday, as they purchased shares worth \u20b92,364.82 crore, according to exchange data.

            "description": "Affordability and accessibility are the two main factors driving the popularity of the Working Women\u2019s Hostel run by the Women\u2019s India Association at Greenways Road in Chennai",
            "content": "On Greenways Road, near the MRTS station, a clutter of name boards greets visitors to the office of Women\u2019s India Association, a 107-year-old organisation started by a group of eminent women including Annie Besant, Margaret Cousins and Dorothy Jinarajadasa. For nearly five decades, a working women\u2019s hostel run by the Association on the premises has been catering silently to the needs of hundreds of women who come to Chennai in search of employment (the campus also offers training for women in tailoring and computers). As a vacant place was available on the campus of WIA, the members of the executive committee availed financial assistance from the Central Government and State\u2019s Social Welfare Department for construction of the hostel building that started in 1974, says a note written in the souvenir released during the centenary year celebration of WIA. Later, members donated various utility items to make the hostel more user-friendly. Affordability and its prime location are two main factors driving the popularity of this hostel among young women. Students from Ambedkar Law College, those preparing for civil service examinations and working women in search of a new job were among those who patronised the hostel. An office staff who has been associated with WIA for 19 years says rent those days was low. Even today they charge only a nominal fee from residents. Currently, the WIA charges \u20b91,250 a month for a single room accommodation excluding the food and a refundable caution deposit. Unlike present-day hostels that offers a raft of sophisticated features, this one has a library it is proud of. A one-time library fee of \u20b950 is collected at the time of admission to encourage its residents to browse its small collection of books. Letika Saran, former director general of police, was once a resident of the hostel, says the note. A majority of the residents are admitted through reference. Currently, the hostel has more than 40 residents and manages to stay afloat amidst all the competition from private players in the city.

            "content": "Harry Brook is set to captain England for the first time in the one-day international series against Australia after Jos Buttler was ruled out because of his persistent calf injury. Buttler has not played a competitive match since England lost the T20 World Cup semifinal against India in Guyana at the end of June. Having missed the Hundred he suffered a setback in his recovery and has also been forced out of facing the Australians. Brook, 25, has only 15 caps in ODI cricket but England views him as a future leader and had already primed the Yorkshireman to deputize for Buttler when the squad was announced. The first of five one-day internationals between England and Australia starts Thursday (September 19, 2024) at Trent Bridge. Brook's appointment also means England has had a new captain in each international format this summer. Ollie Pope took the test reins from Ben Stokes when the latter\u2019s hamstring injury saw him miss the three-match series against Sri Lanka and Phil Salt inherited the T20 role from Buttler for that series.

            "description": "A year after the State Government established hostels for working women, The Hindu Downtown does a status check on these facilities",
            "content": "The Thozhi hostels run by Tamil Nadu Working Women\u2019s Hostels Corporation gets a thumbs-up for the sophisticated features it offers users; but it does not score significantly on the affordability count. Currently, three such facilities are being run in Chennai \u2014 one in Adyar and the others in Guduvancherry and Tambaram Sanatorium. For a stay numbering less than 15 days, the fare ranges from \u20b9600 to \u20b91,200 a day (price varies on the basis of the number of occupants) as per details mentioned on https://www.tnwwhcl.in. This fare does not include food and can be a burden for someone coming from the districts in search of employment in the city or for one working as a grey collar worker. Some months ago, author and activist Shalin Maria Lawrence put out a post on X noting that the rates are exorbitant \u201cconsidering the fact that the State Government gets subsidy from the Central Government for this scheme\u201d. The post also had a circular that gives the break-up in terms of the support from the two tiers of the government. Those running private hostels also feel the fee being charged is higher than the rate fixed by them. \u201cA majority of the private hostels charge \u20b9400 a day, so for a government set-up, this is high,\u201d says G. Jaganathan, member of South Chennai Hostel Owners Association. He says many women have to support their families back home, so they want an accommodation with food that can be within \u20b9 6,000. However, the staff managing these facilities say the services offered at these hostels are good, and price is not a concern for many women and students. Some of these hostels have as its patrons, students preparing for various government examinations. The Adyar facility currently has no room available for the next few weeks. A staff who attended the call says one has to make the online booking at least 15 days in advance. From free WiFi, space for parking two-wheelers to its strategic location, these hostels offer a host of amenities. A staff say they get close to 200 bookings a month (across its locations in Tamil Nadu) with Chennai accounting for a major chunk of them. A new hostel is coming up at St Thomas Mount and many more are in the proposal stage.

            "description": "An ongoing trial may determine whether Google holds an illegal monopoly on the technology used to buy and sell certain types of advertising on web pages",
            "content": "It happens in milliseconds, ideally, as you browse the web. Networks of computers and software analyse who you are, what you are looking at and buy and sell the advertisements you see on web pages. The company that most likely determines which ads you get, and how much an advertiser paid to get on your screen, is Google. In fact, the Justice Department and a coalition of states say Google's dominance over the technology that controls the sale of billions of Internet display ads every day is so thorough that it constitutes an illegal monopoly that should be broken up. A trial under way in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, will determine if Google's ad tech stack constitutes an illegal monopoly. The first week has included a deep dive into exactly how Google's products work together to conduct behind-the-scenes electronic auctions that place ads in front of consumers in the blink of an eye. Online advertising has rapidly evolved. Fifteen or so years ago, if you saw an internet display ad, there was a pretty good chance it featured people dancing over their enthusiasm for low mortgage rates, and those ads were foisted on you whether you were looking at real estate or searching for baseball scores. Now, the algorithms that match ads to your interests are carefully calibrated, sometimes to an almost creepy extent. Google, for its part, says it has invested billions of dollars to improve the quality of ads that consumers see, and ensure that advertisers can reach the consumers they're seeking. The Justice Department contends that what Google has also done over the years is rig the automated auctions of ad sales to favor itself over other would-be players in the industry, and also deprived the publishing industry of hundreds of millions of dollars it would have received if the auctions were truly competitive. Government witnesses have explained the auction process and how it has evolved over the years in detail at the Virginia trial. In the government\u2019s depiction, there are three distinct tools that interact to sell an ad and place it in front of a consumer. There\u2019s the ad servers used by publishers to sell space on their websites, particularly the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of a web page. Ad networks are used by advertisers to buy ad space across an array of relevant websites. And in between is the ad exchange, which matches the website publisher to the would-be advertiser by hosting an instant auction. Publishers naturally want to receive as high a price as possible for their ad space, but testimony at trial has shown that didn't always happen due to the rules Google imposed. For years, Google gave its ad exchange, called AdX, the first chance to match a publisher's proposed floor price. For instance, if a publisher wanted to sell a specific ad impression for a minimum of 50 cents, Google's software would give its own ad exchange the first chance to purchase. If Google's ad exchange bid 50 cents, it would win the auction, even if competing ad exchanges down the line were willing to pay more. Google said the system was necessary to ensure ads loaded quickly. If the computers entertained bids from every ad exchange, it would take too long. Publishers, dissatisfied with this system, found a workaround to conduct the auctions outside of Google's purview, a process that became known as \u201cheader bidding.\u201d Internal Google documents introduced at trial described header bidding as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Google's market share. Google's response relied on its control of all three components of the process. If publishers conducted an auction outside Google's purview but they still used Google's publisher ad server, called DoubleClick For Publishers, that software forced the winning bid back into Google's Ad Exchange. If Google was willing to match the price that publishers had received under the header-bidding auction, Google would win the auction. Professor Ramamoorthi Ravi, an expert at Carnegie Mellon University, said rules imposed by Google failed to maximise value for publishers and \u201cseem to have been designed to advantage Google's own products.\u201d Publishers could stop using Google's ad exchange entirely, but at trial said they were reluctant to do so because then they would also lose access to Google's huge, exclusive cache of advertisers in its Google Ads network, which was only available through Google's ad exchange. Google, for its part, says it hasn't run auctions this way since 2019, and that in the last five years Google's share of the display ad market has begun to erode. It says that tying its buy side, sell side and middleman products together helps them run seamlessly and quickly, and minimises fraudulent ads or malware risks. Google also says its innovations over the last 15 years fueled the improvements in matching online ads to consumer interests. Google says it was at the forefront of introducing \u201creal-time bidding,\u201d which allowed an advertiser selling shoes, for instance, to be paired up with a consumer whose online profile indicated an interest in purchasing shoes. Those innovations, according to Google, allowed publishers to sell their available ad space at a premium because the advertiser would know that the ad was going to the eyeballs of someone interested in their product or service. The Justice Department says that even though Google no longer runs its auctions in the ways described, it helped Google maintain its monopoly in the ad tech market in the years leading up to 2019, and that its existing monopoly allows Google to keep up to 36 cents on the dollar of every ad purchase it brokers when the transaction runs through all of its various products. The Virginia trial comes just a month after a judge in Washington ruling that Google's search engine also constitutes an illegal monopoly. No decision in that case has been made on what, if any, remedies the judge will impose.

            "content": "Maratha leader Manoj Jarange Patil is set to resume his hunger strike on Monday in Maharashtra's Jalna district. According to the information, Patil will sit on a hunger strike in Antarwali Sarati village. The strike is part of his ongoing demand for reservation for the Maratha community under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. Patil has been a vocal advocate for the inclusion of Marathas in the OBC category, pushing for the community to be granted the same benefits as other castes listed under the OBC framework. His demand stems from the broader movement within the Maratha community, which has been fighting for quotas in government jobs and educational institutions. Jarange Patil's earlier protests and hunger strikes had garnered significant support from the Maratha population, resulting in statewide discussions and demonstrations. The Maharashtra government had initiated talks to address the issue, but no resolution has been reached thus far. Though the government agreed to issue a 'Kunbi' (an OBC community) caste certificate to eligible Marathas, his demand that all Marathas be given reservation in the Other Backward Class (OBC) category has not been fulfilled. Earlier this year, assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar had directed the government to set up a Special Investigation Team to conduct a comprehensive inquiry after Jarange made some controversial remarks about Deputy Chief Minister . If the demands are not met, the Maratha community will field candidates in all 288 assembly seats in the state elections due later this year, and they will represent all the communities, Jarange Patil had told the media. Earlier in the month of May, Jarange Patil said the Maratha community will teach Maharashtra\u2019s Mahayuti government a lesson for denying reservations and registering criminal cases against protestors. The Maratha quota agitation intensified in September 2023 after police lathi-charged protesters at Antarwali Sarati, in Marathwada region\u2019s Jalna district, where Jarange had launched an indefinite hunger strike. It was followed by violent agitations in Beed and other areas of Marathwada in October, eventually forcing the government to hold talks with him.",

            "content": ", England's regular wicketkeeper batter and captain, is open to leaving the role behind the stumps with him not getting younger and if that helps his captaincy too. Buttler, who has been out of action since the T20 World Cup, owing to a right calf injury, will miss the ODI series against England after being ruled out of the Hundred and the T20 series and was in conversation with his predecessor and Nick Knight during the washed out Manchester T20I. Buttler, who has been retained as the white-ball captain despite England failing to defend both ODI and T20 World Cups in span of 12 months, said that if it helps in his captaincy, he would give up the gloves with Morgan giving example of Brendon McCullum, who fielded at mid-off during the latter part of his career. \"If I was playing in this T20 series, I was going to give up the gloves and commit to being at mid-off and seeing how that felt,\" Buttler said on Sky Sports during the third T20I between England and Australia on Sunday, September 15. \"Baz [McCullum] stumbled across it with injury preventing him from keeping wicket but then he really enjoyed being next to the bowler at mid-off so that's something we can talk about. If that's something that will really help me in my captaincy then it's something that I am definitely open to. \"I am very open to those kinds of things. I just want what's best for the team and what's best for the team is going to be me being the best captain I can be. If I have to move from behind the wickets to do that, then so be it,\" Buttler added. England named Harry Brook as the captain for the ODIs with Phil Salt or Jamie Smith likely to take the gloves. Buttler said that the team would make a call on the same in the coming days as they want to ensure role clarity for the younger players, especially like Smith, who has taken to the role easily in Test matches.",

According to the PMO, the Vande Bharat trains to be flagged off by PM Modi will operate on routes including Kolhapur-Pune, Pune-Hubballi, Nagpur-Secunderabad, Agra Cantt to Banaras, and Durg to Visakhapatnam. The first 20-coach Vande Bharat train will run between Varanasi and Delhi. According to Western Railway officials, the Ahmedabad-Bhuj Vande Metro service will stop at nine stations and cover the 360-kilometre distance in 5 hours and 45 minutes at a top speed of 110 kilometres per hour. It will depart from Bhuj at 5:05 am and reach Ahmedabad Junction at 10:50 am, according to the officials. The Ahmedabad-Bhuj Vande Metro is a fully unreserved air-conditioned train for which passengers can buy tickets from the counter shortly before its departure, Western Railway (Ahmedabad division) public relations officer Pradeep Sharma said on Saturday. The prime minister will also inaugurate a 30 MW solar system, a 35 MW BESS Solar PV Project at Kutch Lignite Thermal Power Station, Kutch, and 220 Kilovolt substations at Morbi and Rajkot. PM Modi will launch the Single Window IT System (SWITS) of the International Financial Services Centres Authority, designed to streamline financial services. The Prime Minister will sanction over 30,000 houses under the PMAY-Gramin and release the first instalment for these homes, as well as launch construction of houses under the PMAY scheme. At the Ahmedabad event, PM Modi will also lay the foundation stone of projects concerning the quadrupling of the Samakhiali\u2013Gandhidham and Gandhidham\u2013Adipur railway lines, the development of iconic roads and the construction of flyovers in Ahmedabad city.",

            "content": "Meta Platforms will begin training its AI models using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram in the UK over the coming months , the company said, after it had paused the training in the region following a regulatory backlash. The company will use public posts including photos, captions and comments to train its generative artificial intelligence models, it said on Friday, adding that the training content will not include private messages or information from accounts of users under the age of 18. The update follows Meta's decision in mid-June to pause the launch of its AI models in Europe after the Irish privacy regulator told the company to delay its plan to harness data from social media posts. The company had then said the delay would also allow it to address requests from Britain's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). \"Since we paused training our generative AI models in the UK to address regulatory feedback, we've engaged positively with the ICO ... this clarity and certainty will help us bring AI at Meta products to the UK much sooner,\" Meta said on Friday. Facebook and Instagram users in the UK will start receiving in-app notifications from next week explaining the company's procedure and how users can object to their data being used for the training, Meta added. Meta has made changes to its approach since it paused the plans in June, the ICO said in a statement, adding the company has simplified the way users can object to the processing of their data and has extended the window in which they can do so. In June, Meta's plans faced backlash from advocacy group NOYB, which urged national privacy watchdogs across Europe to stop such use of social media content, saying the notifications were insufficient to meet EU's stringent privacy and transparency rules.

            "description": "Aerospace engineer Karkenahalli Srinivas, also known as Sydney Srinivas, says there is demand for good science writing in Kannada, but those who enjoy writing such works in the regional language are dwindling",
            "content": "Aerospace engineer Karkenahalli Srinivas, also known as Sydney Srinivas, recently wrote a book on Nobel laureate Marie Curie, available in both English and Kannada, published by Prism Books. The book presents previously unreleased information about Curie, made public by her granddaughter in 1990, and blends Curie\u2019s personal and professional life. It delves into her contributions to science, particularly in radioactivity and nuclear physics, offering insights for both general readers and science students. Curie with her husband Pierre Curie| Photo Credit:Wikimedia Commons The book was recently published in July and will be launched in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, Marie Curie\u2019s birthplace, on September 18. It will be followed by another launch at the museum of Institut Curie, Paris, which the renowned physicist established. Professor Marie Curie working in the laboratory of Paris University in 1925.| Photo Credit:- In this interview with The Hindu , talking about his new book, Srinivas shares that his interest in writing about scientific personalities, including Srinivasa Ramanujan and Albert Einstein, began in 2012 after his retirement. He emphasises the importance of making scientific literature available in regional languages like Kannada, highlighting that there is a significant gap in such resources. He believes that writing about science requires a strong understanding of both science and literature and encourages young writers to develop a reading habit to succeed in this genre. Tell us a little about your new book Marie Curie. The book contains information on Marie Curie that was not available to the public until 1990 when Curie\u2019s granddaughter released it for public use. This information is still not easily accessible or available to all, because of which I wanted to put it in a book and make it accessible for all. The book is a life account on her and has many scientific aspects to it like what radioactivity is, how it was discovered and more. The book also talks about Curie\u2018s impact on science, nuclear physics and more. It is a nice blend of Curie\u2019s personal and professional life. There is much food for thought both for the public and a science students in this book. You have written books on other science and economic personalities like Srinivasa Ramanujan, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Galileo, Henry Ford, Alan Turing, Alfred Nobel and Charles Darwin. When and how did your interest in writing books on such personalities start? My interest in writing these kinds of books started close to my retirement in 2012. I worked at the School of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia, there a colleague asked me a question on Srinivasa Ramanujan and the cause of his death, I realised that I was totally ignorant of that. The same colleague gave me a book on Ramanujan called The Indian Clerk , I read the book and was ashamed that I did not know anything about this great man. I read the book, was fascinated by his work and went to Kumbakonam where Ramanujan was educated. After I returned many people in Sydney asked me to write a biography on him, and that is how my journey with books started. You have also translated most of your work to Kannada. Was it a challenge translating, what was your intention behind presenting your books in Kannada? It was never a challenge; I always had a flair for writing in Kannada. I started writing for local Kannada magazines and papers in 1959, only after I moved to Australia, I picked up a flair to write in English too. For me, it is like I write Kannada from my heart and English from my brain. Though I have not been able to write many Kannada books, I have managed to write short biographies of about 10,000 words, as I wanted Kannada readers to know about these personalities. What do you think about the need for science education in regional languages? I have lived in Sydney since the 1980s, and since then have been only a visitor to India, I am not completely aware of the education systems here. But I am aware that there is a lack of scientific literature in regional languages. There is a need for more books or scientific literature in Kannada and science education in Kannada. When I wrote about Mary Curie, many people here in India asked what or who she is, what she did and more. Most people have heard of Albert Einstein, but they are not aware of what he did exactly. Lack of information in regional languages and a lack in general sense of reading is the reason behind it. What must be done to have more literature on science in regional languages, and how does one develop a flair to write such books? I have been writing for local magazines and newspapers for decades, the editors from these magazines have many times told me that a lot of readers from the interiors of Karnataka enjoy my writings on science, and they request more such articles to be published. We have a good number of readers across Karnataka who enjoy reading pieces or information on science, but we need more writers who enjoy writing such work. Of course, if one is from a science background it gets easier, but to develop a flair to write science literature, one should understand both science and literature well. From a very young age, I was into reading any form of literature be it books, novels, poems, and more. Young writers should develop this habit to become a successful science author.

            "content": "There is a glaring absence of science books, textbooks and resources in Indian languages, with Kannada being no exception. Lack of encouragement for scientific writing in Kannada, language barrier in scientific terminology, and the prevailing educational system play a huge role in this, say Kannada science writers from across the State. \u201cWe do not have many original science writers in Kannada. It is not that people do not want to read science in the local language, but the market forces do not allow science to be published in the language. There are quite a few senior writers like Palahalli Vishwanath, Nagesh Hegde and Syndey Srinivas who have been writing on science in Kannada, but as someone who has been in the field of science for four decades, I have not come across too many young writers who are keen on writing science literature in Kannada,\u201d says Kollegala Sharma, a popular Kannada science writer and a senior science communicator. Pointing to a unique problem in Kannada, he says that there is confusion, in fact more a controversy, on whether to use Sanskrit or Kannada words for scientific terms or retain some of them as they exist in English. \u201cSo, there is also a lack of authors who write readable science text in Kannada,\u201d Sharma says. Another issue is the lack of science textbooks in Kannada, says Sharma. \u201cWhen it comes to textbooks, it is not correct to say that Kannada medium education is not there. Up to 10th standard, we have at least 50% of students passing in Kannada medium. But, for higher studies, that is after pre-university level, we do not have textbooks in Kannada. Even if there are Kannada science textbooks available for the school and college levels, they are mostly NCERT textbooks that are translated to Kannada, which is again not readable. If you look at the total population, about 80% of people do not have access to science information because of this,\u201d he adds. Similarly, Vishwa Keerthi, a Kannada science writer who has contributed to many newspapers and magazines, also feels that the higher education system, having English as a medium of instruction, plays a huge role in Kannada Science books not doing well. \u201cScience writers are not very keen on learning scientific terms in Kannada. For many of them, it is hard to write and explain concepts and theories in Kannada. This is because there is a lack of connection with Kannada literature. If you are someone who has grown up reading Kannada literature or has developed an interest in Kannada literature, it makes it much easier to write science literature,\u201d he adds. However, Keerthi says that readership for Kannada science literature does exist. \u201cWhen I started writing I had no idea how many people read my work. I would get calls from remote districts in the state, and teachers from those districts said that their students had read my work. To that extent writing science in Kannada is helping many, but it needs to reach a larger pool of readers,\u201d he explains.

The actor made a stylish appearance in a dapper brown shirt. Talking about the joyous festival, Ganesh Chaturthi is a 10-day festival that commenced on September 7 and will continue until Anantha Chaturdashi. This festival is also known as Vinayak Chaturthi or Vinayak Chavithi. During Ganesh Chaturthi, Lord Ganesha is worshipped as the god of new beginnings and the remover of obstacles. Devotees across India and abroad celebrated Lord Ganesha's wisdom and intelligence. Devotees welcomed Ganesh idols into their homes, offered prayers, and visited the colourful pandals. The streets were filled with the sounds of devotion and joy as people came together to celebrate the festival with enthusiasm and heart. The colourful decorations, lively chants, and the fragrance of sweets added to the festive spirit that could be felt everywhere.

            "content": "The Visakhapatnam district committee of CPI(M) organised a Maha Dharna at Gajuwaka Junction here on Sunday (September 15, 2024) demanding that the RINL-Visakhapatnam Steel Plant be saved from a deplorable financial situation and not be privatised under any circumstances. CPI(M) leaders K. Lokanadham, M. Jaggunaidu, B. Gangaram, P.S.N.V. Srinivasa Raju, and K.M. Srinivasa Rao were among those who led the protest, which started at 9 a.m. and ended at 1 p.m. Raising slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the State coalition government, the Left party leaders started the protest by paying floral tributes to the portrait of late CPI(M) national leader Sitaram Yechury. Mr. Lokanadham said that they would continue the protest until the governments come up with a proper solution and chart the future course of action in support of the steel plant and its thousands of workers and their families. In support of their protest, the leaders and activists of the Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee reached the spot and thanked them for protesting in favour of the steel plant. The committee continued their protest on Sunday, the 1312th day. On the occasion, J. Ayodhyaram, Convenor of the Porata Committee, said that the steel plant was established with the sacrifice of 32 people. It has served the country for the past 40 years without any hindrance. However, after the Narendra Modi government came to power, during its 2.0 government, announced disinvestment in the plant. Since then, the plant has fallen into trouble. The Central and State governments have conspired to close it permanently to pave the way for privatisation, he lamented. \u201cWe strongly demand governments not make any adverse decisions on the steel plant. We also asked the State government to fight with the Centre to save the steel plant. Otherwise, there will be massive protests across the State, and the situation will be serious,\u201d said Ayodhyaram.

            "description": "A billionaire spacewalker is back on Earth with his crew on Sunday, ending a five-day trip",
            "content": "A billionaire spacewalker returned to Earth with his crew on Sunday, ending a five-day trip that lifted them higher than anyone has travelled since NASA\u2019s moonwalkers. SpaceX\u2019s capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico near Florida's Dry Tortugas in the predawn darkness, carrying tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, two SpaceX engineers and a former Air Force Thunderbird pilot. They pulled off the first private spacewalk while orbiting nearly 460 miles (740 kilometers) above Earth, higher than the International Space Station and Hubble Space Telescope. Their spacecraft hit a peak altitude of 875 miles (1,408 kilometers) following Tuesday\u2019s liftoff. Isaacman became only the 264th person to perform a spacewalk since the former Soviet Union scored the first in 1965, and SpaceX\u2019s Sarah Gillis the 265th. Until now, all spacewalks were done by professional astronauts. \u201cWe are mission complete,\u201d Isaacman radioed as the capsule bobbed in the water, awaiting the recovery team. Within an hour, all four were out of their spacecraft, pumping their fists with joy as they emerged onto the ship's deck. It was the first time SpaceX aimed for a splashdown near the Dry Tortugas, a cluster of islands 70 miles (113 kilometers) west of Key West. To celebrate the new location, SpaceX employees brought a big, green turtle balloon to Mission Control at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. The company usually targets closer to the Florida coast, but two weeks of poor weather forecasts prompted SpaceX to look elsewhere. During Thursday's commercial spacewalk, the Dragon capsule\u2019s hatch was open barely a half-hour. Isaacman emerged only up to his waist to briefly test SpaceX\u2019s brand new spacesuit followed by Gillis, who was knee high as she flexed her arms and legs for several minutes. Gillis, a classically trained violinist, also held a performance in orbit earlier in the week. The spacewalk lasted less than two hours, considerably shorter than those at the International Space Station. Most of that time was needed to depressurise the entire capsule and then restore the cabin air. Even SpaceX's Anna Menon and Scott \u201cKidd\u201d Poteet, who remained strapped in, wore spacesuits. SpaceX considers the brief exercise a starting point to test spacesuit technology for future, longer missions to Mars. This was Isaacman\u2019s second chartered flight with SpaceX, with two more still ahead under his personally financed space exploration program named Polaris after the North Star. He paid an undisclosed sum for his first spaceflight in 2021, taking along contest winners and a pediatric cancer survivor while raising more than $250 million for St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. For the just completed so-called Polaris Dawn mission, the founder and CEO of the Shift4 credit card-processing company shared the cost with SpaceX. Isaacman won\u2019t divulge how much he spent.

            "content": "The Trump assassination attempt suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh was armed with an AK-47 and GoPro, had a troubling history and vocal online declarations against Trump. Former UP President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump narrowly escaped second assassination attempt on Sunday in Florida, according to the FBI. Gunshots were reported near Trump\u2019s vicinity when he was on course at his Golf Club. Following the incident the US Secret Services have arrested a 58-year-old suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh and seized a high-powered AK-47 style rifle and a GoPro camera from the scene. When Secret Service agents started shooting, Routh apparently ran out from the bushes where he was hiding and got away in a black car. The police found the car with witnesses who pointed it out to them and arrested the suspect. According to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw\u2019s statement cited by AP, after an agent fired, the gunman dropped the rifle and fled in an SUV, abandoning the firearm along with two backpacks, a scope used for aiming, and a GoPro camera Who Is Ryan Wesley Routh Routh is a former construction worker from North Carolina Greesboro, reported the New York Times. Routh lacks any formal military experience, had previously expressed a strong interest in joining armed conflicts, particularly in Ukraine following Russia's 2022 invasion. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he stated his readiness to \"fight and die\" in Ukraine. Routh also urged civilians to be active in changing global conflicts. A screengrab of his earlier tweet over Donald Trump is doing round on \u2018X\u2019, in which he called the former president \u2018retarded. \u201c@realDonaldTrump While you were my choice in 2106, I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate, but we all were greatly disappointment and it seems you are getting worse and devolving; are you retarded; I will be glad when you gone,\u201d he posted in November 2020. \"I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE,\" Routh wrote. In his WhatsApp bio too, he has written similar texts, \"Each one of us must do our part daily in the smallest steps help support human rights, freedom and democracy; we each must help the Chinese,\" his bio reads. Apart from these social sites declarations, he gave an interview to The New York Times wherein he claimed to have travelled to Ukraine to recruit Afghan soldiers in a bid to support war efforts. As of his history with the police, Routh was arrested in 2002 for barricading himself inside a building with a fully automatic weapon in Greensboro. The charges were serious, but the case's outcome is still uncertain. Donald Trump Says, \u2018Safe and Well\u2019 The US Secret Service detained an individual after multiple gunshots were fired near former President Donald Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The incident occurred shortly before 2 p.m. on Sunday while Republican presidential candidate was on the course, according to the Secret Service. The White House confirmed that both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been briefed on the security incident involving former President Donald Trump while he was golfing earlier on Sunday. According to CNN, both leaders expressed relief that Trump is safe. The incident is notably concerning as around two months ago, former President Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania, where a bullet grazed his ear.",

            "content": "Yakshagana in the United States has been able to make its mark, but there is also a need to consolidate it, said overseas Yakshagana teacher Rajendra Kedlaya in Manipal on Saturday, September 14. In conversation with students and faculty of Gandhian Centre for Philosophical Arts and Sciences (GCPAS), MAHE, Mr. Kedlaya said that his experience of running a Yakshagana school in the United States has been exhilarating, and many children and youngsters are learning and performing it. Even though the dialogue delivery is in English, it appears quite natural and spontaneous, he said. Mr. Kedlaya, who started his career in Biochemistry at KMC, Manipal, later went to the U.S. in 2003. Mr. Kedlaya, known for his \u2018Panchali\u2019 role in late Udyavara Madhavacharya production, also earlier learnt Yakshagana from Guru Bannanje Sanjeeva Suvarna in Udupi. \u201cThis art form keeps me hooked to the aesthetics of this region in the United States\u201d, he said. The GCPAS Head Varadesh Hiregange moderated the discussion, release from GCPAS said. Published - September 16, 2024 08:30 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "description": "We can argue about this till the cows come home",
            "content": "What is the meaning and origin of the expression \u2018till the cows come home\u2019? (Geetha, Chennai) Coined by John Dunton, this idiom has been part of the English language for over three centuries. The expression has several different meanings. On most occasions, however, it is used to mean \u2018for a very long time\u2019. The kids were having such a good time that we ended up staying at the beach till the cows came home. I have a feeling that the two of us will be working on Hema\u2019s terrible report till the cows come home. The expression is sometimes changed to \u2018when the cows come home\u2019 to mean \u2018never\u2019. I\u2019ll get married to someone like Rajiv when the cows come home. The students are likely to call off the strike when the cows come home. In most European countries, farmers milked their cows early in the morning. Once the milking had been done, the animals were taken to the nearby fields and allowed to graze all day. They were usually walked back home late in the evening \u2013 and in some cases, early next morning. Cows, unlike other farm animals, walk slowly; their unhurried pace added to the impression of it having been a long and lengthy day. Does the word \u2018middlebrow\u2019 exist? (R Haimavathi, Nellore) Yes, it certainly does. There are three types of \u2018brows\u2019, actually \u2014 highbrow, middlebrow, and lowbrow \u2014 and all three words can be used to talk about people and things. When you refer to someone as being a \u2018highbrow\u2019, what you are implying is that the individual is an intellectual \u2014 or at least, pretends to be one. Being cultured and sophisticated, he shows interest in serious subject matter. A highbrow doesn\u2019t waste his time reading trivial publications. He likes to read about and discuss rather complicated issues. He enjoys the classics \u2014 both in terms of literature and music. I didn\u2019t particularly care for the novel. It was too highbrow for me. Seema had invited too many highbrows. The party was no fun. At the other end of the spectrum is the \u2018lowbrow\u2019. Instead of being sophisticated, he is rather crude or vulgar. He is not very intelligent, and is quite ignorant of the world around him \u2014 this individual of very little taste has very limited knowledge about various subjects. A movie or a book that is \u2018lowbrow\u2019 is one that does not require a great deal of intelligence to understand; the plot is usually simple, and the characters, black and white. Both \u2018highbrow\u2019 and \u2018lowbrow\u2019 can be used to indicate disapproval. People with lowbrow tastes will really enjoy the movie. I think Atul is too lowbrow to understand the book. A middlebrow is someone of average intelligence. He is moderately cultured and enjoys both forms of entertainment \u2014 highbrow and lowbrow. A work of art that is middlebrow is of good, but not great quality. The plot is not very complex, and therefore, easy to understand. It is very traditional. My friend is writing a novel for people with middlebrow taste. I\u2019m definitely not a lowbrow. I\u2019m more of a middlebrow than anything else. By the way, the \u2018ow\u2019 in \u2018brow\u2019 sounds like the \u2018ow\u2019 in \u2018how\u2019, \u2018cow\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019. The words are pronounced \u2018LOW-brow\u2019, \u2018HIGH-brow\u2019 and \u2018MID-el-brow\u2019 upendrankye@gmail.com Published - September 16, 2024 08:30 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Text and Context / Know Your English",

            "content": ", who has been going through a rut, showed shades of his usual form for the Stallions in his side's second game of the ongoing Champions One-day Cup in Faisalabad. Stallions lost the game having been shot out for just 105 while chasing 232 against the Markhors, however, Babar's runs and the way he scored them was a good sign for Pakistan team going into the England Test series next month. Babar scored run-a-ball 45, including 20 in just one over of the pacer Shahnawaz Dahani. Babar smashed five fours in a row against Dahani, with his strokeplay on full display at the Iqbal Stadium. After starting the eighth over of the Stallions' innings with a dot ball, Dahani banged in short on the next delivery only to be slapped by Babar towards deep mid-wicket boundary. A length ball was dabbed towards third man on the third delivery before Dahani banged in short again and Babar cut it towards backward point for third consecutive boundary. Another short ball outside the off-stump was played marvellously through covers before Dahani banged in once again on the final delivery to be pulled ferociously for another boundary towards deep mid-wicket. Babar smashed three more boundaries overall to score 45, however, none of the other batters offered any resistance as Zahid Mahmood took a five-wicket haul for the Markhors. The Stallions went from 79/2 to 105 all-out as Markhors achieved their second win in a row to begin the competition.",

            "description": "The bloody confrontation began when two officers confronted a man who entered the station without paying his fare, officials said",
            "content": "Four people were wounded at a Brooklyn train station on Sunday (September 16, 2024) when police officers shot at a man threatening them with a knife, authorities said. The people hit by police gunfire included the man with the blade, one of the officers and two innocent bystanders. The bloody confrontation began when two officers confronted a man who entered the station without paying his fare, officials said. One of the bystanders, a 49-year-old man, was hospitalized in critical condition. The man suspected of evading his fare, 37, was shot several times but was in stable condition. A 26-year-old woman suffered a graze wound. The wounded police officer had a bullet enter his torso under his armpit and lodge in his back but was also expected to recover. Interim Police Commissioner Thomas Donlan, on only his third day on the job after being appointed last week, promised a thorough investigation into the shooting. \"But right now, we are grateful that our officer will be OK,\u201d he told reporters. The shooting happened a little after 3 p.m. when two officers followed a man up the station steps to an elevated platform after seeing him enter without paying, Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said. The officers told the man to stop, but he refused, muttering \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you if you don\u2019t stop following me,\u201d Maddrey said. In the course of the encounter, the officers noticed the man had a knife, Mr. Maddrey said. They followed him on to a train that had pulled into the station and fired two Tasers, but neither incapacitated the man, Mr. Maddrey said. Mr. Maddrey said the man was advancing on the officers when the knife drawn when both officers fired multiple rounds. Both officers then gave first aid to the man, before one of them realized that he, too, had been hit by a bullet. \u201cWhile they're working on the male, they've become aware that other people are hit by fire, by gunfire as well,\u201d Mr. Maddrey said. Mayor Eric Adams visited the wounded officer in the hospital Sunday, ahead of a news conference addressing the shooting. The Democrat described the man who evaded the subway fare as a \u201ccareer criminal,\u201d saying he had over 20 arrests. Mr. Maddrey said the man had a history of mental illness. Video footage of the shooting was not immediately released Sunday. The NYPD did release a cropped image they said was of the man holding the knife, a blade about the width of the person's palm. \u201cI'm especially concerned with bystanders, people who are just trying to get where they're going being the victims\u2014harmed in this situation,\u201d Metropolitan Transportation Authority Janno Lieber said. The subway station serves the L line in the neighborhood of Brownsville. Mr. Lieber said that there are cameras inside the the train, on the platform and at the entrance. In 2019, NYPD officers accidentally shot and killed two fellow officers while confronting crime suspects in separate on-duty incidents.

The FBI has confirmed that the incident was an assassination bid, which was the second in two months on the Republican leader. The previous attempt was during a rally in Pennsylvania where he received gunshot wounds in his right ear and the gunman, Matthew Crooks, was gunned down by the Secret Service on the spot. The FBI is still investigating the case. However, in the second attempt, the gunman has been arrested and his motive behind the attack is being investigated. Former US President and Republican candidate for the November 2024 polls Donald Trump faced a second assassination attempt in two months as gunshots were heard outside a golf course in Florida where he was playing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Sunday (September 15). The incident occurred at around 1.30 pm local time as Secret Service agents spotted a person with AK-47 near the golf course. The Secret Service agents posted a few holes up from where Trump was playing noticed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle sticking through the shrubbery that lines the course, roughly 400 yards away. An agent opened fire and the gunman fled the spot in an SUV. The man was later taken into custody in a neighbouring county. His motive is unclear yet.",

Thirumavalavan, the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) leader Anbumani Ramadoss suggested to invite DMK MP Kanimozhi to Madurai. Speaking to media persons at Madurai airport, Mr Anbumani said that the DMK MP should inform her brother (Chief Minister) that the highest number of young widows were in Tamil Nadu as the lives were claimed due to consumption of liquor. Responding to the remarks by TN Minister Muthusamy that it would be practically difficult to close down TASMAC outlets, though the CM M K Stalin wished it happened, he said that it was a shame and curse on the people of Tamil Nadu. The Dravidian rule for the last 57 years in the State had not only ruined the families in the past by making them addict to the drinking habit, but also thrust the younger generation too into alcoholics, he charged. The PMK, since its inception, had been waging a war to close down the liquor shops and appealed for prohibition. Over the last several years of fights through demonstrations and agitations, 3,321 TASMAC outlets were closed. In fact, the PMK was responsible for reducing the timing of TASMAC outlets, he recalled and added that over 15000 women cadres in the PMK had gone to prisons after attacking the liquor shops in the past. The PMK leader said that in the Kallakurichi liquor tragedy, which claimed 67 lives, nearly 62 among them were from the Scheduled Castes. In the past too, only those from the Vanniyars and SCs had died due to liquor consumption. He said that above ideological differences, the VCK leader should have invited the PMK to be a part of the conference. He also urged Mr Thirumavalavan to stop describing the PMK as a caste outfit. The VCK leader should explain the reasons for campaigning for DMK candidates T R Baalu and Jagatrakshagan as they supplied nearly 20 % of their liquor from their breweries to the TASMAC outlets. \u201cIf Mr Thirumavalavan was serious about his claims on prohibition, he should answer my question,\u201d Dr Anbumani said. He said that there was nothing to glorify about the US visit of Mr Stalin as many other State CMs had attracted Rs 20000 and Rs 30000 crores of investment, while the TN CM had managed to bring in about Rs 7500 crore. On the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019s visit to Coimbatore, where a video clip of a hotelier went viral, the PMK leader said that the important points from the meeting had not been highlighted, while what was not relevant had got more space in the media Published - September 16, 2024 08:24 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "The Israeli military on Sunday said that the three were likely killed in an Israeli airstrike aimed at assassinating Hamas Northern Brigade commander Ahmed Ghandour on November 10, 2023. The Israeli military has said that three hostages, found dead in a Gaza tunnel months ago, were \"in a high probability\" mistakenly killed by the military during a November operation targeting a senior Hamas commander. The military's statement on Sunday, announcing the completion of an investigation into the deaths of Corporal Nik Beizer, Sergeant Ron Sherman, and Elia Toledano, concluded that the three were likely killed in an Israeli airstrike aimed at assassinating Hamas Northern Brigade commander Ahmed Ghandour on November 10, 2023. The findings were based on the location of the bodies relative to the strike's impact, performance analysis of the airstrike, intelligence findings, pathological reports, and conclusions from the Israeli Forensic Medicine Institute, Xinhua news agency reported. The three hostages were believed to have been held in the tunnel complex used by Ghandour. \"At the time of the strike, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) did not have information about the presence of hostages in the targeted compound,\" the military said. \"Furthermore, there was information suggesting that they were located elsewhere, and thus the area was not designated as one with suspected presence of hostages.\" The military emphasised that, since the war began on October 7, 2023, it has avoided striking areas suspected of containing hostages. \"The IDF operates a mechanism through the Headquarters of the Hostages and Missing Persons in the Intelligence Directorate, aimed at ensuring that offensive actions do not harm hostages wherever possible, and invests significant efforts in gathering information about the hostages,\" the military added. The findings are expected to further intensify nationwide protests demanding the release of nearly 101 individuals still being held by Hamas in Gaza. Families of the hostages are calling for a ceasefire agreement that would secure their release. The IDF said this month that it found the bodies of six hostages killed by Hamas and returned them to Israel. An estimated 250 people were abducted and were hostage in the Gaza Strip. More than 100 were released during a short-lived cease-fire agreement at the end of November before the deal to pause hostilities fell apart. Since then, some hostages were either rescued or found dead by the military. --IANS int/khz",

            "content": "Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was the target of an assassination attempt on Sunday while playing golf at his Florida estate. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has confirmed the incident as an \u201cattempted assassination,\u201d marking the second such attempt on Trump\u2019s life within nine weeks. Secret Service agents spotted and fired on a gunman in bushes near the property line of the golf course, a few hundred yards from where Trump was playing, law enforcement officials said. Just two months after surviving a shooting at a Pennsylvania campaign rally, where he sustained a minor injury to his right ear, Trump was once again the target of an assassination attempt. With only seven weeks remaining before the November 5 presidential election, both incidents underscore the heightened risks faced by presidential candidates in a highly polarised political environment. It remains unclear how the suspect was aware of Trump\u2019s presence at the golf course, but the incident is expected to trigger renewed scrutiny of the security measures surrounding the former president. Local authorities have revealed that the gunman who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump was positioned 400 to 500 yards away from the former president, hiding in the shrubbery at Trump International Golf Club. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw noted that individuals in the dense shrubbery are \"pretty much out of sight,\" making detection difficult. Bradshaw also highlighted the difference in security measures since Trump is no longer the sitting president. While the entire golf course would have been secured with law enforcement if Trump were still in office, current security is limited to areas the US Secret Service deems necessary, he added. Authorities have identified the man arrested for attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump as Ryan Wesley Routh. Following the incident, Routh fled in an SUV after dropping the weapon but was later apprehended in a neighbouring county. Officials reported that Routh had two backpacks hanging on a fence near the scene and was equipped with a GoPro camera. While the motive for the attack remains unclear, records from the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction show that Routh was previously convicted in 2002 for possessing a weapon of mass destruction. The investigation is ongoing. In an email to supporters, Trump said, \u201cThere were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumours start spiralling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!\u201d His running mate, JD Vance, and US Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said they spoke with Trump after the incident, and both said he was in \u201cgood spirits.\u201d Trump later returned to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach where he lives. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is probing the assassination attempt. The FBI said Trump was the target of what \u201cappears to be an attempted assassination\u201d at his golf club in West Palm Beach. The FBI is leading the investigation and working to determine a motive. Federal agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were helping investigate. Trump has not announced any changes to his schedule and is set to speak live on X on Monday night from his Mar-a-Lago resort to launch his sons\u2019 crypto platform. Meanwhile, the leaders of a congressional bipartisan task force investigating the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump said they have requested a briefing by the Secret Service. U. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat who is part of the task force, said he \u201cwill seek answers about what happened on Sunday\u201d.",

            "content": "The 76th Primetime Emmy Awards kicked off in Los Angeles on Sunday, with the historical epic Shogun poised to break records. Co-host Daniel Levy noted, \"We haven't even given out a single award tonight, and yet Shogun has already made Emmy history.\" Early winners included Jeremy Allen White for Best Actor in a Comedy Series for his role in FX's The Bear. This year's ceremony marks a return to its usual schedule after last year's delays due to Hollywood strikes. Hosts Eugene and Daniel Levy poked fun at the struggles of US broadcast TV and the classification of The Bear as a comedy. Here's the winners list: The Daily Show The Traitors Last Week Tonight With John Oliver Lamorne Morris, Fargo Jessica Gunning, Baby Reindeer Billy Crudup, The Morning Show Elizabeth Debicki, The Crown Ebon Moss-Bachrach, The Bear Liza Colo\u0301n-Zayas, The Bear Jean Smart, Hacks Slow Horses \u2013 Will Smith Baby Reindeer - Richard Gadd The Bear, Fishes - Christopher Storer Ripley - Steven Zaillian Greg Berlanti Following last year's delayed ceremony due to Hollywood strikes, the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards marked its second gala this year. Hosts Eugene and Daniel Levy opened the show with lighthearted jabs at the challenges facing US broadcast TV, tongue-in-cheekily calling the Emmys \u201cTV's biggest night for honouring movie stars on streaming services.\u201d Those who don't have cable can watch the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards using services like Sling TV, fuboTV and Hulu Plus Live TV. In India, the event is streaming exclusively on Lionsgate Play on September 16 at 5:30 am IST. However, due to the ongoing dispute between DIRECTV and Disney, DIRECTV users may face difficulties in accessing the ABC feed until a solution is found before the ceremony.",

            "content": "Vendors have put up stalls on the platforms in the Salem New Bus Stand though the Salem Corporation have warned them not to do so. The encroachments are causing inconvenience to commuters. The Salem Corporation permitted 135 shops to function in the bus stand. It includes 48 retail outlets, 56 shops on the platforms and two hotels. However, there are hundreds of vendors who have spread out their wares, including fruits and food items, on the platforms. Some even use LPG cylinders and cook food on the platforms. The Salem Corporation sent a notice to all the shops and warned that their licences will be cancelled, if they used inflammable materials. But the encroachers continue to do business and use cylinders to cook. N. Praveen Kumar, Communist Party of India (Marxist) Salem North City secretary, said that apart from encroachers, those who have taken shops legally also encroach on spaces around the shops. Except for the two hotels, all shops are 48 sq.ft. or 60 sq.ft. in size. But, the actual space they occupy is more than 200 sq.ft. each. They divide the space and rent out to more vendors. The shops are back in operation within a couple of hours of the Corporation officials evicting them. As per court order, inflammable materials should not be used on bus stand premises, except in the hotels. But over 20 eateries use LPG cylinders for cooking. A few months ago, a fire incident was reported in a shop. Since it happened at night, passengers were not affected. The civic body should take stern action against the shops and remove the encroachments, he said. Salem Suramangalam zone officials said eviction drives will be conducted regularly and steps will be taken to ensure vendors do not occupy space on the platforms.

The United States Geological Survey said the first earthquake, measuring magnitude 6.5, happened around 3:20 p.m. local time. It was located off the tip of Haida Gwaii, an archipelago located about 1,720 kilometres (1,069 miles) north of Vancouver and occurred at a depth of 33 kilometres (20 miles). Natural Resources Canada said a second earthquake, measuring 4.5, occurred about an hour later in the same area. The U.S. Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no threat of a tsunami from the quakes. No damage was reported. Ben Wilson, the food and beverage manager at the Willows Golf Course in Sandspit, British Columbia, said he was home on his break when he felt the ground shake, long enough to know what it was, but not long enough to concern him. \u201cThis one was definitely more noticeable than some, but not by any means, the biggest one I've ever felt here,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Mexico's judicial reform overhauling the country's courts, which will allow voters to elect judges , officially took effect on Sunday (September 15, 2024) after the text of the constitutional changes was published in the government gazette. The reforms mark a major legislative victory in President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's final weeks in office. Mr. Lopez Obrador, who often clashed with judges he derided as corrupt, argued the overhaul was needed to serve ordinary citizens\u2019 interests better. Critics countered that electing judges rather than appointing them, will end the judiciary\u2019s political independence while undermining investor confidence. The reform was championed by Mr. Lopez Obrador, and approved by his allies in Congress and a majority of state legislatures earlier this month. Mr. Lopez Obrador signed a decree for the reform's publication while sitting next to his successor, Claudia Sheinbaum , in a video posted on social media. The constitutional reform's publication in the government's gazette kicks off the process of preparing for the first judicial elections for federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, set for next June.

            "content": "Breakfast or no breakfast? Let your body decide! Unveiling the truth behind the breakfast debate. For years, we've been told that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but in recent times, a growing number of fitness enthusiasts and nutrition experts suggest skipping it could be the key to a leaner body. The concept of fasting\u2014especially skipping breakfast\u2014has gained popularity, with advocates claiming it aids in fat loss, boosts metabolism, and improves overall health. But is skipping breakfast really the secret to shedding those extra pounds, or is it just another fad? The Science Behind Skipping Breakfast The idea of skipping breakfast falls under the umbrella of intermittent fasting, a popular eating pattern that alternates between periods of eating and fasting. Intermittent fasting proponents argue that extending the body\u2019s natural overnight fast allows it to tap into fat stores for energy. But does skipping breakfast lead to better fat loss? Studies on intermittent fasting have shown mixed results. Some research suggests that skipping breakfast can help control calorie intake and improve fat-burning processes. When you fast, insulin levels drop, and fat stores become more accessible. This means the body might switch from burning glucose to burning fat as a fuel source. The \"Eat More, Weigh Less\" Myth One of the most common beliefs about breakfast is that eating early helps to curb hunger later in the day, preventing overeating. However, some studies show that skipping breakfast doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to increased calorie consumption at later meals. In fact, many people who skip breakfast end up consuming fewer calories overall. But it\u2019s not all black and white. For some, skipping breakfast may lead to more energy throughout the day, but for others, it could lead to blood sugar imbalances and food cravings. The key is how well your body responds to the fasting period and whether it affects your ability to maintain a healthy diet for the rest of the day. Metabolism and Muscle Mass: The Other Side of the Coin Opponents of skipping breakfast argue that fasting could slow down metabolism. The logic here is that depriving your body of food for long periods might lead it to conserve energy by slowing down your metabolic rate, making it harder to burn calories efficiently. There\u2019s also concern about muscle loss, as muscle tissue can be broken down for energy during long fasting periods. Does Skipping Breakfast Work for Everyone? While intermittent fasting, including skipping breakfast, has shown success for some individuals, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Factors such as lifestyle, activity level, and metabolic health should be considered before adopting any drastic changes in eating patterns. Skipping breakfast might be ideal for those with a sedentary lifestyle, but for athletes or people with a physically demanding routine, fueling the body with a balanced morning meal might be essential for performance. The Verdict: Is Skipping Breakfast the Key to a Leaner Body? So, is skipping breakfast the magic bullet for fat loss? The answer is: it depends. If your body thrives in a fasted state and you find skipping breakfast helps with calorie control, it may aid in your journey to a leaner physique. However, if skipping breakfast leads to energy dips, irritability, or unhealthy food choices later in the day, it could hinder your progress. The bottom line is that achieving a leaner body is more about creating a sustainable calorie deficit and following a balanced, nutrient-rich diet than focusing on when you eat. Whether you\u2019re a breakfast lover or a faster, listening to your body and tailoring your eating habits to what works best for you is the true secret to success.

            "content": "Fifty-eight-year old Ryan Wesley Routh has been identified in US media reports as the man alleged to have tried to kill former President Donald Trump as he played golf on his golf course in Florida on Sunday. US President Joe Biden has said \"there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country\" and praised law enforcement for helping keep former President Trump safe during a shooting incident that investigators said \"appears to be an attempted assassination\" of the Republican presidential nominee on Sunday. \"As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President's continued safety,\" Biden said after being briefed on the shooting at Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. He said in a statement: \"I have been briefed by my team regarding what federal law enforcement is investigating as a possible assassination attempt of former President Trump today. A suspect is in custody, and I commend the work of the Secret Service and their law enforcement partners for their vigilance and their efforts to keep the former President and those around him safe. I am relieved that the former President is unharmed. There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened.\" Fifty-eight-year old Ryan Wesley Routh has been identified in US media reports as the man alleged to have tried to kill former President Donald Trump as he played golf on his golf course in Florida on Sunday. Routh is said to be a resident of Hawaii, worked as a construction worker in North Carolina and has tried to recruit fighters in support of Ukraine in its defence against Russian invasions. The FBI said it was investigating the incident as an \"attempted assassination\". \"The FBI. has responded to West Palm Beach, Florida, and is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump,\u201d the agency said in a statement. Investigators found an AK-47 style rifle, two backpacks filled with ceramic tile and a GoPro camera that he had abandoned. This was a second assassination attempt on Trump in a little more than two months. The first was in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. He was hit in the right ear. The shooter, who was operating by himself, was killed by a law enforcement sniper. The Sunday incident took place at the Trump International Golf Club in west Palm Beach around 1:30 p.m. Investigators said a Secret Service agent moving ahead of the former president to secure the area noticed a gun sticking out from a portion of the thick foliage around the periphery of the golf course. The agent went in that direction and it was not clear yet if the suspect had opened fire. But he was about 350 to 500 yard behind -- between the fifth and sixth holes -- which was not out range for the scape on the rifle -- between. A witness saw the suspect, investigators said, took a picture of the car and the registration plate and he was pulled over shortly and taken into custody. \"There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!\" Trump said in a statement. \"Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!\" The White House said in a separate statement that President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, who are both in Washington D.C., had been briefed. \"The President and Vice-President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing. They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.\" Harris said in a post on X that she is \"glad\" the former president is safe. \"I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.\" The shooting is reported to have taken place near his Palm Beach golf course. President Trump was on course and shots were fired from the trees on the periphery, CNN said. The US Secret Service personnel returned fire in that direction.",

Biden also said that he was relieved that Trump was safe and hailed the Secret Service for their job. Gunshots were heard outside a golf course in Florida where Trump was playing. Secret Service agents, who were stationed at a different location on the golf course, spotted the barrel of an AK-style rifle emerging from a bush or shrubbery at a distance of approximately 400 yards. An agent opened fire at the man who fled the spot and was later arrested. \u201cI have been briefed by my team regarding what federal law enforcement is investigating as a possible assassination attempt of former President Trump today. A suspect is in custody, and I commend the work of the Secret Service and their law enforcement partners for their vigilance and their efforts to keep the former President and those around him safe. I am relieved that the former President is unharmed. There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cAs I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President\u2019s continued safety,\u201d the US President added. Vice President Kamala Harris, Democratic presidential candidate who is up against Trump for the November presidential polls, said that she has been briefed about the situation and there is no place for violence in America. \u201cI have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America,\u201d Harris posted on X. Trump faced a second assassination attempt in two months as gunshots were heard outside a golf course in Florida where he was playing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Sunday (September 15). The man who fired the shots, according to the authorities, pointed a rifle with a scope into Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach and was identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. The incident occurred at around 1.30 pm local time as Secret Service agents spotted a person with AK-47 near the golf course. The Secret Service agents posted a few holes up from where Trump was playing noticed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle sticking through the shrubbery that lines the course, roughly 400 yards away. An agent opened fire and the gunman fled the spot in an SUV, dropping the rifle and leaving the firearm behind along with two backpacks, a scope used for aiming and a GoPro camera, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said. The man was later taken into custody in a neighbouring county.",

This Sunday, they needed that uplifting balm more than ever.Their community is reeling confused, frustrated, hurt from false accusations that they are eating their neighbour's cats and dogs. The now viral and highly politicised rumours are being fuelled by former president Donald Trump, his running mate JD Vance and others, and violent threats against the community are upending daily life in their city.Jesus is with us in truth, and the truth is that Haitians are not eating pets and geese in Springfield, said the Rev. Carl Ruby, preaching at Central Christian Church. He invited community members to join his congregation in prayer and peaceful protest of the false rumours levelled against their Haitian neighbours.They also demanded an apology.It is truth that a retraction of these rumours will help to restore peace in Springfield,\"",

            "content": "The BJP on Sunday reiterated its demand for a NIA probe into the communal violence in Nagamangala by alleging that the local people had suspected the involvement of persons from Kerala with links to banned outfits like the PFI. In a social media post, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly R. Ashok claimed that locals also suspected that these alleged attackers had bought 150 masks and also destroyed CCTV cameras before the attack. Following this, they were of the view that the attack was pre-determined, he maintained. Arguing that there was a strong suspicion of the role of banned outfits and communal forces behind the Nagamangala attack, he said it would be difficult for the State police to solve the case. Only the NIA would be able to bring out the truth, he claimed. He also claimed that there was a suspicion whether the police were under pressure from the banned organisations as the first 23 accused in the FIR were actually victims and not the attackers. Meanwhile, former Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who is heading a fact-finding committee formed by the BJP to bring out truth with respect to the Nagamangala violence, said the committee would visit the trouble-hit town on Monday. He maintained that the Nagamangala violence was yet another instance of the law and order failure in the State. Accusing the government of indulging in appeasement of certain sections, he said such a policy had resulted in the failure of law and order.

            "content": "A delegation of Vokkaliga MLAs from the Congress, including Ministers, will call on Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday, seeking strict legal action against the former Minister Munirathna, who is accused of making derogatory references to the Vokkaliga community. The BJP legislator from R.R. Nagar is alleged to have abused the community and community women in a purported conversation on the phone with a contractor that had been leaked. A note from the office of the Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar said that the delegation will meet the Chief Minister on Monday. Meanwhile, D.K. Suresh, former MP, has asked Vokkaliga leaders in the Opposition (H.D. Kumaraswmy and R. Ashok) as to how they could support or justify the alleged abuses to the community and community women by the former BJP Minister. \u201cHow would you react if what Mr. Munirathna did had been done by a Congress leader? Do not mix politics in this. You should clarify your party\u2019s position in this regard,\u201d he told reporters. Meanwhile, The State Vokkaliga Sangha has also taken exception to his remarks. \u201cIn a democratic set-up, any elected representative has to hang his head in shame to what Mr. Muniratna has said,\u201d sangha president C.N. Balakrishna said in a press release. Published - September 16, 2024 07:00 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "In yet another such incident, former US President and current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was the target of what authorities have described as an \u201cattempted assassination\u201d at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) confirmed the attack, which marks the second attempt on Trump\u2019s life in the past nine weeks. Trump, who was on the golf course at the time of the incident, assured the public that he was unharmed and thanked law enforcement for their prompt action. According to the information, the US Secret Service agents stationed at the course played a key role in averting the attack. The officials said agents noticed the muzzle of what appeared to be an AK-style rifle protruding through shrubbery about 400 yards away from where Trump was playing. In response to the attack, one of the agents opened fire, prompting the suspected gunman to drop his weapon and flee in an SUV. The rifle, along with two backpacks, a rifle scope, and a GoPro camera used for surveillance or recording, were left behind. Meanwhile, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw confirmed that the suspect was apprehended in a neighbouring county later. Details about the suspect, including his motives, are still under investigation. Authorities are now reviewing footage from the GoPro camera and other evidence to determine whether the gunman acted alone or was part of a larger plot. In an email to supporters, Trump said: \u201cThere were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumours start spiralling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!\u201d He wrote: \u201cNothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!\u201d He returned to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach where he lives, according to a person familiar with Trump's movements who was not authorized to discuss them publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. It was the latest jarring moment in a campaign year marked by unprecedented upheaval. On July 13, Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and a bullet grazed his ear. Eight days later, Democratic President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, giving way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the party's nominee. It was not immediately clear whether the incident would affect his campaign schedule. He was set to speak from Florida about cryptocurrency live on Monday night on the social media site X for the launch of his sons' crypto platform. He planned a town hall Tuesday in Flint, Michigan, with his former press secretary, Arkansas Gov.",

            "content": "The 76th Primetime Emmy Awards are being handed out at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. For the second time in just one year, the Emmy Awards have rolled out the red carpet. This time, Netflix leads the nominations with a staggering 107 nods across 35 programs, making it the undisputed frontrunner in terms of volume. Yet, it is FX \u2014 with its 93 nominations spread across just nine shows \u2014 that is generating the most buzz for Sho\u0304gun . The Bear took most of the big comedy Emmys home in January for its first season and is expected to do the for its second. Jeremy Allen White won Best Lead Actor, Comedy while his co-stars Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Liza Colon-Zayas won in Best Supporting Actor categories. HBO, a perennial favorite, has been somewhat relegated to third place this year with 91 nominations, a far cry from its usual domination. While True Detective: Night Country is its most nominated series with 19 nods, it\u2019s clear that the titan of prestige TV is facing stiff competition from all corners. Perhaps the biggest question is whether Apple TV \u2014 with 72 nominations for shows like Palm Royale and The Morning Show \u2014 will finally take home some hardware after a record-breaking year for the platform.

            "content": "Former BJP Telangana president and Union Minister of State for Defence Bandi Sanjay Kumar, on Sunday, said the Congress government\u2019s proposed \u2018Praja Palana Dinotsvam\u2019 celebrations on September 17 is yet another sign of its \u201cdouble standards\u201d and \u201cduplicitous\u201d stance on the Hyderabad Liberation Day. \u201cWho asked the State government to change the nomenclature to \u2018Praja Palana Dinotsvam\u2019? Does it mean there was no people\u2019s governance in the previous regimes of the party? It has no right to talk about Telangana when around 1,500 lives were lost during the agitation for separate State,\u201d he said. Addressing a press conference at the Parade Grounds after inaugurating a photo exhibition along with Rajya Sabha MP K. Laxman and other party leaders, he charged that \u201cone party made use of \u2018Telangana\u2019 name, looted the State and was kicked out by the people. The same fate also awaits this government if it chooses to ignore people\u2019s sentiments. Both parties are known for boastful talk,\u201d he told mediapersons on Sunday. Acknowledging that he had received the government\u2019s invitation for the programme, he said the party leaders are ready to attend if the \u2018Praja Palana Dinotsvam\u2019 name is changed. \u201cThey (Congress leaders) can attend our Hyderabad Liberation Day celebrations here at Parade Grounds after their official function. There is no harm in having two programmes and our programme is apolitical,\u201d he maintained. The BJP leader wondered why the Congress had never bothered to celebrate Liberation Day when in power and took objection to Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy praising Majlis leaders when the party itself is \u201can offshoot of the Razakkars responsible for atrocities on the people of Telangana during the Nizam\u2019s rule\u201d. The Modi government has decided to make people aware of the circumstances in which the Hyderabad State was joined into the Indian Union through Operation Polo by the then Home Minister Sardar Patel. \u201cDid they (Congress party) ever recognise the services of valiant freedom fighters behind the Telangana struggle or even Sardar Patel,\u201d asked Mr. Sanjay Kumar. He also called for inclusion of Sardar Patel\u2019s life and that of many unsung martyrs in the textbooks for the future generations to understand their contributions. Earlier, legislature party leader A. Maheshwar Reddy told another press meet that Congress-ruled Karnataka has been celebrating the day and there is no reason for Telangana government to do the same instead of getting \u201cworried\u201d about losing minority votes or \u201cfearing\u201d Majlis party. Even if the Chief Minister tries to coin a new nomenclature for the day, people of Telangana were well aware of Liberation Day struggles, he maintained.

            "description": "Scientists are challenging the view that the dodo was a slow, bloated animal doomed to extinction",
            "content": "The moment you hear the words \u201cextinct\u201d and \u201cbird\u201d, the dodo is probably the first creature on your mind, probably from an image in a school textbook you knew from years ago. The dodo\u2019s significance transcended the boundaries of natural history. It has entered popular culture, immortalised in literature as a whimsical character with a stutter in Lewis Caroll\u2019s \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019. In the story, the bird is large, awkward, and the inspiration for the epithet \u201cdumb as a dodo\u201d. \u2018We just didn\u2019t care\u2019 But were dodos really slow-minded? To set the record straight, researchers from the University of Southampton, the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and the Natural History Museum combed through 400 years of research papers on the dodo and its sister species, the solitaire, and also examined the only existing soft tissue from the dodo. Citing written records from their extensive review, the researchers have now challenged the widely held view that the dodo was a slow, bloated animal doomed to extinction. Instead, they have said, they may have been fast-moving birds that thrived in the forest. \u201cThe dodo and the solitaire went extinct because of our hubris. We just didn\u2019t care, and in the 17th century, we didn\u2019t believe we could affect \u201cgod\u2019s creation\u201d and destroy species through our actions,\u201d Neil Gostling of the University of Southampton and the supervising author of the team\u2019s paper, said. The study was published in the August issue of the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society . What doomed the dodo? Late into the 18th century and for some part of the 19th, many naturalists believed the dodo was a fiction. \u201cSome even considered it mythical, like the phoenix,\u201d Gostling said. Thanks to the work of Victorian-era scientists, we know dodos and solitaires were flightless birds endemic to the forests of Mauritius. But how they got to the island wasn\u2019t clear. In a 2002 study , researchers examined dodo DNA and found they belonged to the family of doves and pigeons. The dodo\u2019s closest relative was the Nicobar pigeon. Dodos and solitaires weren\u2019t always flightless. Over hundreds of thousands of years, they became larger and lived closer to the ground. They also had little competition for their food sources. So when Dutch settlers got to Mauritius in 1598, they found a tall, big, and flightless bird. Its life changed for the worse then. Their numbers began to dwindle. In less than a century, the dodo and its relatives went extinct. The paucity of natural predators rendered the birds brave and they were less wary of humans than they should have been. This said, contrary to common belief, the dodo didn\u2019t go extinct because it was prized as food. Since the birds nested in the ground, pigs from the Dutch vessels ate their eggs, rats and cats preyed on their chicks, and goats trampled the nests, Gostling said. The bird is the word A hundred years after meeting the first humans, dodos and solitaires were wiped out. As a result, natural history collections have little material evidence of the birds\u2019 lives. Instead, most early scientific deliberations banked on artist\u2019s impressions and sailors\u2019 reports and were often confused. Separately, the ever-changing naming schemes for animals in the 19th and the 20th centuries and the lack of a type specimen \u2014 a single, well-preserved body that serves as the species\u2019 official reference \u2014 for dodos and solitaires led to a long history of misidentification. Linnaean taxonomy, the current universally accepted method to name and categorise life-forms, kicked in more than a hundred years after the birds went extinct. In their study, Gostling and his team confirmed the dodo belonged to the Columbidae family of pigeons and doves. This matters: \u201cIn order to understand their biology, we first have to ensure that their taxonomy is correct, as this is the framework that explains relationships in the tree of life,\u201d Gostling said. Not so slow, dodo While going through centuries of academic records and sailors\u2019 drawings and notes, the researchers came across an eyewitness account by a Dutch mariner named Volkert Evertsz. He survived a shipwreck and ended up on Mauritius in 1662. Evertsz described a bird he called \u201cdodderse\u201d to German scholar Adam Olearius in 1668, adding they were \u201clarger than geese\u201d, couldn\u2019t fly because they lacked wings, and ran fast. This ability to run is reflected in the dodo\u2019s anatomy. Birds close their toes with the help of tendons that run through a groove found in a large bone in their leg called the tibiotarsus. Evidence from existing dodo bones suggest the groove housed a tendon as big as the tibiotarsus bone, an anatomical feature seen in contemporary birds that are good runners. Gostling said sailors\u2019 journals from visits to Mauritius greatly contributed to shaping the perception of dodo as unintelligent birds. These accounts often described capturing dodos by dozens in a single day as they didn\u2019t try to evade capture; the sailors thus believed they were slow-witted. Today we know this needn\u2019t be true. A dodo-led future The story of the dodo\u2019s extinction has long served as a cautionary tale about the consequences of human exploitation and neglect, and could hold lessons for our future. \u201cUsing cutting-edge computer technology, we are piecing together how the dodo lived and moved. This isn\u2019t just about satisfying our curiosity. By understanding how birds evolved in the past, we are learning valuable lessons that could help protect bird species today,\u201d Markus Heller, a professor of biomechanics at the University of Southampton and the co-author of the paper, said in a statement . Gostling added that a deeper knowledge of the dodo\u2019s habitat is crucial as it could hold secrets to preventing further biodiversity loss. The team is planning a major new project with scientists from around the world, including from Mauritius. They hope to demonstrate the fact that the dodo was well adapted to its environment and wasn\u2019t \u2018doomed\u2019 to extinction. After all, it had got by just fine on Mauritius for millions of years. \u201cThe message that we still need to heed is that humans need to tread lightly on the earth,\u201d Gostling said. \u201cYou can excuse the ignorance of 17th century sailors, they had no idea what they were doing. We do. We still thoughtlessly affect the environment, we still see plants and animals going extinct.\u201d Sanjukta Mondal is a chemist-turned-science-writer with experience in writing popular science articles and scripts for STEM YouTube channels.

While the alliance failed to topple the Trinamool Congress government, it changed Left politics in West Bengal forever, as the CPI(M) emerged as a more practical and accommodating political force, setting aside decades of political animosity with the Congress. Enduring alliance A couple of years later, in 2018, the CPI(M) general secretary faced stiff opposition from his party\u2019s central committee, rejecting his proposal for an alliance with Congress. Despite the opposition, the West Bengal unit of the party supported Sitaram Yechury, and the electoral understanding with Congress has continued till today, and both parties fought the 2024 Lok Sabha polls together. \u201cSitaram\u2019s contribution is that one can only break the binary of the BJP and Trinamool Congress by using the left alternative. It can be done by uniting all left and democratic forces, including the Congress,\u201d CPI(M) West Bengal State Secretary Md. Salim said. Mr. Salim added that Sitaram Yechury\u2019s favourite line was that the Left in India cannot survive without the revival of the CPI(M) in West Bengal. Veteran Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya said that with Sitaram Yechury at the helm, the Congress realised that it could work with the CPI(M) leadership. Mr. Bhattacharya, who has represented West Bengal in the Upper House, added that there have always been two views in the Congress party whether the party should go with the Trinamool Congress or with the CPI(M) and it was because of Mr. Yechury that an alliance between the Congress and CPI(M) was formed. Sitaram Yechury represented West Bengal in the Rajya Sabha from 2005 to 2017. He spoke Bengali and loved interacting with politicians and people from the State. During his media interactions in West Bengal, the CPI(M) general secretary would refer to the \u201ccompetitive communalism\u201d of both the Trinamool Congress and BJP in promoting religious events like Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti, often resulting in communal tensions. Steadfast optimism Despite failing to register much electoral success, the CPI(M) general secretary, speaking at a press conference in June 2024, expressed the hope that the CPI(M) would break the Trinamool-BJP binary in West Bengal by continuing to fight for the people\u2019s rights and livelihood. Reflecting on the CPI(M)\u2019s electoral performance in the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls, Mr. Yechury was hopeful that a new party leadership was emerging in the State. \u201cIn Bengal, our party campaigned very well, irrespective of what the results were. Owing to our young leaders, a new kind of party is being formed in Bengal, which will benefit both the State as well as the country,\u201d he had said at WB CPI(M) headquarters.

India-B skipper and opener Abhimanyu Easwaran carried his bat with a knock of 157 (286b, 14x4, 1x6). After Kamboj had Rahul Chahar bowled in the first over of the day, Abhimanyu brought up his 150 with back-to-back fours off pacer Vijaykumar Vyshak in the second over. He cut to the sweeper boundary, before inside-edging past the keeper. Kamboj went on to rattle the stumps for Navdeep Saini, and have Mukesh Kumar caught by Sai Sudharsan at short leg. India-B was awarded five penalty runs for time wasting by the fielding side (law 41.9.3). Surprise decision Surprisingly, India-C skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad didn\u2019t choose to enforce the follow-on. Batting again, Ruturaj hit a 93-ball 62 (8x4, 1x6), before he was trapped in front by leg-spinner Chahar. After Sai Sudharsan fell early, missing a drive to have his off-stump uprooted by pacer Mukesh, Ruturaj and Rajat Patidar (42, 84b, 5x4) added 96 for the second wicket. At one point, there were four boundaries in 10 balls. Patidar essayed the cover drive once and the square drive twice for three fours in a Saini over, while Ruturaj cut left-arm spinner Sai Kishore for a four behind square. Ruturaj also flicked aerially off Saini and pulled a short ball from Nitish Kumar Reddy for a four and a six to deep midwicket. Musheer gets Patidar Musheer Khan, who rehearsed bowling in the nets at lunch, bowled in the second session and dismissed Patidar leg-before.

            "content": "Rail users in Coimbatore have appealed to the Railways to operate a Vande Bharat Express service to Mangaluru and Thiruvananthapuram, considering the passenger movement between the Kongu region and the two cities. The service would immensely benefit students, professionals and pilgrims travelling to the places, they added. Currently, there are only two daily trains available at convenient timings to travel between Coimbatore and Mangaluru. The first option is the Coimbatore-Mangaluru Intercity Superfast Express, which departs from Coimbatore at 6 a.m. and arrives in Mangaluru at 1.15 p.m. The second option is the West Coast Super Fast Express, which leaves at 9.30 p.m. and arrives in Mangalore at 5.50 a.m. the following day. The other two trains, the Coimbatore-Mangalore Express (7.50 a.m. to 6.40 p.m.) and the Chennai Egmore-Mangalore Express (10 a.m. to 7.15 p.m.), have longer travel durations and operate during the day. The Vande Bharat train to Mangaluru takes less than six hours of travel, said J. Sathish, Director, Kongu Global Forum. There are a large number of people from the Kasargod-Mangalore belt settled in Coimbatore and surrounding areas. A quick connectivity to Kozhikode and Mangaluru will also be of value to tourists thronging resorts along the West Coast, he said. Similarly, there will be abundant patronage by tourists if the Railways operates a Vande Bharat Express to Thiruvananthapuram, he said. Meanwhile, the Welfare Association of Rail Passengers in Coimbatore-Pollachi-Palani-Dindigul (WARP-CPPD) has sought a daily express train between Dindigul and Erode via Pollachi and Coimbatore. The train, when operated with starting time of 5 a.m. will benefit passengers from Dindigul, Oddanchatram, Palani, and Udumalpet, enabling them to commute to Coimbatore, Pollachi, Kinathukadavu, Tiruppur, and Erode, Association president and secretary S. Devadass and K. Mohan Kumar said in a letter to the Divisional Railway Manager, Salem Division.

            "content": "YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on September 15 (Sunday) came down heavily on Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for writing a letter to the Union government that MBBS seats were not required in medical colleges in the State. Taking to X on Sunday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said it was appalling that instead of making the best use of the increase in the MBBS seats for the State, the government wrote a letter to the Centre saying it was unnecessary, at a time when the medical colleges in neighbouring States were leaving no stone unturned to get permission for new medical colleges and increase the MBBS seats. \u201cIt\u2019s reprehensible and immoral for the State government to undermine its own efforts in strengthening the public health sector. What kind of administration is this, where our State\u2019s allotted seats are being rejected,\u201d he asked. The former Chief Minister said providing quality education and healthcare was the fundamental responsibility of the governments, and access to the same was the people\u2019s right. No family should have to sell assets to ensure their children received good education and healthcare, he said. Recognising it, the YSRCP government had brought about revolutionary reforms and started the construction of 17 medical colleges with an investment of \u20b98,480 crore. The YSRCP government had aimed at opening one medical college per parliamentary constituency. However, the present government plans to shirk its responsibility and avoid discharging its duties, he alleged. \u201cCan it be called a government?\u201d he asked. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that as per schedule, another five colleges in Madanapalle, Pulivendula, Adoni, Markapuram, and Paderu were supposed to provide 750 seats this year. \u201cWhat is the reason for limiting the number of seats in Paderu college to 50? Was it not true that classes had started in five colleges during 2023-24 academic year, adding 750 MBBS seats to the State?\u201d he asked. Many poor children had secured seats and were studying medicine, he said, adding that Mr. Naidu was going back on his electoral promise of providing free medical education. The government was all set to privatise the medical colleges, he alleged. The YSRCP would complete the construction of medical colleges soon after coming to power, he asserted.

            "content": "Id-e Milad, Milad\u2013un\u2013Nabi, Mawlid which falls on September 16 is a very special occasion for Muslims and commemorates the birth anniversary of Prophet Mohammad who is regarded as the last Prophet sent by Allah. This day usually falls in the third month of the Islamic calendar Rabi\u2019 al-awwal on the 12th day. In the beginning it was a day of mourning in memory of the Prophet. However, it is believed that by the 13th century a transition took place in observing the 12th day of Rabi\u2019 al-awwal from mourning to celebrations. It was the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt who formally declared Id\u2013ul\u2013Milad a day of commemoration of the Prophet and this day has evolved since then across the Islamic world. This day is celebrated by both the Shias and the Sunnis across the world. It is a day for cleaning and decorating homes, wearing new clothes, exchanging greetings and holding feasts. The day marks participation in large processions, special congregations at mosques, seeking forgiveness and self-reflection, educating people about the teachings and lessons from Prophet Mohammad\u2019s life. The Shias focus on performing acts of charity and service, distributing food, clothes and offering other monetary help to the poor and participating in candlelight processions. The Sunnis focus on the recitation of nasheeds , and chanting devotional songs, decoration of mosques with lights, holding banners and flags. Thus this day becomes a day of rejoicing and celebration for Muslims across the world, said Prof. Kumool Abbi.

            "content": "The Congress can claim true victory only when party workers belonging to socially backward communities are equipped with political power in the local body elections, said Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, indicating that the polls would be held once the Backward Classes reservations issues are untangled. \u201cWe as leaders may win as MPs and MLAs but the real victory is when the Congress cadre sweep the local body elections,\u201d he said, crediting the party\u2019s comeback to power after a decade to them. The Chief Minister was speaking at a programme at Gandhi Bhavan where Mahesh Kumar Goud took charge as the new Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief on Sunday. Extending complete support to the new TPCC president, the CM called for better coordination between the party and the government to get a second term in 2028 and make Rahul Gandhi the Prime Minister, winning 15 Lok Sabha seats in Telangana. \u201c2023 victory is the semi-final and 2029 Parliament elections will be the final. Rahul Gandhi should hoist the national flag at Red Fort,\u201d he said. Criticising Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) senior leader T. Harish Rao, he slammed him for not keeping his promise of resigning if farm loans were waived. He went further, ridiculing Mr. Rao\u2019s height and demanding his immediate resignation, citing the government\u2019s decision to waive farm loans up to \u20b92 lakh for eligible farmers. Issuing a warning to the BRS, he noted that while the new TPCC president may seem soft, but he is prepared to retaliate in a language the BRS understands. Referring to the \u2018violence\u2019 at BRS MLA Kaushik Reddy\u2019s residence, he questioned who sparked the conflict. \u201cYou provoked another MLA with indecent remarks, and now you are crying hoarse when he retaliated,\u201d he said, blaming Mr. Kaushik Reddy for the provocative comments. Reflecting on his tenure as TPCC president, Mr. Reddy highlighted the several campaigns launched to expose the unfulfilled promises of the BRS, with Mr. Mahesh Goud, as working president, playing a key role in their success. \u201cWithin three months of coming to power, we have provided 30,000 jobs, and another 35,000 positions will be filled soon,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) working president K.T. Rama Rao has sought clarity on the future of the Pharma City project. Expressing concern over the government\u2019s reported move to scrap the Hyderabad Pharma City project, he said that shelving it would negatively affect the State\u2019s economy and workforce. The former industries minister addressed a letter regarding the matter to Chief Minister A.Revanth Reddy on Sunday. \u201cThe previous BRS government embarked on a journey to develop the world\u2019s largest integrated pharma cluster,\u201d he said and emphasised that Telangana accounts for 40% of India\u2019s pharmaceutical production and houses over 1,000 life sciences companies, contributing to an ecosystem valued at $80 billion. \u201cThe Pharma City, with an estimated investment potential of $9.7 billion, was expected to create over 5 lakh direct jobs, making it a cornerstone of the State\u2019s economic growth strategy,\u201d he added. Mr. Rama Rao questioned the reported reversal of the project by the Congress government, stating that it was done without proper consultation with local stakeholders, including farmers who had contributed their land. He highlighted a recent directive from the High Court, which stated that the land acquired for Pharma City could not be repurposed for other projects, urging the government to reconsider its position in light of this ruling. He demanded a clear and prompt response from the government regarding its stance on the project. He further asserted that if the project is not pursued in its original form, the government should return the acquired land to the farmers per provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. He said that any scaling down or abandonment of the project would harm Telangana\u2019s efforts to become a global hub for life sciences and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

            "content": "Trivandrum, Sept. 15: There was no proposal now to abolish licence fees for radio sets because of the financial stringency, Mr. L.K. Gujral, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, said at a \u201cMeet the Press\u201d programme in the Trivandrum station of AIR to-day. Pointing out that rural areas did not have more than 10 to 15 per cent of the total number of 1.5. crore licensed radio sets, he said this situation could perhaps be improved by abolishing licence fees for radio sets in those areas. But the more important thing would be to make available low-cost radio sets. He said radio coverage had improved now to 90 per cent of the areas and 93 per cent of the population of the country from 67.6 per cent of the area and 56.6 per cent of the population at the beginning of the Fourth Plan. It was proposed to set up two transmitters as also studios in Lakshadweep. The areas left uncovered were broader areas and socially depressed areas. He said commercial services would be started from the Trivandrum and Calicut stations in a couple of months. On absorbing casual artistes into regular service, Mr. Gujral said he was personally against having two parallel services and in favour of a merger. But the leaders of their union were not for it. He said he was taking up the question of extending the pension benefit to these artistes.

            "content": "Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday (September 15, 2024) assured the residents of Mahis tehsil that the forest department, district administration and police will continue working until the wolf threat ends . He also conducted an aerial survey of the region and met families of those who lost their lives in the recent wolf attacks during the human-wildlife conflict. The priority is to capture the remaining wolf safely and shooting it will be the last resort, said Mr. Adityanath who also met the injured and inquired about their well-being. According to an official statement, the Chief Minister assessed the relief efforts, including the compensation provided and medical assistance given to the injured. While addressing the media, Mr. Adityanath emphasised that the safety of the public is the government's top priority and said that the forest department, district administration and police, will continue working in the area until the threat is fully eliminated. Also read | Bahraich wolf attack: Massive search operation underway to catch \u2018killer\u2019 wolves \"The government has classified human-wildlife conflict as a disaster. In the event of loss of life, an immediate compensation of \u20b95 lakh is provided to the victim's family. Anti-rabies treatment has also been made available for those injured in wild animal attacks,\" he said. The chief minister further said 25 teams, comprising 165 personnel from the forest department, have been deployed to ensure public safety. Four thermal drones have also been deployed for monitoring. \"The primary objective is to capture the wolf safely. However, if the animal's aggressive behaviour escalates or poses a threat to human life, orders have been issued to shoot it as a last resort, with other measures being prioritised first,\" he said. \"There have been casualties in the Mahsi assembly constituency, located near the river, due to wolf attacks over the past two months. Several children have also been injured. Upon receiving the first reports from public representatives, the administration was directed to launch a comprehensive campaign, after which the Forest Minister and department officials were dispatched with a response team,\" he said. Within a 20-25 km radius, eight people have lost their lives in the last two months, and five wolves have been successfully captured so far, though one remains elusive, he said. Mr. Adityanath said that the area is prone to wild animal incidents, particularly during this season when the floods force animals to migrate closer to human settlements in search of prey, leading to attacks where vulnerable targets are found. The first incident occurred on July 17, when a wolf attacked a one-year-old child, and the attacks continued intermittently every four to five days, he said. The most recent fatality was reported on September 1, and while an attack on a child was reported on September 2-3, no further incidents have occurred since then. He said, \"All affected families in this region have permanent homes, although some lacked doors at the entrance. Provisions were made to install doors using additional funds.\" \"Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, each family was given a toilet. For those who still lacked this facility, additional toilets have been arranged. Lighting and regular patrolling have also been ensured for safety,\" he said. The Chief Minister directed that eligible individuals, who are yet to receive housing, should be immediately provided homes under the Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana. He interacted warmly with the children during his visit, asking their names and distributing chocolates.

While apologising for the inconvenience, IndiGo said its airport team immediately offered assistance to the affected customers and provided refreshments and necessary arrangements. On Sunday morning, a passenger on X said the flight was stuck for four hours due to a technical problem and that the immigration authority was not giving permission to offload the passengers.

            "content": "The tweet came as a surprise, even from the provocative Donald Trump : \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" the former president said Sunday (September 15, 2024). Though the all-caps post came without accompanying commentary or explanation, the context was clear. On Tuesday, just minutes after a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that Republican Trump was widely seen as losing, the superstar singer/songwriter posted a message on Instagram saying she would be voting for his Democratic rival , calling Harris a \"steady-handed, gifted leader.\" Celebrity endorsements rarely carry enormous weight, but the hugely popular Swift is seen as being in a class of her own, with more than 400 million followers on Instagram, TikTok and other social media platforms \u2014 10 million of whom \"liked\" her Instagram post. \"Going after Taylor Swift is a genuinely bad campaign strategy,\" said one poster on social media platform X. \"Taylor doesn't get mad, she gets even.\" It was not clear what Trump hoped to gain by attacking Swift, though he may calculate that any publicity is better than none. He has been criticized, even by fellow Republicans, for his recent association with conspiracy-minded right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, who has at times joined him on his campaign plane. The 31-year-old Loomer \u2014 who has called the Sept. 11 terror attacks an \"inside job\" and said some recent mass shootings were staged by Democrats \u2014 recently suggested that Swift had entered an \"arranged relationship\" with football star Travis Kelce \"to influence the 2024 election.\" There is no evidence to support any of those claims.

            "content": "Having completed 10 years of its Parivartan initiative and spent over \u20b95,100 crore in various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects across India, private sector lender HDFC Bank has announced to positively impact the lives of several lakh people by the next year. Last week, the bank organised a visit to locations in and around Varanasi to showcase some of its projects. These include projects in Jamapur village and Sarthak Skill Centre in Varanasi city. Stating that it had already positively impacted the lives of over 10 crore people mostly in rural India, the bank said its goals for 2025 include increasing the income of 5 lakh marginal farmers earning less than \u20b960,000 annually, bringing two lakh acres of land under irrigation, supporting 25,000 community enterprises and improving education for 20 lakh students. The other targets for next year include skilling nearly 2 lakh individuals to equip them with capabilities that drive self-sufficiency, development and support for 20,000 institutions to promote local economies, cultivation of 1 lakh acres of farmland to increase food security and rural income, and scholarships for 25,000 meritorious underprivileged students to improve access to education. The bank said it had already surpassed its initial tree plantation target, with 38 lakh trees already planted against the FY25 goal of 25 lakh. The lender said since 2014, Parivartan has grown into one of India\u2019s largest CSR programmes, active in 28 States and 8 Union Territories, making significant strides in areas of education, skill development, healthcare, and financial inclusion. \u201cToday, business performance for profit making enterprises stands redefined. Social impact is an integral part of business performance. HDFC Bank Parivartan comprises multiple programmes with a focus on giving back to the community as well as supporting sustainable development,\u201d said Kaizad M. Bharucha, Deputy Managing Director, HDFC Bank, while interacting with presspersons. \u201cWe believe that collaboration [with NGOs] is key. Economic and financial wellbeing of society is what every responsible lender should aspire for. Our commitment to this principle is underscored in our CSR programme,\u201d he said. Emphasising that the bank had been focusing on sustainable growth, especially in rural India, through the Holistic Rural Development Programme, Nusrat Pathan, CSR Head of HDFC Bank said, \u201cWith over 65% of India\u2019s population residing in rural areas, we strongly believe that inclusive development can only be attained when the prosperity and livelihood in villages keeps pace with the growth. \u201cWe prioritise rural areas for our programme and currently 70% of our programmes are being implemented in such areas,\u201d she added. The bank said since its inception the programme has reached over 9,270 villages and more than 10 lakh households. \u201cThe bank\u2019s social outreach covers 85 out of the 112 aspirational districts in India, focusing on empowering marginalised communities, especially women, through targeted interventions,\u201d it said.

            "content": "Political parties and women right activists on Sunday demanded punitive action against irresponsible policemen after an incident of a woman sweeper, who works at the Ayodhya Ram Janmbhoomi temple complex, alleged of being gang-raped, and accused the police of delaying in action after the crime. According to the complaint lodged by the 20-year-old woman at the Ayodhya\u2019s Cantt police station, she was gang-raped on three different occasions between August 16 and 25. The victim approached the police on August 26, but her complaint was registered only on September 2 \u201cPolice are not able to give justice for the rape victim, instead they are threatening her. Police who are responsible for this should be suspended immediately. The law-and-order situation in the State has reached a low level,\u201d said Urmila Verma, a Lucknow based women\u2019s rights activist. Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav also alleged that such incidents highlight that courage of criminals are high. \u201cThe video statement of a gangrape victim in Ayodhya has revealed the root cause of the increasing harassment and atrocities against women in Uttar Pradesh.. The victim had to suffer a lot to file a report due to some insensitive policemen. Due to the complexity of filing a report, many crimes are not even registered, which boosts the confidence of the criminals. There should be justice for the victim and strict action should be taken against the criminals as well as the irresponsible policemen,\u201d said Mr. Yadav. The police have so far arrested five persons, including a minor, in connection with the case. Ayodhya Police registered a case under Sections 127(2) (wrongful confinement), 75 (sexual harassment) and 70(1) (gang rape) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

            "content": "Indian driver Kush Maini on Sunday survived a horrifying crash after he stalled at the start of the feature race in Formula 2, a support race to Formula 1. The scary incident occurred on the opening lap of the Formula 2 race which preceded the Formula 1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix . The 23-year-old Indian had nowhere to go at the race start as his car's engine stopped working suddenly. That left fellow drivers Josep Maria Marti and Oliver Goethe unsighted, leading to a massive collision. The rear of Maini's car was totally destroyed by the impact of the crash and fortunately, he came out of it unscathed. Maini's father Gautam confirmed to PTI that his son is doing fine. \"He is doing okay. As part of the standard protocol all medical check ups were conducted on Kush and all reports are normal,\" he said. Maini, representing Invicta Racing in his second Formula 2 season, is 11th in the standings. The race was won by Richard Verschoor of Trident. Following the investigation of the incident, the stewards handed the Indian a 10-second time penalty for causing the collision. \"After the race, the Stewards heard from the Team Representative and examined available video evidence before determining that the driver of Car 9 had failed to engage the Start Set Up Procedure for the start of the race, an error that led to the car stalling on the grid causing the subsequent collision. \"The Stewards determined that because of this, Maini was wholly responsible for the collision and, as a result, elected to hand him a 10-second time penalty. With Maini not finishing the Feature Race, his time penalty has been converted into a five-place grid penalty,\" read a Formula 2 statement. Maini will serve the penalty in the next race. Safety has improved drastically in motorsport over the past two decades but the sport remains dangerous. Formula 2 driver Anthoine Hubert had succumbed to his injuries following an accident at the iconic Spa Francorchamps circuit in Belgium in 2019. The Frenchman was only 22. Jules Bianchi, who was only 25, had died following a collision with a recovery vehicle during the Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix in 2014. The FIA had introduced Halo, a head protecting device, on all Formula 1 cars post the fatal accident.

            "content": "After an 11-day hunger strike, Panchu Dhaikar, 62, and six fellow protesters finally saw relief on September 13 when the Mirzapur district administration yielded to their demand to withdraw its decision to award management rights of the Bhogaon ghat to a contractor. Located on the banks of the Ganga, the ghat is the district\u2019s largest cremation ground and revered as Chota Kashi. \u201cWe were determined to continue our hunger strike despite the heat and a fellow protester being hospitalised as it was a matter of survival for us,\u201d said Mr. Dhaikar, who led the protest under the banner of the Dom-Dhaikar Ekta Samiti. The protest, which began on September 2, drew hundreds of supporters, including women. The administration ultimately relented, canceling the contract in a letter addressed to the contractor, Ramesh Kumar Singh. \u201cIn view of the adverse situation emerging in maintaining the ghat, the contract is being cancelled. Please return the register and other material in your possession,\u201d stated the letter from Surendra Kumar Verma, a senior district officer. With the Dom-Dhaikar community, a Scheduled Caste group, performing the cremation of bodies according to Hindu tradition for generations, the contract threatened the livelihoods of 100 families in the area, said social activist Harish Chandra Kevat, who supported the strike. \u201cThe contractor being given the rights to manage the affairs of the ghat was unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u2018Bid to destroy the poor\u2019 The community vowed to resist any future attempts to threaten their livelihood, viewing such moves as \u201cnefarious attempts to destroy poor and marginalised people under the guise of regulating cremation grounds\u201d. The community members argued that introducing a contractual system would erode ancient traditions and social norms built on mutual consent. \u201cWe won\u2019t let government or private entities harm our livelihood. Did the government think even once about the plight of the 100-odd Dom-Dhaikar community members if they were displaced from work?\u201d Mr. Dhaikar said.

            "content": "Oscar Piastri won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after a late crash impacted the race and required it to finish behind a virtual safety car. The win, combined with the fourth-place finish of McLaren teammate Lando Norris, gave the team a 20-point lead over Red Bull in the constructors standings. Red Bull had topped the standings for the past 55 races; McLaren last held the position in 2014. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) started from the pole position but Piastri made his move at the start of lap 20, after the drivers' lone pit stop, with a bold decision to pass Leclerc. As the race progressed, and with Leclerc's tires having given out in the final five laps, Leclerc did all he could to try to hold off Sergio Perez (Red Bull) and Carlos Sainz (Ferrari). And as Perez tried to pass Leclerc, Sainz got past Perez, and the two drivers got tangled and wound up touching the barrier, forcing them both out of the race. \"After the stop, I saw we were pretty close again and I felt like we had a little bit of extra grip and I had to go for it,\" Piastri said. \"I knew that if I didn't get past at the start of the stint, I was never going to get past, so I went for a pretty big lunge but managed to pull it off and then hang on for dear life for the next 35 laps. ... It definitely goes down as one of the better races of my career.\" George Russell (Mercedes) was third and Max Verstappen (Red Bull) fifth in the race at Baku City Circuit in Baku, Azerbaijan.

            "description": "This new frontier in political campaigning marks a transformative shift in the democratic process, but the rulebook remains stuck in the past",
            "content": "Imagine a summer evening in the United Kingdom, right before the Brexit referendum. Social media was flooded with posts and advertisements, each one more eye-catching than the other. But among these, a campaign called \u2018Leave.EU\u2019 began to stand out. The messages played on fears, hopes, and a sense of lost identity. \u2018Leave.EU\u2019 harnessed digital platforms to target individuals with calculated and data-driven content, shaping their perceptions and pushing them towards voting to leave the European Union. Today, as we look back at the Brexit referendum, it serves as a potent reminder of how the structure of democracy is increasingly being defined by technology. Digital platforms, once seen as great equalisers that empowered the masses and amplified previously unheard voices, have become a double-edged sword. We see a similar trend in India where digital campaigns are now central to electoral strategies not only by national parties but even by regional parties. The same tools that can empower voters can also distort public discourse, as shown by the growing use of digital political advertisements by political parties. This was highlighted by the Lokniti-Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) studies on digital campaigns during the 18th election to the Lok Sabha (April--June 2024). Indian elections: Tracking misinformation, AI misuse and safeguards The economics The expenditure reports from the 2023 Karnataka Assembly election clearly illustrate the translation of economic power into digital influence. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spent \u20b97,800 lakh on digital advertisements, which is 52% of its total \u201cparty propaganda\u201d budget. The Indian National Congress, on the other hand, spent \u20b94,900 lakh, which is 55% of its total \u201cparty propaganda\u201d budget. Conventional tools of publicity or propaganda such as flags, billboards, public meetings, and rallies, made up only 16% of the BJP\u2019s and 7% of the Congress\u2019s total propaganda spending. This shows a strategic shift toward digital platforms in the electoral strategies of political parties. Further underscoring this trend, the BJP became the first Indian political party to spend over \u20b9116 crore on Google ads in just five months, from January 2024. During the 2024 general election period from April 19 to June 1, 89,000 advertisements posted by the BJP were running on Google, on which more than \u20b968 crore was spent. In contrast, 2,900 advertisements posted by the Congress were running during the same period, on which over \u20b933 crore was spent. An additional layer to this digital strategy is the use of micro-targeting, based on location, with parties reaching specific audiences all the way down to the panchayat level in each advertisement. The BJP, for instance, was found to micro-target more than 1,700 pin codes in a single advertisement, demonstrating the profound capability of digital platforms in shaping electoral narratives with precision. This new frontier in political campaigning, where financial resources translate directly into targeted digital influence, marks a transformative shift in the democratic process. Also Read: Elections 2024 | How far will AI go? The narrative While the financial clout of major political parties is well documented, a more insidious force, or third-party campaigners, operates in the background. Although the information on Google Ads expenditure is publicly accessible, there is another ship at play, one not merely loaded with funds but armed with a potent mix of influence and manipulation \u2014 quietly anchored at the \u201coffshore islands of parties,\u201d and far from scrutiny and oversight. These \u2018offshore islands\u2019 represent third-party campaigners, a new phenomenon in Indian elections. Another study conducted by the Lokniti-CSDS, analysing 31 third-party campaigners on Meta, showed that these entities spent over \u20b92,260 lakh in just 90 days leading up to June 29, 2024. This brings up important questions about the motivations behind such substantial financial outlays. What makes these groups spend so much money on campaigns for certain parties or candidates? The modus operandi of these campaigners suggests a possible and covert quid pro quo with political parties, where the parties might be pulling the strings from behind. Moreover, the content propagated by these campaigners is often more alarming than the money they spend on it. The study found that third-party campaigners also resorted to using Islamophobic language and derogatory slurs in their political advertisements. This contrasts sharply with the content of political advertisements posted by the official parties on Google, which, while critical, generally refrained from such inflammatory rhetoric. The proliferation of such content by third-party actors not only distorts the democratic discourse but also raises ethical and regulatory questions about the role of these entities in electoral processes. These entities blur the fine line between persuasion and manipulation, casting a shadow over the integrity of democratic engagement. Explained | Why 2024 could be the \u2018make-or-break\u2019 year for democracy This discussion points to three major issues that are emerging in the realm of digital campaigning that demand urgent attention: regulation of expenditure; content oversight, and the challenges posed by platformisation. First, the disparity in financial resources among political parties is manifested by their digital advertisement spending, particularly on platforms such as Google. Wealthier parties can dominate the digital landscape, creating an uneven playing field for existing and emerging players. This highlights the urgent need for \u2018segmented caps\u2019 on party expenditure, which would not only limit overall spending but also ensure balanced allocation across various campaign categories, such as digital campaigns and rallies.. Second, content regulation is brought into focus by the role of third-party campaigners. There must be strict expenditure reporting requirements for these non-contestants, similar to practices in the United Kingdom and Canada. Additionally, an independent agency should conduct an audit of their content after each election cycle to balance the right to free speech with the need for effective oversight. This audit would go beyond the current role of the Media Certification and Monitoring Committee (MCMC), which has proven to be less than ideal. Lastly, platformisation has led to varied content strategies across digital platforms. For instance, on Google, political advertisements by parties and third-party campaigners typically avoid overtly derogatory content, and there was no significant spending by third-party campaigners. In contrast, on Meta, a large number of third-party campaigners were among the top spenders, often featuring inflammatory or problematic content in their political advertisements. This disparity highlights the need for uniform, harmonised regulatory frameworks to tackle problematic digital content across platforms, which will also ensure that all tech giants are held to the same standards of accountability. Also Read | Radical democracy: why is it still relevant today? Need for reforms In the digital age, the rules of the game have changed, but the rulebook remains stuck in the past, leaving regulatory loopholes and shortcomings. The task before us is to navigate this complex terrain, ensuring that technology serves to enhance, rather than erode, the democratic ideals that we hold dear. This can only be achieved through comprehensive studies in India\u2019s context, particularly in the emerging field of digital campaigning. To come up with robust solutions, we must move beyond the constraints of traditional political theories and build a body of literature that unravels the layers of the digital realm. International Day of Democracy, celebrated globally on September 15 each year, has passed, but it is crucial to push for reforms that expand the definition of rule of law to encompass the digital realm. This expansion can ultimately bring the value of delight to our democracy by forging effective regulations in the domain of the digital.

            "content": "Kanhaiya Kumar was campaigning for AICC general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir, who is the party's candidate in the upcoming J&K Assembly polls from the Dooru seat. Jammu And Kashmir Elections: As Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir are inching closer, political parties are stepping up their poll campaign in the Union Territory. On Sunday, Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who was campaigning in Anantnag, said that there is a silence in Jammu and Kashmir and actual peace would be established when his party will come to power. Speaking to PTI Videos during poll campaigning in Anantnag, he said, \"There is a difference between silence and peace. There is silence here. We have to bring actual peace\". Kumar was campaigning for All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir, who is the party's candidate in the upcoming J&K Assembly polls from the Dooru seat. He said there is \"a huge anger against the oppression\" that the people of the Union Territory have been subjected to over the last 10 years. \"Our understanding is that this time, the voting percentage in Kashmir will be the highest. This voting will be against oppression, unemployment, the injustices done to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and to get back their right to statehood,\" he said. The Congress leader also took a pot shot at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government and accused it of harbouring \"ill intentions.\" He dubbed the independent candidates in the elections \"slaves of Union Minister Amit Shah.\" \"Those who are contesting the polls as independents are actually slaves of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. That is why the election in Jammu and Kashmir this time is a fight between two powers\u2014on the one hand, there are those who spread hatred, and on the other, there are those who spread love and fight for the rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir,\" he said. Kumar said the election is a battle between two ideologies, with the National Conference-Congress coalition on the one hand and the alliance of all others, \"which is essentially the BJP's alliance,\" on the other. \"This fight is between love and hate, between justice and injustice. It is a fight for giving back the people of Jammu and Kashmir their rights, which were snatched from them. People here have understood that they must not allow a division of votes,\" he said. The 90-member Jammu and Kashmir Assembly is set to go to polls in three phases on September 18, September 25, and October 1, and the counting of votes will be taken up on October 8.

            "description": "Each District Mineral Foundation embodies cooperative federalism and is an example of how economic growth is being balanced with local welfare and rights",
            "content": "In the year 2014, the higher judiciary turned the spotlight on the allotment of coal blocks with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India\u2019s report of 2012 focusing on the allocation of coal blocks between 2004 and 2009. In 2015, the Narendra Modi government amended the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act mandating auctions. As a part of the Bill, the government created a new body in the form of a District Mineral Foundation (DMF) where licensees and leaseholders pay the DMF a certain amount of the royalty. This was driven by the Prime Minister\u2019s firm belief that local communities are the key stakeholders in the nation\u2019s natural resource-led development. Explained | How does the Mines and Mineral Bill 2023 plan to bring the private sector into mineral exploration? A transformation Today, ten years later, the DMF has received a corpus of almost \u20b91 lakh crore through which decentralised community-centric development works are carried out in mining affected districts. The journey from huge losses in crores to the national exchequer to an almost \u20b91 lakh crore corpus in the DMF is a transformation worth narrating. September 16 is District Mineral Foundation Day as the Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana (PMKKKY) scheme enters its tenth year. Today, the DMFs have resulted in three lakh projects being sanctioned across 645 districts in 23 States, transforming mineral wealth into a lifeline for development in mining affected regions. The objective in the PMKKKY is to implement developmental and welfare projects/programmes in mining affected areas alongside existing schemes/projects of State and central governments; minimising the impacts of mining on the people in mining districts and ensuring that those affected have long-term sustainable livelihoods. At a recent DMF Gallery launch in New Delhi, I had the privilege of meeting some talented women from self-help groups set up by DMFs in Odisha. These women were not just artisans but were also entrepreneurs in the making. In Katni, Madhya Pradesh, DMFs are helping young minds master drone technology. Many have landed jobs and others are gearing up for new opportunities. In India\u2019s rapidly evolving mining landscape, where we have just launched the National Critical Minerals Mission to secure our footing in strategic and critical minerals and are expanding our global footprint through our international public sector unit, Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. (KABIL), DMFs complement this goal through the welfare of the local communities in mining areas. DMFs institutionalise this strategy by making State governments active partners and stand as a veritable picture of the philosophy of \u2018Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas Sabka Vishwas Sabka Prayas\u2019. With a District Collector at the helm, funds flow to where the needs are greatest. The \u2018National DMF Portal\u2019 digitises the administration and the oversight of DMFs across India, enabling greater transparency and efficiency in operations. DMFs are not only spearheading national priorities but also supplementing efforts of the district administration in improving the socio-economic and human development indicators of the region. OPINION | Africa can make India\u2019s \u2018critical mineral mission\u2019 shine Innovation at every DMF It is also interesting to note how every DMF is innovating to maximise the impact of the initiatives and devising strategies to address unique challenges and needs. For instance, some DMFs are ensuring inclusivity by including elected representatives in the governing bodies while some have non-elected members of gram sabhas as well. Some DMFs have also adopted measures such as establishing a dedicated engineering department and deputing personnel from the State Public Works Department to ensure the efficient implementation of projects. Ensuring a well-planned outlook, DMFs are also chalking out a three-year-plan to ensure targeted goal achievement. After studying these various models, our aim now is to ensure that such best practices are standardised across all DMFs without taking away the local context and knowledge that resides within the district. These efforts will ensure that DMFs take up long-term and well-planned projects while avoiding the earlier fragmented approach. To further integrate DMFs operations, we are encouraging district administrations to dovetail the activities and goals of the DMFs with ongoing central and State schemes in aspirational districts and supplement efforts towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We are also aiming to use DMFs to augment the livelihood of forest dwellers by taking up projects in the plantation, collection and processing of medicinal herbs. The DMFs will also identify and nurture rural athletes while developing sports infrastructure and facilities. DMFs, in short, can be seen as microcosms of the government\u2019s \u2018whole of government\u2019 approach, and will continue to be leveraged to reach out to the impacted communities Advantage of convergence The DMFs are a fine example of cooperative federalism and have the unique advantage of converging central and State schemes. Aligning goals and resources at three levels of governance ensures that national priorities meet local needs and amplify the impact and reach. Moving forward with a \u2018whole of government\u2019 approach, DMFs are becoming powerful tools for truly inclusive governance, reaching every corner of the nation. By tapping into India\u2019s mineral wealth, these initiatives are transforming historically underserved regions, turning natural resources into drivers of local development. Beyond just empowering marginalised communities, India is reshaping how the world thinks about resource management, setting an example of how nations must balance economic growth with social welfare and rights.

Targeting the Chief Minister, BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said, \u201cArvind Kejriwal has done a PhD on how to make a virtue out of necessity.\u201d The BJP leader said the top court did not acquit him in the excise policy case and instead granted him conditional bail that turned him into a \u201cceremonial Minister\u201d. Commenting on the CM\u2019s demand for an early Assembly poll, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said had he wanted it, he would have called for a Cabinet meeting to recommend the dissolution of the Assembly. \u201cWhen Arvind Kejriwal talked about resigning, it became a confession of his crime. He accepted that the charges levelled against him were such that he could not continue as Chief Minister,\u201d he added. Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva also dared Mr. Kejriwal to resign immediately along with his Cabinet while expressing apprehensions about his decision to quit. \u2018He may make U-turn\u2019 \u201cThe people of Delhi doubt that Kejriwal will resign, and his past actions and U-turns cast doubt on his announcement,\u201d Mr. Sachdeva said adding that after two days, the CM might say that MLAs \u201cwant him to continue\u201d on his post. Accusing the CM of corruption, Mr. Sachdeva said people are now seeking an account of crores of rupees spent on the renovation of his official residence. \u201cIf Kejriwal is so honest, he should open his \u2018sheesh mahal\u2019 to the public and media and show where all the funds came from,\u201d Mr. Sachdeva said, adding that BJP workers will go door to door to expose the corruption of his government.

He said Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s announcement was a \u201cpolitical drama\u201d as the Supreme Court had put several restrictions on him while granting him conditional bail. \u201cA new CM should be appointed as soon as possible,\u201d he said, adding that people would give a befitting reply to AAP in the Assembly poll scheduled for February next year.

            "content": "Delhi\u2019s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday claimed that Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s decision to quit as the Chief Minister to face the \u201ctrial by fire in people\u2019s court\u201d has set high standards of morality in Indian politics as an honest leader like him can\u2019t bear false accusations of corruption. \u201cImagine what would have such a person gone through after being accused of corruption. Such a person would not have been able to sleep while constantly thinking about people\u2019s views for whom he is working?\u201d said Delhi Finance Minister Atishi. \u2018Sunita not in race\u2019 She also junked suggestions that Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s wife Sunita might be assuming the CM\u2019s role, saying that the allegations stem from the BJP\u2019s \u201cfrustration\u201d as it could not \u201cbreak\u201d her party despite their leaders\u2019 arrest by Central probe agencies in fake corruption cases. She also sought to dispel doubts about the CM\u2019s decision to put in his papers only after two days, saying, \u201cThe decision was taken simply because today is Sunday and tomorrow is a public holiday. So, the next working day is Tuesday\u201d. When asked why AAP did not choose to dissolve the Assembly if the CM wants early poll, Ms. Atishi said the Election Commission could call poll anytime as the present Assembly\u2019s tenure is set to end in less than six months now. Urban Development Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj too hailed Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s decision to step down from the CM post \u201cuntil he proves his honesty before the people with an agnipariksha (trial by fire)\u201d. \u201cHe is jeopardising his entire career and going to the people\u2019s court. This is unique to him,\u201d he added. Frontrunners for post Both Ms. Atishi and Mr. Bharadwaj also requested the poll panel to conduct the Delhi Assembly election along with Maharashtra in November so that people could \u201cput their stamp on Kejriwal\u2019s honesty\u201d. However, both Ministers did not comment on who will be assuming the CM\u2019s role after Mr. Kejriwal quits, amid speculations of both being frontrunners for the post. Sources in the party, however, said Ms. Atishi could be Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s choice for the position as she is handling most number of departments.

            "content": "Gabriel Magalhaes' second-half header earned Arsenal a crucial 1-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur in a feisty north London derby on Sunday (September 15, 2024) to keep pace with early Premier League leaders Manchester City. Spurs started sharper and David Raya was forced into early saves, turning Dejan Kulusevski's first-time effort behind before he clawed away a dangerous cross from the Sweden winger. Record signing Dominic Solanke, making his home debut, squandered a good opening in the 14th minute after Arsenal lost possession deep in their own half, taking too long on the ball and allowing William Saliba to recover. Arsenal fought their way into the contest, with Guglielmo Vicario tested by a Kai Havertz header before Gabriel Martinelli scuffed his shot with Bukayo Saka waiting centrally. Jurrien Timber was perhaps fortunate to avoid a straight red card in the first half for a reckless challenge on Pedro Porro as he tried to retain possession. His studs landed on Porro's ankle but referee Jarred Gillett deemed the incident was not serious foul play and VAR declined to intervene, much to the Spurs fans' anger. The second half started in similar fashion to the first, with the hosts on top as Micky van de Ven tested Raya with a glancing header, before Arsenal again got a foothold in the game. The game had been breathless but low on quality in front of goal until Arsenal punished Spurs from a corner, having done so twice in last season's 3-2 away win in April. Gabriel escaped far too easily from Cristian Romero, who pleaded for a foul in vain, and powered a header past Vicario from close range in the 64th minute. Arsenal withstood some late pressure from Spurs, who created few real chances and were left shooting from range as the Gunners seemed happy with a one-goal lead. The win, their third in a row away to their bitter rivals, puts Arsenal on 10 points from four games, two behind champions Manchester City ahead of their trip to the Etihad next Sunday. Spurs, once again left to rue missed chances, have four points from four games. Published - September 16, 2024 01:12 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit soccer",

DEEPAK Inaugurated in 2005, the facility is the first in the country to serve the tribals of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) of Paderu, Rampachodavaram, Parvathipuram, Chintoor and Seethampeta agencies along the Eastern Ghats and in the coastal districts along the Bay of Bengal. When The Hindu enquired on September 14, 2024, a total of 208 tribals were taking treatments in the hospital beds, for various health problems ranging from cancer, gynaecological, paediatric, fevers and some other accidental cases like burns, road accidents etc. As per the statistical data of 12-month period (from July 2023 to June 2024), the total number of outpatients was 4,112, in patients (5,757), deaths (759), emergency medical services (833), laboratory diagnostic services (560), blood bank services (355) and mortuary services (403). It is located next to the Casualty Ward in the Main Outpatient Building, while entering through the OP Gate of KGH. It was an initiative of the then ITDA Paderu in erstwhile Visakhapatnam district for the treatment of tribals of remote villages. Later, it received appreciation from the public and governments, and continued its service by frequently upgrading the quality of its facilities and services. \u201cThe aim of the Tribal Cell is to reduce the fear and anxiety in the tribals and persuade them to get treatment in hospitals, limit the difficulties due to lack of knowledge and language, and provide access to high specialised care available in cities like Visakhapatnam or refer them to other metros if needed. It also helps Andhra Medical College students and faculty for research studies as tribals suffer from rare diseases like sickle cell anaemia due to their habitat. According to my knowledge, I can say that no State in the country has such a huge and dedicated Tribal Cell to cater to the needs of five ITDAs,\u201d the Tribal Cell Chief Coordinator A.P.V.V.S.M. Sampath told The Hindu . Dr. Sampath further said that most people from doctors to support staff know the tribal language as some of them were born in tribal areas, studied medical courses and worked in tribal areas. They have been deployed here for service for some time on rotational basis. The staff are fully authorised by Alluri Sitharama Raaju district, where they are paid, but work in the Cell located in the City. Tribal Cell works 24x7 and provides emergency medicines free of cost that ranges from \u20b91,500 to \u20b92,000. It also provides laboratory diagnostic services, blood, counselling, hearse van services for dead patients from the mortuary to home. Three hearses are available at present. Services are in three shifts (8 a.m. to 2 p.m., 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. and 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.). The staff change shifts every 10 days. ASR District Medical Officer Jamal Basha said, \u201cThis facility is one of the big assets for agency districts and ITDAs to provide prompt and quality services in emergencies like in the recent case of food poisoning of children. We can say that it is a role model for other States.\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 12:47 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "description": "Kejriwal bail order is a reminder to CBI to dispel perception of bias",
            "content": "A two-member Bench of the Supreme Court that granted bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi excise policy case was divided on the legality of his arrest by the CBI on corruption charges soon after he was given regular bail in connection with money-laundering charges. After the benefit was given to the co-accused, including Delhi\u2019s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Bharat Rashtra Samithi leader K. Kavitha , under the more stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act, it was only a matter of time before Mr. Kejriwal was also released on conditional bail. Justice Surya Kant and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan were one in holding that he was entitled to bail and that there was no need, as the CBI wanted, to send him back to the trial court. However, while Justice Kant found no violation of procedure in his arrest, as the CBI had approached the trial court for permission to question Mr. Kejriwal and, later on, to arrest him, Justice Bhuyan bluntly observed that the timing of his arrest was \u201csuspect\u201d. Noting that the CBI did not feel the need to arrest him for 22 months, he questioned the urgency to arrest him \u201cwhen he was on the cusp of release in the ED (Enforcement Directorate) case\u201d. Justice Bhuyan also recalled precedents that say the existence of the power to arrest did not necessarily mean that there was a need to arrest. Justice Bhuyan\u2019s observations also touched upon the CBI\u2019s reputation. Few would disagree with the view that the CBI should strive to dispel the notion that it is \u201c a caged parrot \u201d, and that its investigation should not give the impression that it probes cases and arrests people in a high-handed and biased manner. The judge has rightly emphasised the right of the accused to remain silent, and decried the propensity among investigating agencies to cite \u201cnon-cooperation\u201d or \u201cevasive answers\u201d during questioning as a ground to keep suspects in prison. If the order of bail in the Manish Sisodia case was a reminder to all judges that bail cannot be denied as a matter of punishment, Justice Bhuyan\u2019s separate judgment will be notable for its reminder to the CBI about its obligation to keep its investigations fair. There is also some subtle criticism of the Delhi High Court\u2019s order rejecting bail to Mr. Kejriwal on the ground that he ought to approach the trial court first. Both judges noted that the High Court should have considered bail on merits, if it had not asked the petitioner at the threshold itself to approach the lower court, with one of them observing that the delay in issuing notice and hearing the matter at length resulted only in prolonging his incarceration.

            "content": "In a rare, direct comment against the VCK, PMK president Anbumani Ramadoss on Sunday criticised the party\u2019s president, Thol. Thirumavalavan, for consistently labelling the PMK as a \u201ccaste-based\u201d party. Dr. Anbumani\u2019s remark comes in the wake of the VCK chief\u2019s statement that he would not invite the PMK and the BJP for a rally on prohibition in Kallakurichi district on October 2. The PMK has undertaken several protests for social justice, and against liquor in Tamil Nadu, Dr. Anbumani recalled. Addressing reporters in Sivakasi, he said the DMK, the AIADMK, and the VCK, among others, had taken up liquor prohibition as an \u201cideological stand\u201d only because the PMK had been campaigning against alcohol since the party was formed. \u201cSix or seven years ago, the Dravidian parties refused to even speak about prohibition. We welcome anyone who holds a rally for prohibition. About 15,000 women in the PMK have gone to jail, protesting against liquor. This is our history. The VCK should not call the PMK a caste-based party. We [the PMK] are the ones talking about water management, agriculture, and education. We have even brought in changes without being in power,\u201d he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan should join hands with the PMK in the protest against liquor as the Vanniyar and the Scheduled Caste communities are the most affected by it, Dr. Anbumani added. He further said, \u201cHe [Mr. Thirumavalavan] should call DMK MP Kanimozhi, who was talking about prohibition until three years ago, to the rally and urge her to inform her brother [Chief Minister M.K. Stalin] that the situation was bad in Tamil Nadu. The State has the highest number of young widows; witnesses the highest number of road accidents; and has mental health issues. Only after the Kallakurichi [hooch] tragedy, he has realised the gravity of the problem. The PMK has done a PhD in this issue, whereas Mr. Thirumavalavan has just started in LKG,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, VCK general secretary D. Ravikumar has said that it was not Mr. Thirumavalavan\u2019s intention to insult or label the PMK as a \u201ccaste-based\u201d party. However, the VCK, he said, was merely explaining the context in which it was refusing to work with the PMK for prohibition. \u201cDuring the Vanniyar protests in 1987 over reservation, the huts of SCs were burnt. In the 1999 Parliamentary election, we again faced violence. Yet, between 2004 and 2009, we worked with the PMK in the Tamil Padhukappu Iyakkam. Despite being in different alliances after 2009, we were together when it came to the Tamil Eelam issue. When Dr. Ramadoss unveiled a number of Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s statues and helped bury the body of a Dalit, we recognised his work by giving him the title of Tamil Kudithaangi,\u201d he recalled. However, things changed after the 2011 Assembly election, he said. \u201cDuring the death of Ilavarasan, and the Dharmapuri violence [attack on Dalit neighbourhood in Naickenkottai after a Dalit youth fell in love with a Vanniyar girl] unfolded, Mr. Thirumavalavan was in London. However, before he could return, the VCK was accused of Nadaka Kadhal [staged love affairs], and it [the PMK] started pursuing hate politics. It was only after this incident that we decided not to work with them again,\u201d he added. He further said, \u201cIf it [the PMK] is truly interested in peace, it should come forward to remove the venom it has instilled in society...\u201d Published - September 16, 2024 12:40 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "description": "India\u2019s efforts at peacemaking between Russia and Ukraine have limited potential",
            "content": "National Security Adviser Ajit Doval\u2019s visit to Russia had outcomes of potential bilateral and geopolitical consequence. At the meet of high-level security officials of the BRICS grouping, his one-on-one meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin , and Chinese Foreign Minister and senior Chinese Communist Party Politburo official Wang Yi were in the spotlight as well. The meet of BRICS NSAs came ahead of the BRICS summit in October which will bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the leaders of Brazil, South Africa, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia together for the first time since the grouping was expanded in 2023. The Doval-Wang meeting was no less important, given that the two high-level officials were meeting in the wake of intensified India-China contact to resolve the four-year-old military standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Their decision to \u201credouble their efforts\u201d with \u201curgency\u201d to complete disengagement along the LAC indicates that they hope to make progress in time before a possible Modi-Xi meet at the BRICS summit. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar\u2019s comment that 75% of the disengagement has been completed seems to point to the government\u2019s determination to cease hostilities with China, albeit not one that would actually see a reversion to the situation at the LAC prior to 2020. Finally, there was Mr. Doval\u2019s meeting with Mr. Putin, which was a rare protocol exception. Mr. Doval\u2019s comments, that he had been sent by Mr. Modi to brief Mr. Putin \u201cpersonally\u201d about the Modi Ukraine visit could mean that India is essaying a more mediatory role in peace-making. If the government is indeed serious about such a role, it must be clear about what it entails. While officials have frequently said India has \u201cconveyed messages\u201d between Russia, Ukraine , and western countries during the war, mediating will require India to expend considerable goodwill, time and patience to achieve results. Tu\u0308rkiye, Indonesia and Hungary have been speaking to both sides since the 2022 invasion, and there are now many peace proposals from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Mr. Putin, the Bu\u0308rgenstock Communique\u0301, and even a six-point proposal by Brazil and China. The conflict is far from stable with ominous signs of an escalation including Ukraine\u2019s invasion of Kursk, Russian missile strikes, and Mr. Zelenskyy\u2019s persistent demand to be allowed to carry out long-range strikes on Russia using American and British hardware. Mr. Modi\u2019s travel to the U.S. this month for UN meetings, the Quad Summit and another meeting with Mr. Zelenskyy possibly, followed by his visit to Russia for the BRICS summit will carry much responsibility, but India\u2019s efforts at peacemaking must not be over-burdened by unrealistic expectations.

Revanth Reddy of spreading \u201clies\u201d and neglecting the plight of farmers in the State while alleging that the latter was disregarding the \u201cdignity of the office\u201d with inappropriate language . Addressing a press conference at Telangana Bhavan on Sunday, Mr. Rao pointed out that, despite occupying the Chief Minister\u2019s chair, Mr. Revanth Reddy has failed to demonstrate the responsibility that the position demands. \u201cRecently, you called for respect for your office, but how can anyone respect a leader who has so consistently disrespected the people and the very chair he sits on,\u201d he asked. Mr. Harish Rao also touched on the continuous personal attacks directed at him concerning his height, remarking, \u201cYes, I am tall like a palm tree, but you (CM) keep harping on my height because your mind, history, and language are all short.\u201d Alleging that the Revanth Reddy government had failed to waive crop loan for all farmers, he claimed that it had contributed to a rise in farmer suicides. Referring to the case of Surender Reddy, a farmer who reportedly took his life due to unresolved crop loans, Mr. Rao accused the Chief Minister of making false claims about loan waivers. \u201cYou claim to have waived the loans, but can you prove it? Why did Surender Reddy end his life if the loans were truly waived?\u201d He challenged the State government to provide evidence that the promised loan waiver exceeding \u20b92 lakh had been implemented. \u201cOf the promised \u20b931,000 crore, not even half \u2014 \u20b917,000 crores \u2014 has been delivered. Of the 40 lakh eligible farmers, only 20 lakh have benefited from the waiver,\u201d Mr. Rao alleged. He said that he would keep raising the issue until crop loan is waived for all farmers Published - September 16, 2024 12:35 am IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "Telangana BJP president and Union Minister for Coal and Mines G. Kishan Reddy has questioned the \u201cintent\u201d of Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy in celebrating the proposed \u2018Praja Palana Dinostavam\u2019 (People\u2019s Governance Day) on September 17 and charged it is to \u201cdeflect\u201d the attention of the people from the core aspects of the \u2018Hyderabad Liberation\u2019 struggle. While thanking the Chief Minister for the invitation extended to him to participate in the State government function, Mr. Kishan Reddy, in a letter, addressed to the former declined the same and said he cannot be party to an \u201cinsincere ritual which blatantly attempts to erase the truth from the people\u201d. The BJP leader claimed that to \u201cdescribe the Liberation of Hyderabad, as just another transition of power from a monarchy to a democracy not only subverts the heroic struggle but also propagates further the politics of appeasement\u201d. Mr. Revanth Reddy as the \u201cson of this very soil\u201d is well aware that the people of Hyderabad \u2018Samsthan\u2019 had sustained a spirited struggle for years to liberate the region from the brutalities of the Nizam and his private army of Razakars where many people laid down their lives in the process and thousands withstood unfathomable violence, he said. The liberation of Telangana is a heart-wrenching story of courage, sacrifice and martyrdom. Therefore, there is a need to commemorate September 17 in a manner that befits the sacrifice of the martyrs. The purpose of such a commemoration ought to inspire the present generations with patriotic and nationalist fervour, and by informing them of the pristine history of the liberation, said Mr. Kishan Reddy. Therefore, the Narendra Modi government had, over the last few years, given the day its due in a \u201cform and manner that pays homage to the courage, sacrifice and valour of those who made the liberation possible\u201d. Acknowledging September 17 as a day of immense significance is the first step to eventually understand and accept the truth of liberation, he added.

            "description": "The news comes roughly two months after the Republican presidential nominee was shot during an assassination attempt",
            "content": "Donald Trump's campaign says he is safe after gunshots were reported in his vicinity Sunday (September 15, 2024) afternoon in Florida, his campaign and the Secret Service said. It was not immediately clear whether the reported shots were targeted at the Republican presidential nominee. The US Secret Service said it was investigating and that the incident occurred shortly before 2 pm. \u201cThe former president is safe,\u201d according to the Secret Service. Roughly two months ago, Trump was shot during an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania, and a bullet grazed his ear. Trump had returned to Florida this weekend from a West Coast swing that included a Friday night rally in Las Vegas and a Utah fundraiser. The campaign did not immediately provide any additional details. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation said officials were trying to determine whether the shots were fired near Trump\u2019s West Palm Beach golf course or on the grounds. The official was not authorised to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Trump often spends the morning playing golf, before having lunch at the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, which is one of three he owns in the state. Trump has had a stepped-up security footprint since the assassination attempt in July. When he has been at Trump Tower in New York, a lineup of dump trucks have parked in a wall outside the building. And at outdoor rallies, he now speaks from behind an enclosure of bulletproof glass. A message sent to campaign officials seeking information on the security status and location of Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, was not immediately returned.. Campaign communications director Steven Cheung says Trump was safe.

The government\u2019s duplicity as far as the other languages of India are concerned is there for all to see. To have the Union Home Minister say with pride that \u201cHindi should be generally accepted as the language of work with consensus\u201d contradicts the provisions of the Official Languages Act on the continuation of English and the subject of the non-Hindi speaker. Why this contradiction and posturing? V. Padmanabhan, Bengaluru Buch\u2019s \u2018investments\u2019 A critical question that arises out of the \u2018decision\u2019 by SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch to \u201cinvest in Chinese funds\u201d (\u2018Business\u2019 page, September 15) is about whether it was a strategic financial decision or just a geopolitical one. The idea behind diversification is in reducing the risks associated with investing. However, the allegation that the Congress party has levelled raises more questions. Garima Singh, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh Focus on jute It is apt to popularise replacing plastic with jute as packaging material, especially as India has emerged as the \u2018world\u2019s top plastic polluter\u2019. The government should be firm in making it mandatory to use jute, except where plastic is not replaceable. The quality of jute produced in Assam is good and has some ideal properties (\u2018In Frames: Jute \u2014 the golden fibre\u2019, September 15). Devashis Bose, Chabua, Assam Comments on GST An innocuous comment by a renowned businessman and hotelier based in Coimbatore to put the issue of GST in perspective has been taken to be \u2018offensive\u2019. It is shocking that the comments made by the gentleman were not taken in the right perspective as is expected in a democracy. What is wrong with Indian democracy? T.

            "description": "India sees challenges as either rural or urban; instead, it needs to address them as part of a continuum",
            "content": "T his century is supposed to be India\u2019s urban century due not only to massive demographic shifts, with the country soon becoming more urban than rural, but also to the demand for the infrastructure required to support these large shifts. These demographic changes are occurring in Tier II and Tier III cities, as well as the peripheries of major urban centres and urban agglomerations. India addresses challenges by viewing them as either rural or urban; it needs to instead look at them as part of an urban-rural continuum. OPINION | Reimagining the urban-rural dichotomy Current policy framework There has been an over-centralisation of finances in recent times. Financial decentralisation, which provides autonomy to local bodies, has been compromised. The 13th Finance Commission pointed out this issue by mentioning how local bodies were getting \u201casphyxiated\u201d. Some of these financial constraints arise from the tied nature of grants linked to centrally sponsored schemes and even financial devolution. For example, the rise in property tax in cities should be commensurate with the rise in the State Goods and Services Tax. If there is no linkage, most towns are at risk of losing tied money grants, which have increased relative to untied grants over the years. OPINION | A new sense of urbanisation that is dominating Flagship programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Mission and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), launched by successive National Democratic Alliance governments at the Centre, miss the urban-rural continuum. As far as urban infrastructure for liquid waste management is concerned, funding is proposed under AMRUT, which initially covered 500 cities but has now been extended to all statutory towns. However, these towns account for only a portion of the urban population. Many people live in census towns (with a minomum population of 5,000) and in the more than 23,000 urban villages. These areas are contiguous, with census towns adjoining statutory towns, and urban villages accommodating large numbers of migrant and informal workers. When urban infrastructure for liquid waste, such as sewage treatment plants, is designed, and funding is sought under AMRUT, these contiguous areas do not qualify for funding. The waste flow in cities and peri-urban areas does not adhere to urban-rural nomenclature, yet the planning process is obsessed with it. This issue has been a challenge for many States, particularly Kerala. NITI Aayog has pointed out that 90% of Kerala is urban. In such a situation, AMRUT grants cannot be utilised to create infrastructure. AMRUT also does not support solid waste management infrastructure in urban areas. This falls under the Swachh Bharat Mission, which is now Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0. The goals of the Mission are twofold. For Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban, the aim is to go beyond being open defecation-free to focusing on making urban India garbage-free and proposing sustainable solutions and practices for waste management. Similarly, Swachh Bharat Mission-Rural focuses on maintaining the open defecation-free status, managing solid and liquid waste in rural India, and constructing household toilets. It also addresses liquid waste management, which Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban does; however, treatment plants cannot be built jointly. Both these programmes, run by the Government of India, aim for nearly the same outcomes, so realising these through imaginative practices could yield better results. Solid waste management plants in peri-urban and urban areas could be designed collaboratively at the district or regional levels. Such liberty and autonomy will pave the way for better urban governance, rather than implementing programmes and projects from a centralised perspective. OPINION | Turn off the tap of urban bias in rural development Governance models In this context, the the framework established by the 73rd and 74th Constitution Amendments needs to be revisited and strengthened. It appears that three decades ago, there was more imaginative thinking in addressing such challenges than there is now. Under this framework, District Planning Committees comprising the Zila Panchayats and urban local bodies need to be strengthened and mobilised. While the intended governance model envisioned the district bureaucracy being subordinate to the District Planning Committees, at present, in most States, the District Planning Committees have become appendages of the district bureaucracy. Stronger District Planning Committees can help address the challenge of a urban-rural continuum. During a conversation with the Minister for Local Self-Governments in Kerala, I learned that a proposed solid waste landfill site in the periphery of a town had to be withdrawn due to public pressure. This was possible only because both rural and urban local bodies fall under the same Ministry. In other States, this would have taken much longer. Thus, the urban and rural continuum in rapidly expanding urban areas needs urgent interventions at both the infrastructure and governance levels. The previous models of separate urban and rural local bodies need to be updated in today\u2019s India, which is fast becoming urban. We need to question why finances and resources are provided in such a compartmentalised manner to urban and rural India, when the lines between the two are blurred. There must at least be some liberty in imaginatively designing plans in a joint manner. Tikender Singh Panwar Former deputy mayor, Shimla, and Member, Kerala Urban Commission.

            "description": "The areca growers in Karnataka are facing a series of problems",
            "content": "A reca growers in Karnataka experienced a rude shock recently when traders in north India rejected truckloads of their produce, citing poor quality. This hit the areca price in the market by nearly \u20b910,000 per quintal. The growers, who were expecting returns up to \u20b958,000 per quintal, are now selling their produce for around \u20b947,000 per quintal. Karnataka is the largest areca-growing State. The demand for nuts, particularly from the hilly Malnad region, is traditionally highest in north India, particularly in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The agriculture economy of many districts in the Malnad region and central Karnataka depend on areca cultivation. When the produce was rejected, co-operative bodies of areca marketing in the Malnad region appealed to both the growers and traders to prioritise quality. The rejections have led to a war of words between the growers and traders. The growers blame the traders. They allege that the traders mix different varieties of nuts and send loads of these to buyers in north India in the hope of higher returns. Areca nuts are categorised as Nuli, Hasa, Rashi, Bette and Gorabalu depending on their look and feel, the experience of biting into them, their aroma, and so on. Nuli and Hasa are top quality nuts and are highly valued. Gorablu is of inferior quality. According to marketing bodies, a few traders mixed Gorablu with Rashi and Bette. A truckload normally consists of 330 bags of nuts, each weighing some 70 kg. Farmers allege that traders mixed around 100 bags of Gorablu nuts with Rashi to make quick money. As several truckloads of nuts have been rejected in recent months, the demand for areca nuts fell and the prices crashed. The growers maintain that they are suffering for no fault of theirs: they sell their produce to middleman, who in turn make a deal with traders. They allege that low quality nuts were mixed with better quality ones after the nuts were sold to middlemen. Meanwhile, according to the traders, a handful of farmers have begun using chemicals during the processing of nuts to enhance the look and feel of inferior-quality nuts. Processing involves removing the husk and boiling the kernels. While a majority of growers follow the traditional method of processing that does not involve chemicals, the traders say some have, which has landed them in trouble during quality checks. While these issues are being sorted out by local authorities, a section of growers believes that there is a larger reason why the nuts from Karnataka were rejected. They believe that inferior-quality areca is being illegally imported from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and other countries. The farmers have demanded that this stop. Office bearers at the Shivamogga district areca growers\u2019 association say the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court as well as Assam High Court have taken note of these illegal imports and the Centre should act to stop it. The issue of produce being rejected is only the latest in a series of problems that the areca growers are facing. In recent years, areca cultivation has been badly hit by fruit rot and yellow leaf disease. This year, following heavy rains in July and August, nearly 40% of the total areca plantation in Shivamogga district was affected by fungal disease. The situation in other areca growing areas is no better. The infection reduces the yield substantially, causing a huge loss to the farmers. The growers have been following the advice of experts from the Horticulture Department and scientists and are desperately trying to protect their palms from the disease. Vast tracts of areca plantations in Chikkamagaluru, Shivamogga, and Uttar Kannada districts have already been hit by yellow leaf disease. The yield in these plantations has come down by nearly 90%. A team of scientists from ICAR-Central Plantation Crops Research Institute at Kasargod, Kerala, visited the farms in Malnad region to examine them. Despite a series of protests and demands by the planters, no solution has been offered to them. Many growers, particularly those in the traditionally areca-growing regions of Thirthahalli, Hosanagara and Sagar in Shivamogga district and Sringeri, N.R. Pura, and Koppa in Chikkamagaluru district, are even moving to bigger cities, abandoning their farms. While some of these problems require detailed research, the traders and growers need to work together to solve the immediate problem of a drop in demand.

            "content": "Bangladesh on Sunday (September 15, 2024) sought assistance from the United States to implement the reform-related agenda of the interim government. Chief Adviser Prof Mohammed Yunus conveyed the requirements of the interim government to a multiagency delegation led by U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Finance and Development Brent Neiman and Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asia Donald Lu . Mr. Yunus briefed the visiting U.S. delegation about the prevailing scenario in Bangladesh since the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government fell following protests stemming from a student-people uprising. He said the interim government had constituted six commissions to reform various segments of the Bangladeshi state such as the judiciary, the police, the election commission and the constitution apart from launching an anti-corruption team. The visit is being keenly watched as it is the first high-level delegation from the U.S. visiting Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina, who was widely known to be critical of the U.S. administration. \u201cWe were submerged in an ocean of corruption,\u201d Mr. Yunus told the U.S. officials according to a readout issued by the BSS, the state-owned news outlet of Bangladesh. The hour-long meeting also covered the ongoing labour unrest in the country that has prompted the closure of a large number of garment factories in Bangladesh, the Rohingya crisis and the upcoming visit of Mr. Yunus to New York. The multi-agency team from the U.S. had stopped in New Delhi for bilateral consultation before reaching Dhaka on Saturday. The India visit of the Donald Lu-Brent Neiman delegation prompted some commentators to hint that the U.S. is probably aware of the Indian concerns in the aftermath of the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. This backdrop has prompted leading Bangladesh-watcher Jon Danilowicz to say in an article in Dhaka Tribune , \u201cIt will be important for the U.S. side to reassure their Bangladeshi counterparts that they are not singing off someone else\u2019s sheet music.\u201d The interim government has been critical of Sheikh Hasina residing in India where she took refuge after losing power. A major outcome of the visit was the signing of a deal between USAID and Bangladesh that will pave the way of grant for $200 million to Dhaka. \u201c@USAID signed an agreement worth $200 million with the Bangladesh interim government to advance development, empower youth, strengthen democracy and governmence, improve health and expand trade and economic opportunities to people across the country,\u201d said the USAID Bangladesh in a statement after the agreement. The deal was signed by Finance adviser Dr. Salehuddin Ahmed and Foreign Affairs Adviser Md. Touhid Hossain. Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin briefed the journalists and said that the discussion with the U.S. delegation covered all issues that fell in the domain of \u201cbilateral ties\u201d, indicating that India-Bangladesh ties did not feature in the talks. In response to a question about possible meeting between Mr. Yunus and U.S. President Joe Biden in New York, Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin said that a bilateral meeting was not yet on the cards but indicated that an interaction was possible as there are planned social events on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly\u2019s annual session. The interim government led by Mr. Yunus took charge on August 7 and has been focused on the law and order situation which has faced increased challenges recently. Apart from reports of attacks on the Awami League activists, violence has also targeted Islamic Sufi shrines.

            "content": "Travis Head's love affair of scoring runs against India is not a secret. The Aussie opener has broken the hearts of Indian fans with his knocks in the World Test Championship 2023 final and the ODI World Cup final as he played a pivotal role in his team's twin-title win. Head smashed a blistering 163 from 174 balls against the -led team in the WTC 2023 final, helping the team register a huge win of 209 runs. He displayed his big-match temperament against the Men in Blue again in the ODI World Cup 2023 final, scoring 137 from 120 deliveries while chasing 241 in the summit clash. However, Head has stated that he does not feel that India are his favourite opponents. \"I don't feel like they're my favourite. I just feel like we play them enough, play them (a) lot,\" he told Star Sports. \"And, I guess the last couple of years I've been in nice form. So yeah, being able to play well, it's always nice. It's not hard to get up for the contest. It's hugely competitive. Yeah, it's easier to get up for the game. So, I wouldn't say they're my favourite,\" he added. India are set to face Australia in a five-match Border-Gavaskar series Down Under in late 2024. Head feels that India will be a difficult opponent to play. \"They're extremely difficult but it's been nice to play well in a couple of games and looking forward to preparing well and being ready to go. And hopefully, I can contribute to what's a successful summer for us,\" he added. India have enjoyed success against Australia at the latter's home off late. India defeated the Aussies for the first time Down Under in the 2018-19 series under 's captaincy before doing a mind-boggling double over them under 's captaincy in 2020-21. They would need to pull off something special again to beat the Aussies for the third time and it is a no-brainer for the Men in Blue.",

The first 20-coach Vande Bharat train will run between Varanasi and Delhi, as per a PMO release. According to Western Railway officials, the Ahmedabad-Bhuj Vande Metro service will stop at nine stations and cover the 360-kilometre distance in 5 hours and 45 minutes at a top speed of 110 kilometres per hour. It will depart from Bhuj at 5:05 am and reach Ahmedabad Junction at 10:50 am, the officials had said. The prime minister will also inaugurate a 30 MW solar system, a 35 MW BESS Solar PV Project at Kutch Lignite Thermal Power Station, Kutch, and 220 Kilovolt substations at Morbi and Rajkot. PM Modi will launch the Single Window IT System (SWITS) of the International Financial Services Centres Authority, designed to streamline financial services. At the Ahmedabad event, PM Modi will also lay the foundation stone of projects concerning the quadrupling of the Samakhiali\u2013Gandhidham and Gandhidham\u2013Adipur railway lines, the development of iconic roads and the construction of flyovers in Ahmedabad city.

            "description": "Fifty-five Indian citizens\u2019 groups and a thousand individuals from across the globe have written a petition to the Chief Justice of India, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, Supreme Court of India, in the Kolkata RG Kar rape and murder case, asking for effective legal directives addressing sexual violence and police repression.",
            "content": "A thousand individuals and over 55 organisations such as South Asian Solidarity Collective, WAYVE Foundation, Lawyers Collective, CPI(M) and Adivasi Women\u2019s Network, have written an open letter to the Chief Justice of India D. Y. Chandrachud in the R.G. Kar rape and murder case on Sunday (September 15, 2024). The petition has mentioned nine demands, such as identification, arrest and exemplary punishment of the rapists and murderers. The Supreme Court must change the composition of the National Task Force (NTF) and include doctors, students, activists and lawyers from the regional fraternity for an effective and informed fact finding regarding the rape and murder of the trainee doctor and institutional lapses, corruption rackets in the health sector. The NTF needs to consult the protesting doctors, students and women, feminist organisations, and platforms who have been working on this issue and are significant stakeholders in this movement. Directive to institute a Special Fast Track Court, along with necessary infrastructure to expedite the trial processes, once the case is transferred to the Sessions Court in Bengal. Directives to penalise errant police officials, local party workers and anyone who launch physical assault on peaceful protesters and disrupt citizen assemblies in various parts of Bengal. The letter reads, \u201cAs feminist, student, mass organisations and individual citizens from across the country, along with Reclaim the Night, Reclaim the Rights [RTNRTR] Movement in West Bengal are dismayed that even after \u2018suo moto\u2019 cognizance of the R.G. Kar rape and murder by the SC, the case is at a standstill. The SC has failed to address the grievance, anger and rage of protesting people. A month has gone by, but the CBI is yet to reveal any findings of the gruesome rape and murder.\u201d The petitioners also raised concerns over the Supreme Court\u2019s remark in the last hearing and wrote, \u201cThe SC shifted its focus only to the protesting doctors as guilty [endorsed by Mr. Kapil Sibal] of the breakdown of the West Bengal health system. We want the SC to deliberate on the delayed investigations and purported protection of perpetrators, followed by attacks on citizen protests.\u201d The petitioners further stressed on the fact that the brutal rape and murder of the trainee doctor at R.G. Kar hospital is not an isolated incident but connected to different incidents of sexual violence and gender discrimination at workplace and in the public that have been rapidly increasing throughout the country. The group also pointed out at the failure of Prevention of Sexual Harassment [PoSH] Act at workplace. Concerns have been raised regarding the National Task Force instituted by SC in RG Kar to review the institutional safety standards of restroom, toilets, hostels, transport, sanitation etc. and address the vulnerability of medical professionals within healthcare institutions. \u201cThe perpetrators in this case have actively tried to cover up the crime, destroyed evidence and spread fear amidst students. While the CBI investigation has only till now led to the arrest of Sandip Ghosh and some of his accomplices, it is the pressure of the ongoing citizen protests that first, Sandip Ghosh was suspended and now 3 doctors of SSKM and North Bengal University are suspended,\u201d the petition read. Opposing the West Bengal government\u2019s Aparajita Women and Child Bill for stringent punishment in cases of sexual assault, the petition said, \u201cWe oppose the Aparajita Bill that has been produced by the TMC without any consultation with citizens. As feminists, we are opposed to capital punishment as it is a populist measure to quell public outrage and does not ensure the due process for women seeking justice.\u201d Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s order for no restrictions on peaceful protest on the very first day, the petitioners asked, \u201cWhat mechanisms the SC may adopt if protesters are threatened and imposed with false cases by police and local goons of political parties? It is ironic that instances of sexual violence and molestation are also being experienced by women, queer and transgender persons, who are independently protesting throughout West Bengal since August 14, 2024. There are daily reports from various districts of Bengal \u2013 where local goons of TMC and BJP attack protesters and disrupt protest sites. Police over-action, attack on peaceful assembly, illegal arrest and filing false cases on protesters is a recent experience in Barasat, North 24 Parganas. We firmly believe that the Right to Dissent is integral to democracy,\u201d the petition read.

            "content": "A new book to introduce children to the fascinating world of nature, including trees, birds, and wetlands, has been launched in the city. Launched by Tara Gandhi, conservationist and founder and life trustee of the Wildlife Trust of India, Be My Happy Place is a guidebook designed for middle schoolers to explore ecology and the environment through nature observation activities. Produced by Care Earth Trust in collaboration with SwedBio, a programme at Stockholm Resilience Centre that brings together experts from around the world on biodiversity and sustainable development, including local communities, the book is designed to bridge that gap by offering simple, engaging activities that students and teachers can do within the school campus and its surroundings to foster a deeper connection with nature. Seetha Gopalakrishnan, the author, said school curricula and textbooks often presented broad topics such as climate change and global warming, but they didn\u2019t always help children connect with the natural world or understand what was happening in it. Simple, but not too simplistic, this book would help students develop scientific rigour by engaging with nature through activities such as bird logs, she added. The book is divided into activities suited for four different environments \u2014 the campus, urban areas, wetlands, and coasts. The book was designed by Anisha Murali and Denver Pereira and illustrated by Tanvi Chunekar. The books will be distributed to four government schools in and around Chennai. Interested educators can contact Care Earth Trust to obtain copies of the activity sheets. Jayanthi M., Chairperson, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and Anwardeen I, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Project Director, Tamil Nadu Biodiversity Conservation and Greening Project for Climate Change Response, were present at the launch.

Staff of aided degree, junior colleges and schools, including lecturers, junior lecturers, teachers and non-teaching staff, are yet to receive salaries for the months of July and August, they said. Although the State government asserts its priority for payment of salaries in the first week of every month, the Association alleged that it was however not being realised. They further observed that a crisis-like situation would arise among teaching and non-teaching staff at several aided institutions if immediate intervention is not made. According to Surarapu Bixsham of the Association, Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy must direct an inquiry into delays in disbursal of salaries to teaching and non-teaching staffs in the past 10 years and lay down strict guidelines for timely payments. He said that about 5000 aided employees across colleges in the State were affected and waiting resoultion.

Whenever the supply was shut, Tangedco used to send SMS to the consumers. This service has been discontinued. When it can send SMS for tariff payment, what prevents Tangedco from sending SMS in case of an outage. V. Jayaraman, T. Nagar. Tangedco responds: A senior official of Tangedco reasons that SMS was sent in the past because the Minnagam service was not available. Now that the Minnagam call centre has been working round the clock, the service has been discontinued, he says. No last-mile link The suburban trains in the Beach-Tambaram-Chengalpattu section are the most popular and crowded. The absence of last-mile connectivity from the railway stations in the section to the core parts of the city causes hardship to residents. Nungambakkam is a prime area. However, the absence of last-mile connectivity through bus services means commuters must walk to the Sterling Road junction to board buses. We request the Metropolitan Transport Corporation to increase the frequency of small buses from Nungambakkam to DMS (S-36) at morning and evening peak hours. David Manohar, Chromepet.

            "description": "Starting out as an automobile parts trading company in 1929, it has grown to become a leading supplier of safety-critical automotive components. It reported a revenue of \u20b97,200 crore in fiscal 2023-24, with more than 29 manufacturing facilities across India",
            "content": "From its origins as a modest automobile parts trading company, the Rane Group has grown over the years to become a leading supplier of safety-critical automotive components. Today, it is managed by the fourth generation of the family, continuing its tradition of leadership and innovation. For the financial year 2023-24, it reported a revenue of \u20b97,200 crore, with more than 29 manufacturing facilities across India. The Rane Group was established in 1929 by T.R. Ganapathy Iyer in Madras. It focused initially on trading in automobile and automotive parts. The company\u2019s early operations were conducted from an automobile showroom on Mount Road. To accommodate its growing business, Rane leased a 22.5-acre land opposite Patullos Road for 25 years, with a rent of \u20b91,250 a month. This space was developed into a garage and automobile repair workshop, complete with office premises. Going public In 1936, the company was restructured and went public. On April 17, 1936, notice was given of the first board meeting of Rane (Madras) Ltd. to take place at Champaka Vilas, Luz, Mylapore. During the course of the meeting, the prospectus of the company was finalised and approved and shares were allotted to a few prominent personalities of the city. In keeping with the structure of shareholding in public companies of the time, the Rane shares were divided into preference and ordinary shares, with the former being entitled to a fixed dividend marked on the certificates. Allocation of preferential shares began on July 13, 1936. The company commenced manufacturing in 1959 at Alandur. Its first major product was the engine valve. Alongside this, it also made tie-rods. Over the years, the company expanded its product range, which now includes steering and suspension systems, friction materials, valve train components, occupant safety systems, and light metal casting products. According to the details from the company, by early 1961, Rane had established a robust distribution network across India. Among the key partners were Jullunder Motor Agency in Delhi, Conwest Private Limited in Ahmedabad for Gujarat, Central Automobiles Private Limited in Bombay for Maharashtra, T.V. Sundaram Iyengar & Sons in Madurai for the Southern States, Hyderabad Auto Services for Secunderabad, and Howrah Motor Co. Private Limited for the Eastern States. New plant for tie-rods A major development occurred in the 1960s when a new plant for tie-rods was inaugurated by K. Kamaraj, Chief Minister of Madras. By 1963, the company decided to relocate its tie-rod manufacturing from Alandur to Velachery. Six acres of land was acquired at Velachery, and construction began. The new facility was inaugurated on September 28, 1963, with large advertisements in The Hindu highlighting the Rane Group\u2019s pioneering role in auto parts manufacturing. The group received its first export order in 1968. According to the details shared by the Rane Group, it was received from Farnborough Ltd. by EVL (Engine Valve Limited) in 1968. This was for the supply of 1,15,000 valves to be fitted in Rover cars as original equipment. In 1969, Rane Madras made its maiden export supply when it received an order for clutch discs from Cairo. Harish Lakshman, chairman, Rane Group, says, \u201cRane Group has evolved over eight decades in the automotive sector, and I am proud of the legacy we have built across four generations of leadership.\u201d He adds, \u201cOur enduring success, from a small automobile parts trading company to one of the leading suppliers of safety critical automotive components, is rooted in our commitment to innovation, business excellence, and a customer-first approach. These values have not only sustained us but have also propelled us forward, ensuring that we continue to thrive in the evolving needs of our industry.\u201d As the company transitioned into a structured, professionally managed entity, the core entrepreneurial spirit that defined its early years was carefully nurtured. The second and third generations of the Rane family were pivotal in shaping the group\u2019s future. T.R. Ganapathy Iyer, the visionary founder, was succeeded by his son-in-law L.L. Narayan, who guided the company through a crucial phase of expansion and diversification. Narayan\u2019s leadership was marked by the establishment of Rane\u2019s manufacturing capabilities and the exploration of new markets, within and outside India. His efforts laid a strong foundation for the company\u2019s subsequent growth and success. The third generation continued this legacy, focusing on strengthening Rane\u2019s market presence and embedding professionalism in the organization. They were instrumental in further diversifying the product portfolio, enhancing manufacturing capabilities and forging global partnerships, which have been key to the group\u2019s sustained success. Today, the Rane Group is led by the fourth generation of the family. The company says the current leadership is deeply committed to upholding the group\u2019s core values of quality, customer-centricity, and innovation, while steering the company towards new horizons in the ever-evolving automotive industry. Three key subsidiaries Currently, Rane Holdings Limited operates through three key subsidiaries: Rane (Madras) Limited (RML), Rane Brake Lining Limited (RBL), and Rane Engine Valves Limited (REVL). RML is a market leader in steering gear and steering linkage products in India. Over the years, the company added new products. REVL manufactures valves and valve train components for a diverse range of engine applications in the automotive and non-automotive sectors, such as power generation, defence, and locomotives. And RBL is a player in the friction products sector, catering to the needs of original equipment manufacturers across segments. RBL\u2019s products are supplied to over 15 countries. The company says it is committed to achieving 10%-12% expansion in the next five years. To drive the growth, the company has planned one of the largest capex programmes in recent years. It plans to invest \u20b91,000 crore (over three years) to boost capacity across segments, including airbags, seatbelts, and steering gear.

            "description": "Jayanthi Kannappan, of ALS Productions, recalls the days when Royapettah was the hub for the film and drama industry before artistes shifted out to other areas",
            "content": "Long walks on arterial roads at Mandaveli and Santhome, now a luxury, was my favourite pastime as a school student. I got updated on the latest film songs through speakers in tea shops that blared all along the arterial roads of Santhome during the early 1970s as I walked to school in the area along with friends. Red-coloured MTC buses then used to resemble school buses, with students clad in different uniforms travelling to Santhome that was dotted with schools. I am still in touch with my \u2018bus-mates\u2019 such as celebrated newsreader Shobhana Ravi and Justice Aruna Jagadeesan. New phase After college education at Stella Maris College, I shifted to Ratnam Street in the undivided Royapettah after marriage to S. Kannappan, son of film producer A.L. Srinivasan, in 1975. (Mr. Srinivasan was the elder brother of lyricist Kannadasan). As I hailed from a bureaucrat\u2019s family, it was a complete shift for me. Royapettah, from which Gopalapuram was carved in the late 1970s, was the soul of Chennai\u2019s film and drama industry. The neighbourhood was the hotspot for actors, producers, drama artists, theatre owners, and film financiers. Royapettah-Ratnam Street, Dr. Besant Road, Thandavarayan Street, and Shanmugam Street were home to many film personalities. The roads in Royapettah used to be bustling with drama troupes such as TKS Nataka Sabha, N.S. Krishnan Nataka Mandram, and that of S.V. Sahasranamam. Many of the troupes had boarding for about 100 people, be it actors, musicians, and make-up artistes who rehearsed throughout the day. House became office Several actors and producers added to the artistic milieu of Royapettah. Legendary actor Sivaji Ganesan first lived in a house on Besant Road. After he shifted to T. Nagar, the Besant Road residence became his office. Former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi resided at Royapettah that is now Gopalapuram. Another renowned actor and former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran lived on Sannidhi Street along with brother Chakrapani. Actors like M.N. Rajam and M.N. Nambiar, veteran music director Ramamoorthy, director K. Balachander, and producer P. Pullayya were among the personalities who lived in the area. My father-in-law (Srinivasan), along with brother Kannadasan, occupied a rented house on Shanmugam Street in the 1950s before he bought a house on Ratnam Street named after his Saradha Studios. I still have the rent receipt of \u20b950 paid for the garden house. Royapettah was the haven for those aspiring to shine in cinema. Veteran composer Ilaiyaraaja, along with his brothers and film director Bharathiraja, stayed on Muthumudali Street and actor Rajinikanth, too, started his film career from a rented house in the area. It was very common to see many celebrities passing by the roads and exchanging pleasantries. Royapettah was a convenient place for many as Gemini Studio and Madras Cine Lab on Gaudiya Mutt Road were located close by.

            "content": "Commuters and vendors on S.R.P. Koil Street (North) at Thiru Vi Ka Nagar are facing hardship owing to traffic congestion caused by dug-up roads. The roads have been dug up for the extension of the storm water drains. The street, one of the busiest stretches connecting Thiru Vi Ka Nagar to Paper Mills Road, is lined with shops, restaurants, and street vendors. However, the condition of the road has been inconveniencing vendors and commuters. Murugan, a flower-vendor, says, \u201cIt is one of the busiest roads in the city. We used to have plenty of customers every day. But, owing to the poor condition of the road and traffic congestion, the number has drastically fallen.\u201d \u2018Expedite the work\u2019 The owner of a nearby stationery shop urges the Greater Chennai Corporation to expedite the work. He adds, \u201cThe condition of the road is affecting our business and we also have to deal with a foul smell and mosquitoes.\u201d As many shops have lost their direct access to the road because of the work, the civic body has built a temporary bridge-way to connect them to main roads. Many shops have been severely impacted. The shop owners believe that customers would rather visit more accessible locations than taking a difficult route. Shanthi (name changed), a fruit-vendor, says, \u201cThis is the season of festivals, and we usually look forward to it for good business. But we have not earned as much as we expected this year.\u201d People prefer less congested and safer roads, she adds. Another problem is the traffic congestion which worsens at peak hours. Earlier, the congestion was manageable; but, as a large part of the road has been dug up, the traffic moves at a snail\u2019s pace. \u201cI have been living in this area for almost 25 years, and every year, we have been seeing visible improvement and efforts made by the government for bettering infrastructure,\u201d says a resident of S.R.P. Colony. Pits being filled M. Dawood Bee, councillor of ward 67 in zone 6, says, \u201cThe work began a month ago and we expect to complete it in 25 days.\u201d She adds that though the roads have been dug up for the storm water drain extension, the pits are being filled, and the roads are levelled wherever the work has been completed.

Some of the residential areas along Poonamallee High Road, Grand Southern Trunk Road, Grand Northern Trunk Road, and Outer Ring Road are yet to get the infrastructure for flood mitigation. V. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of Varadharajapuram Welfare Associations, says Outer Ring Road from Vandalur to Minjur has become a barrier to the flow of floodwaters in their residential area. \u201cAfter the 2015 floods, we demanded better culverts, storm water drains, and a wider bridge across the Adyar. Outer Ring Road still remains a barrier to the flow of floodwaters. Culverts have been closed at five or six locations from Muduchur junction to Kishkintha. The government should acquire 10 feet of land along Outer Ring Road on the left side from Vandalur to Minjur to prevent damage to culverts. The culverts have been closed for the construction of private buildings. The road has a 50-metre-wide piece of land on the opposite side. The width of the Adyar has reduced from 150 metres to 50 metres because of the Outer Ring Road bridge. We need a wider bridge,\u201d he says. At the zonal committee meeting held last week in the Ambattur zone, councillors flagged flood risks in the area ahead of the northeast monsoon. AIADMK councillor J. John said the 30-feet canal from the zero point in the Ambattur Lake narrows to five feet when it crosses the 100-Feet Road from Padi Flyover to Retteri near Wheels India. \u201cThe water from the Ambattur Lake to the Korattur Lake gets diverted to other residential areas because the culvert is narrow,\u201d he said. K. Kumar, former Chief Planner, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, says the absence of drainage systems that conform to the natural contours of Chennai has exacerbated flooding, especially during the monsoon. \u201cWhen the CMDA was located on E.V.K. Sampath Salai between 1977 and 1988, the road used to be a decent one without flooding. I used to ride a bicycle from Perambur to the CMDA office on E.V.K. Sampath Road between 1977 and 1980. Perambur Barracks Road used to flood during the monsoon. The city\u2019s flat terrain, combined with rapid urbanisation and inadequate storm water management, has led to significant water stagnation and flooding, especially in low-level areas,\u201d he says. Without proper gradients \u201cMany storm water drains in Chennai are not designed with appropriate gradients, causing water to stagnate rather than flow efficiently towards canals or the sea. This issue is compounded by blockages from debris and garbage, which can reverse the flow of water. The consequences are disastrous for traffic circulation, resulting in a multi-lane road operating with the capacity of a single-lane road. There are significant gaps in the connectivity between storm water drains and larger canals. This disconnect prevents effective drainage of rainwater, causing localised flooding when heavy rain occurs,\u201d he says. Stressing the need for a study of flooding in roads such as E.V.K. Sampath Salai, Mr. Kumar says, \u201cEither a disconnect between the storm water drain and the larger canals or the changing urban fabric has severed the connection. The Corporation is working to address the missing links in the drainage network. But if the Corporation has drawn up a master drainage network plan conforming to the lie of the terrain is the moot question. If such a network is in place, the city might not be plagued by frequent flooding. Given to understand that the government of Tamil Nadu has made available to the Corporation the contour details at closer intervals through the Institute of Remote Sensing, Anna University, 10 to 15 years ago. The mixing of sewage in storm water drains further complicates drainage issues, as clogged drains can lead to health hazards and environmental degradation. Efforts to identify and penalise illegal sewage connections have been going on, but challenges remain,\u201d he says. Crucial culverts \u201cCulverts play a crucial role in drainage networks by facilitating the flow of water beneath obstacles such as roads, railways, and other infrastructure. They are essential for effective storm water management, particularly in urban areas where impervious surfaces increase the run-off. Culverts channel the surface run-off from one side of an obstruction to the other, preventing water from pooling on roadways and reducing the risk of flooding and erosion. By allowing water to flow freely, culverts help mitigate flood risks during heavy rainfall or storms, safeguarding infrastructure and ensuring public safety. Thus, culverts are pivotal in flood mitigation. Chennai needs to combat these challenges by implementing scientifically designed drainage systems that conform to the city\u2019s contours, ensuring effective water flow and minimising stagnation, improving the integration of storm water drains with the canals to facilitate better drainage and prevent flooding, and conducting routine desilting and maintenance of drains and canals to ensure that they remain functional and free of blockages,\u201d Mr. Kumar says.

            "content": "About five decades ago, long before he emerged as the stalwart of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Sitaram Yechury was known for his flamboyance at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. \u201cHe was handsome, charming, flamboyant and most girls fell for him. He was very different \u2013 non-partisan and an inclusive leader. He was crucial in laying the foundation for democratising student politics and furthering the business of open debate in JNU. That is how I will remember Sita,\u201d said Shanta Sinha, former chairperson of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, a JNU alumnus. Remembering Mr. Yechury, Sita for many, here on Sunday were alumni from JNU who either hailed or have worked in the Telugu States. For economist and former member of the Competition Commission of India, Geeta Gouri, the country lost Mr. Yechury at a crucial time, when the need of the hour is a coalition government, rather than \u201ca static one with a dictatorial viewpoint on economics and political science\u201d. \u201cSita was warm and generous. He taught me about Left movements and how Delhi was, when I joined in \u201873,\u201d she remembered. Former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Allahabad Rajan Harshe remembered Mr. Yechury as a polyglot, \u201cwho would speak better Sanskrit than any BJP MP\u201d. Mr. Harshe, who was on the same hostel floor as Mr. Yechury\u2019s for two years at JNU, said that his sustaining the idea of India, \u201cthat India belongs to everyone and \u2018We, the people of India\u2019\u201d will be a proud remembrance. MLC Kodandaram, who attended JNU between 1978-80, recalled Mr. Yechury\u2019s persuasive abilities to build alliances in the all-party meetings. B.P. Acharya, Special Secretary who retired as Director, Dr. MCR HRD in 2020, shared his memories and paid tributes by showing a cartoon he made of him. For an emotional CPI (M) leader Nellore Narasimha Rao, who carried the flowers and the portrait, Mr. Yechury was different in many ways. He shared his closeness, road journeys and campus life in JNU with Mr. Yechury. \u201cHe smoked under pressure. Cigarettes cost him his life. We won\u2019t see another Yechury,\u201d he said. Other speakers at the memorial gathering were Arun Kumar Patnaik, Venkateswarlu, M. Venkat Srinivas Reddy, Madan Mohan Rao, Shyamala Devi, and Sudini Laxmi Reddy.

            "content": "\u201cI simplify subjects that are complex and bring them to life through puppetry,\u201d says Isai Prakash, an artist who has been freely performing with shadow puppets, hand puppets, life-sized puppets, and forum theatres across schools and colleges in Chennai. Isai, along with a collective called Open House based in Perumbakkam, has made it his mission to engage in this one-of-a-kind, age-old form of storytelling. The artists at Open House have been tackling pressing issues like climate change, recycling, women\u2019s safety, and discrimination through the art of puppetry, all without feeling preachy. On stage, a colourful cast of animal puppets, including butterflies, spiders and elephants, bring these topics to life, making them both engaging and approachable for children and members of the public alike. Brainstorming with the team \u201cOur performances are rooted in community stories,\u201d explains Isai, who brings together storytelling, singing, posters, and dialogue in his shows. \u201cThe process of my puppetry starts with listening to what schools, colleges, or communities need at the moment \u2014 whether about reading books or to be mindful of their surroundings \u2014 and I start brainstorming ideas with our team. Even back in school, I wasn\u2019t a star student, but I\u2019d decode, dilute, translate everything through art to understand better. And that\u2019s exactly what I do now,\u201d he says. For over a decade, Isai has been performing free for those in need. \u201cCharging for these shows in schools isn\u2019t the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI fund the free shows by teaching theatre privately, and over time, I\u2019ve become a minimalist. Now, I even make my own clothes. A lot of us at Open House do the same.\u201d \u201cDeepak, Karthik, Dharma, Iyapan, and Yuvi of The Open House have been incredibly supportive,\u201d he adds. \u2018Less conversations\u2019 Deepak Nethaji from the Open House, who assists in scripting and making puppets from charts, chimes in. \u201cOur joys stem from telling stories and engaging in conversations of the hour. There are many conflicts because of less conversations. As a team, we aim to bridge that gap through art.\u201d Open House stages four shows a month. Their latest project? A puppet show for students at MCC College, exploring the balance between screen time and books. Isai\u2019s mother, Malini, also plays a role in every production, transforming into different characters. \u201cI became a dolphin for this show at MCC,\u201d she says. \u201cI was behind the curtain, voicing the character, but at that moment, I was feeding my inner child. Puppetry is my chance to rediscover a joy I\u2019d missed because of my domestic circumstances. This art, though, has only been a part of my life for the past three-four years, thanks to Isai.\u201d She pauses, reflecting: \u201cWhen Isai first ventured into puppetry, I honestly thought it wouldn\u2019t work in this digital era. But, after more than 500 shows, I am a part of his team, living the childhood dream I never got to chase.\u201d Published - September 15, 2024 11:23 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Addressing a press conference, BJP national spokesperson and MP Sudhanshu Trivedi termed the resignation as a \u201cdrama\u201d and said, \u201cHe is still the Chief Minister. If he wanted to, he could have called for a Cabinet meeting to recommend dissolution of the Assembly. Why is he demanding early polls and playing the emotional card.\u201d Reacting to Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s statement that he was leaving his fate in the hands of the people, Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said the people had already given their verdict long ago when they did not respond to the \u201cJail ka Jawab Vote Se\u201d campaign of the AAP during the Lok Sabha election. \u201cThe people of Delhi doubt that Kejriwal will resign, and his past actions and changes in statements cast doubt on his announcement,\u201d Mr. Sachdeva said. He said the people of Delhi were asking Mr. Kejriwal for an account of the \u2018Sheesh Mahal\u2019 (Chief Minister\u2019s residence) that he built with public money. \u201cIf Kejriwal is so honest, he should open the \u2018Sheesh Mahal\u2019 to the public and media and show where all the funds came from,\u201d Mr. Sachdeva said. \u201cGiven the deep-rooted corruption in the Kejriwal government, the entire Cabinet should resign because there is no department untouched by corruption,\u201d he added. The Delhi BJP chief said party workers would go door to door to expose the corruption of the Kejriwal government and liberate Delhi from the corrupt misrule. \u201cKejriwal\u2019s offer of resignation is an acknowledgment of the beginning of disintegration within the Aam Aadmi Party,\u201d Mr. Sachdeva said. Appoint new CM soon: Congress In a statement, Delhi Congress chief said, \u201cIf Mr. Kejriwal had resigned six months ago, the people of Delhi would have been saved a lot of agony.\u201d He added that the resignation looked like a \u201cpolitical drama\u201d as the Supreme Court had imposed several restrictions on him. \u201cA new Chief Minister should be appointed as soon as possible. The public of Delhi is aware and they will surely give an answer to the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s misgovernance in the Delhi Assembly election,\u201d Mr. Yadav said. The Delhi Congress chief said that in the past two months nearly 40 people had lost their lives due to rain-related mishaps and the people of Delhi had gone through suffering due to water shortage at first and then water-logging and accumulation of garbage. \u201cWhen Mr. Kejriwal could promptly sack Manish Sisodia as Deputy Chief Minister following his arrest in connection with the liquor scam, and Satyender Jain as Minister when he was jailed, he should have resigned too when he was put behind bars, but clung to the CM post so that his family could live in the palatial official residence,\u201d Mr. Yadav said. He questioned whether Mr. Kejriwal would move out of his official residence after resigning as Chief Minister, and allow the new Chief Minister to move into the official residence, or make a family member the Chief Minister so that he could continue to enjoy the luxury of the official residence.

            "content": "With the Adani Group winning a bid to supply 6,600 MW of bundled renewable and thermal power to Maharashtra, the Congress on Sunday (September 15, 2024) alleged that it was a \"rigged deal\" facilitated by the Mahayuti government, which it claimed was \"tottering towards a landslide defeat\" in the upcoming assembly polls. The opposition party's attack came after the Adani Group won a bid to supply 6,600 MW of bundled renewable and thermal power to Maharashtra for the long term after its quote of \u20b94.08 per unit beat the likes of JSW Energy and Torrent Power. Reacting to the development, Congress general secretary in-charge Jairam Ramesh said, \"Even as the Mahayuti Government in Maharashtra totters towards a landslide defeat, this is what they choose to do with their last few days in power. Yet another Modani enterprise undoubtedly! Shocking details of this rigged deal will soon start tumbling out,\" Mr. Ramesh said in X. Supplies are to start in 48 months from the date of award of the letter of intent. Later, the Adani Group, in a statement, confirmed the PTI news break. \"Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL) issues a letter of intent for 6,600 MW to Adani Power.\" While Adani Power will supply 1,496 MW (net) thermal power from the new 1,600 MW ultra-supercritical capacity, its sister concern Adani Green Energy Ltd. will supply 5 GW (5,000 MW) solar power from the Khavda renewable energy park in the Kutch district of Gujarat. As per the bid conditions, Adani Green Energy will supply solar power at a fixed cost of \u20b92.70 per unit throughout the entire supply period, while that from coal will be indexed to coal prices.

            "content": "Members of the Parents Association of Andhra Pradesh (PAAP) on September 15 (Sunday) said that the government should reconsider its decision of delaying the implementation of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) examination system in the 1,000 State-run schools affiliated to the Central syllabus. In a statement, PAAP State president Narahari Sikharam, secretary G. Eswariah and State honorary president M. Kota Reddy criticised the State\u2019s decision to defer the implementation of CBSE assessments for 10th class in the 1,000 schools and instead shifting the students to the State Secondary School of Examination (SSE) Board for the 2024-25 final assessments. They said that this \u2018abrupt decision\u2019 came after four months of the commencement of the new academic year, without considering the impact it could cast on students. Referring to the government\u2019s claim that students are ill-equipped to handle CBSE Board exams since the capacity-building of the teachers is grossly inadequate to prepare them, which made them susceptible to failing the final exams, Mr. Eswaraiah argued that a genuine assessment of the students in SSC exams will bring similar results. \u201cWill the government then cancel the SSC exams too?\u201d he asked. He emphasised preparing students to face global competition, adding that states across the country were adopting the CBSE and ICSE educational systems, as competitive exams are also conducted based on these syllabi. The leaders reiterated that any change made at this point would be detrimental to the academic interests of the students and urged the government to reconsider its stance.

            "content": "England have had to make another change to their lineup, as Josh Hull is sidelined with a quad injury. Hull, who recently debuted for England in the third Test against Sri Lanka, impressed everyone by taking three wickets in the first innings. Right-hand batter Harry Brook is set to lead the England side in the upcoming ODI series against Australia in the absence of wicketkeeper-batter Jos Buttler, who is set to miss the series after suffering a right calf injury. This will mark Brook's first assignment as skipper of the national team in any format, although the 25-year-old has previously led Yorkshire in the T20 Blast and the Northern Superchargers in The Hundred. England have had to make another change to their lineup, as Josh Hull is sidelined with a quad injury. Hull, who recently debuted for England in the third Test against Sri Lanka, impressed everyone by taking three wickets in the first innings. (Rohit Sharma To Ricky Ponting: 6 Batters With Most Stylish Pull Shot) In his place, Liam Livingstone, who is currently in red-hot form at the ongoing T20I series, returns to the squad after initially being left out. Livingstone recently expressed his desire to make a strong comeback, following his impressive performances in a new role at No. 4 for England in T20Is. \"I don't really know - that's one of my challenges. That's why I'm happy that I've got an opportunity to bat up the order [in the T20Is]. I feel like I've shown over the last couple of weeks, maybe a month, that the longer I get to bat in games, the more of a chance I have to affect games,\" Livingstone said talking about an ODI comeback as quoted by the ICC. \"I want to play as much cricket for England as I possibly can. Unfortunately, I won't be playing in the ODIs but it's still not something I'm giving up on. I've had a difficult couple of years. My body has probably let me down a little bit, and maybe I haven't been up to scratch physically, with a couple of niggles here and there,\" the all-rounder added. ODI series schedule: 1st ODI: 19 September, Trent Bridge. 2nd ODI: 21 September, Headingley. 3rd ODI: 24 September, Seat Unique Riverside. 4th ODI: 27 September, Lord's. 5th ODI: 29 September, Seat Unique Stadium. England ODI squad: Harry Brook (captain), Jofra Archer, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse, Jordan Cox, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Liam Livingstone, Matthew Potts, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Jamie Smith, Olly Stone, Reece Topley, John Turner.",

            "content": "A permanent Circuit Bench of the Karnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (KSCDRC) in Kalaburagi district, sanctioned by the State government in June 2022, will be finally inaugurated on Tuesday. Registrar-cum-Administrative Officer for KSCDRC Bengaluru has in a notification on September 13 stated that KSCDRC permanent Circuit Bench in Kalaburagi will be inaugurated on Tuesday. It will start functioning the same day. Appeals pertaining to Kalaburagi, Bidar, Ballari, Raichur, Koppal and Yadgir districts pending before the KSCDRC Bengaluru will be taken up before Kalaburagi bench. KSCDRC Registrar Mallikarjun I Kamatagi, speaking to The Hindu over phone, said that nearly 900 cases from Kalyana Karnataka region are pending before KSCDRC Bengaluru. Advocate and consumer activist Vaijnath Zhalki said that the KSCDRC Permanent Circuit Bench was sanctioned to Kalaburagi two years ago. However, due to the apathy of the authorities concerned, it was delayed. Constituting Circuit Benches will serve the real purpose of the commission, particularly delivering speedy justice to consumers and at an affordable cost. Mr. Zhalki said that the most aggrieved consumers from different districts are forced to travel to Bengaluru to fight cases in the State Commission, which often stretch for years. The expenses for fighting cases increase sharply if the petitioner has to travel far distances. Many consumers cannot bear such expenses and so, they do not approach the State commission, he added. As per notification, earlier 22 posts, a judicial member, a member (woman), an assistant registrar-cum-assistant administrative officer, a registrar (court recording), four stenographers, three first division assistants, three second division assistants, two data entry operators and six group D employees, were sanctioned. Further, in the revised notification, the sanctioned posts have been reduced to 12 posts. The sanctioned posts of stenographers have been reduced to two and the first and second division assistants to one each and group D employees to three. President of the District Bar Association Guptling S. Biradar said that constituting a Circuit Bench will lead to speedy disposal of cases and bring down the number of pending cases.

            "content": "After three years of preparations, two women officers of the Indian Navy are set to embark soon on an arduous blue-water voyage around the world. Lt. Commanders A. Roopa and K. Dilna will be undertaking the expedition of circumnavigating the globe onboard INSV Tarini , Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said on Sunday. Lt. Commander Dilna, who hails from Kozhikode of Kerala, was commissioned into the Navy in June 2014. Her father, late Devadasan, served the Indian Army. Lt. Commander Roopa, a native of Pondicherry, joined the Navy in June 2017. Her father, G. P. Alagirisamy, was part of the Indian Air Force. The two officers have been preparing for the Sagar Parikrama expedition for the last three years, Commander Madhwal said. \u201c Sagar Parikrama would be a gruelling voyage requiring extreme skills, physical fitness and mental alertness. The officers have been training rigorously and gained thousands of miles of experience under their belt,\u201d Commander Madhwal said. The officers are undergoing training under the mentorship of ace circumnavigator and Golden Globe Race hero, retired Commander Abhilash Tomy. The officers, as part of a six-member crew, had participated in trans-oceanic expedition from Goa to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil via Cape Town in South Africa and back last year. Thereafter, they undertook a sailing expedition from Goa to Port Blair and back in double-handed mode. Further, the duo successfully undertook a sortie from Goa to Port Louis, Mauritius again in the same mode early this year. \"Indian Navy has made significant efforts to revitalise the sailing tradition, emphasising its commitment to preserve maritime heritage and promote seamanship skills,\" the Navy spokesperson said. He said the Indian Navy has taken a centre stage in ocean sailing expeditions through the pioneering efforts of sail training ships \u2013 INS Tarangini and INS Sudarshini , and circumnavigating onboard INSV Mhadei and INSV Tarini . \"Continuing with the celebration of maritime skill and adventure, the two officers would be embarking on the extraordinary expedition of circumnavigating the globe onboard INSV Tarini very shortly,\" Commander Madhwal said. INSV Tarini is known for circumnavigating the globe with an all-women crew in the historic first Navika Sagar Parikrama in 2017. The circumnavigation of INSV Tarini will be a significant step forward in India's ocean sailing enterprise and maritime endeavours, showcasing the nation's growing prominence in global maritime activities and gender equality, the Navy spokesperson said.

The sudden downpour caught many by surprise, especially commuters who had to take shelter under shop canopies and trees, unprepared without raincoat after a hot, sunny day. The Telangana Development Planning Society (TGDPS) had not recorded any rainfall until 8 p.m., but by 9 p.m., several areas saw showers. Cherlapally reported 4 mm of rainfall, AS Rao Nagar recorded 2.5 mm and Kapra saw 2.3 mm. The rain not only disrupted commuters but also affected devotees transporting Ganesh idols for immersion. In the AOC area of Secunderabad, a pick-up truck carrying an idol and devotees was seen drenched in the downpour, adding to the challenges of the evening. The Hyderabad Disaster Response and Assets Monitoring and Protection (HYDRAA) issued a tweet on X asking citizens to ensure safety while commuting. Moderate rainfall is expected in a few parts of the city in the next few hours.

The country has set an ambitious target of becoming a $44 billion space economy by 2033, capturing 8% of the global market, exporting $11 billion in space products. Though several private players have helped ISRO manufacture rockets, satellites, and other space components, now many startups are making launch vehicles and satellites, eager to provide space-based services. The government is expanding its plans to involve more private players in the sector and keep ISRO focused on research. V Nivedita talks to Aditya Ramanathan, Research Fellow, Takshashila Institution, and Jayant Murty, The Indian Institute of Astrophysics, to find out how the sector can grow and how the Centre can build the space tech ecosystem in the country.

            "content": "A 36-year-old man was arrested by the Gudiyatham Town police on Sunday in connection with a series of burglaries in the past few months. The police recovered eight sovereigns of gold jewellery, silver objects and anklets, laptops, television sets, and bicycles from the accused identified as S. Mohan, a native of Nellore Pettai village near Gudiyatham. The police also found a collection of wigs at his residence. The police zeroed in on Mohan after he gave contradicting answers during a routine vehicle check near the new bus terminus in the town. Growing suspicious, the police had taken him to the police station, where he confessed to the crime. Mohan breaks into houses when the occupants are away. Once the burglary is committed, he would return to his native village to hide the stolen valuables. Mohan has more than 40 criminal cases registered against him in the district. Investigation also revealed that the two-wheeler he used was stolen from a resident of Gudiyatham. A case was registered. Mohan was lodged at the sub-jail in the town.

            "content": "The JIPMER Resident Doctors\u2019 Association (JRDA) will stage an hour-long pen-down strike confined to elective services, take out a rally and form a human chain on Monday to join a nation-wide protest in solidarity with the month-long agitation by resident doctors in Kolkata seeking justice in a rape-murder case of a PG trainee at the RG Kar Hospital. The JRDA, which was reconstituted through an election on Sunday, formulated the protest plan in response to an urgent call for nation-wide solidarity action on Monday by the All India Resident and Junior Doctors\u2019 Joint Action Forum (AIJAF) and after consultation with student bodies in other States, a spokesperson said. The nation-wide action has been timed a day prior to when the Supreme Court is scheduled to next take up hearing on the Kolkata case.In fact, when it called off its ten-day boycott of elective duties in August seeking justice in the Kolkata incident and concrete guarantees for workplace safety for healthcare professionals, the JRDA had said it was reposing faith in the institution of the Supreme Court to secure justice, but warned of returning to the war path if the core demands remained unaddressed. Though they had resumed regular duty, the resident doctors in JIPMER had continued with symbolic actions over the past month in solidarity with their peers in Kolkata. \u201cIt has been more than a month since we are fighting for justice and are no significant steps taken satisfying the demands,\u201d the JRDA said. The JRDA, which was reconstituted after a period of relative dormancy, will soon be reaching out to medicos associations in other institutions in the city to mobilise support for the cause if the nation-wide stir continues, a spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the JRDA elected a set of office bearers including Sharan as president, Santhossini and Adheen Murali as vice presidents, S. Shobha as general secretary and Mruthalagi SP as deputy general secretary. Published - September 15, 2024 11:03 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "The GST Council constituted a 13-member Group of Ministers (GoM) on Sunday (September 15, 2024) to suggest GST rates on premiums of various health and life insurance products. It will submit its report by October 30. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary is the convenor of the GoM. Members of the panel include members from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. The 54th GST Council meeting on September 9 decided to establish a GoM to examine and review the present structure of GST on life and medical insurance. A final call by the Council on the taxation of insurance premiums is likely to be taken in the next meeting in November based on the GoM report. Currently, 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) is levied on insurance premiums. The Terms of Reference (ToR) of the panel also include suggesting tax rates for health insurance, including individual, group, and family floaters. Also under review is the rate for various categories like senior citizens, the middle class, and people with mental illnesses. It will also suggest tax rates on life insurance, including term insurance, and life insurance with investment plans, whether individual or group, and re-insurance. Report by Oct 30 \"The GoM is to submit its report by October 30, 2024,\" said the office memorandum issued by the GST Council Secretariat on the constitution of the GoM on life and health insurance. Some opposition-ruled states, including West Bengal, had demanded complete exemption for health and life insurance premiums, while other states favoured lowering the tax to 5%. Even Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in July, saying \"levying GST on life insurance premium amounts to levying tax on the uncertainties of life.\" In 2023-24, the Centre and states collected \u20b98,262.94 crore through GST on health insurance premiums, while \u20b91,484.36 crore more was collected on account of GST on health reinsurance premiums. Minister Sitharaman, in her reply to a discussion on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha in August had said that 75% of the GST collected goes to states and the Opposition should ask state finance ministers to bring the proposal to the GST Council.

Governor, pending the structural strengthening and restoration of the 250-year-old Raj Nivas, is expected to be completed in four months. On Sunday, Lt. Governor K. Kailashnathan was accompanied by Chief Minister N. Rangasamy, on a visit to the site that would temporarily house the office-cum-residence of the Lt. Governor, to attend a bhoomi pooja. The Raj Nivas, notified as a Grade-1A heritage structure, had been declared structurally unsafe by the Public Works Department last year. The government had readied a plan to relocate the functioning of the Raj Nivas to a temporary office-residence at the newly-built building at the Old Distillery complex on the Vaithikuppam side of the Beach Road. The refurbishment of the building at the Old Distillery is being executed by the PWD at an estimated cost of \u20b93.88 crore. The restoration of the Raj Nivas is expected to take at least a year from the time K. Lakshminarayanan, Public Works Minister; A. Nedunchezhiyan, Secretary to the Lt. Governor; M. Dhinadhayalan, PWD Chief Engineer; K. Veeraselvam, Superintending Engineer and other officials were present. Earlier, Mr. Kailashnathan celebrated Thiruonam at the Raj Nivas with floral arrangement and the traditional feast. Members of the Kerala Samajam in Puducherry paid a courtesy call on the Lt. Governor on the festive occasion. Published - September 15, 2024 10:51 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

The star all-rounder Orla Prendergast shone with both bat and ball to help Ireland chase down a 170-run target with 5 wickets remaining and avoid a series loss. After recording their maiden ODI win against England at home in the third match of this series, the Irish side also ended their wait for the first T20I win. Kate Cross-led English side almost snatched the series win but the fans witnessed a late drama in the last over at Castle Avenue. After winning the toss, captain Gaby Lewis invited the Three Lions to bat first. England enjoyed a strong start with openers Tammy Beaumont and Bryony Smith adding quick 44 runs for the opening wicket with the latter scoring 28 runs before walking out in the seventh over. Beaumont top-scored with 40 runs off 34 balls and Paige Scholfield smashed 34 runs off 21 balls to keep England on track for a big total. Playing in her only second T20I game, Georgia Adams scored quick 23 runs in the closing stages to help England post a big total of 169/8 in 20 overs. Orla, Arlene Kelly and Aimee Maguire all took two wickets each but the likes of Freya Sargent and Jane Maguire proved costly for the hosts. Chasing a tough target, Ireland lost their star wicketkeeping batter in the very first over but captain Gaby Lewis and in-form Orla Prendergast produced a match-defining 79-run stand for the second wicket. England bowlers managed to take the game to the wire with Kate Cross and Mady Villiers taking two wickets each. Villers took two wickets on the back-to-back deliveries when Ireland needed 2 runs off the last 4 balls to win the game but Christina Coulter Reilly scored two runs on the fifth delivery to lead her team to a historic win.

India are the only undefeated team in this event, having won all of their five matches so far. \"We came into this tournament with very little rest or preparations after our Olympic campaign. Despite that, I am happy with how the team has done to progress into the semifinal stage. We had a good training session on Sunday evening and the mood in the team is quite upbeat. Korea is a tough team, they defend very well and can counter attack fast and skillfully,\" Harmanpreet Singh said. The Men in Blue last defeated Pakistan 2-1 in a closely fought game on Saturday. Reflecting on the game, the Indian skipper said, \"I think there was a bit of nerves in the match against Pakistan. After their goal, there was a bit of panic especially with some of the youngsters in the squad playing against them for the first time. While the focus tomorrow will be on ourselves, it will be interesting to watch how Pakistan to do against China.\" The India vs South Korea semifinal will take place on Monday, September 16.

India has committed $1mn worth of flood relief assistance to Vietnam and $1,00,000 worth of assistance to Laos, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced. Following this, the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force (IAF) have swung into action deploying ships and aircraft to ferry the assistance. \u201cDemonstrating our solidarity with the people affected by Typhoon Yagi, India is dispatching aid to Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos. Ten tonnes of aid, including dry ration, clothing and medicines left for Myanmar onboard INS Satpura on September 15. IAF is carrying 35 tonnes of aid comprising water purification items, water containers, blankets, kitchen utensils, solar lanterns for Vietnam. Ten tonnes of aid comprising genset, water purification items, hygiene supplies, mosquito nets, blankets and sleeping bags sent for Laos,\u201d External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on social media \u2018X\u2019. The IAF has deployed its C-17 Globemaster aircraft for the HADR operations to airlift aid to Vietnam and Laos. Swift and efficient loading and coordination was carried out by the C-17 team at the Hindan Air Force station, an IAF official said. \u201cThe C-17 aircraft, known for their large cargo capacity and long-range capabilities, are typically used to transport relief materials, essential supplies, and personnel to disaster-affected areas.\u201d Noting that several regions across Myanmar have been severely impacted by Typhoon Yagi, originating from the South China Sea, the Navy commenced preparations to provide HADR assistance. The Eastern Naval Command, in co-cordination with Eastern Fleet and other supporting units \u2014 Base Victualling Yard, material organisation and INHS Kalyani \u2014 have successfully completed the overnight loading of HADR pallets, including HADR gears, drinking water, victualling rations and medicines etc., onto the Indian naval warship destined from Visakhapatnam for HADR operations in Yangon, the Navy said in a statement. First responders India has been among the first responders in providing HADR to the region, the MEA noted, adding, \u201cOperation Sadbhav is part of India\u2019s broader effort to contribute to HADR within the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region, in line with its longstanding \u2018 Act East Policy\u2019 .\u201d Typhoon Yagi, which has been termed the strongest tropical cyclone that has hit Asia in 2024, has displaced millions across South East Asia and caused widespread devastation. Yagi started as a tropical storm in the western Philippine Sea on September 1 and turned into a Category 5 typhoon and made landfall in China\u2019s Hainan province with winds of 223 kmph on September 6. The MEA stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had conveyed sympathies and solidarity to Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh immediately after the typhoon struck Vietnam.

            "description": "Why is the upcoming election on September 21 significant for Sri Lanka? How has the political landscape in Sri Lanka changed in recent years, especially after former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ousted mid-term during the island\u2019s economic crisis? Who are the leading candidates in the presidential election?",
            "content": "The story so far: Sri Lanka will go to the polls on September 21 and the campaign has intensified with barely a week left. The election marks the first opportunity citizens will have to choose their leader, after they ousted former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, at the height of a crushing economic downturn two years ago. The crisis, which triggered unprecedented mass protests, was the worst the island nation has seen since Independence in 1948. Besides booting out Mr. Gotabaya, the Janatha Aragalaya (Sinhala term for people\u2019s struggle) sought to shake up the country\u2019s establishment with a loud cry for \u201csystem change\u201d. After Mr. Gotabaya fled the country and quit office, senior politician Ranil Wickremesinghe took his place through a parliamentary vote that he won with the support of the Rajapaksas\u2019 party, which still holds a majority in the legislature. Why is this election significant? It is the first poll to be held since the dramatic downturn of 2022 that saw citizens queuing up for fuel, gas, and medicines while contending with long power cuts. Elections to the country\u2019s local government bodies, which were due last year, were postponed due to a \u201clack of funds,\u201d while provincial council polls stand indefinitely postponed. What is different? Sri Lanka\u2019s political and electoral landscape has seen significant reconfiguration over the last few years. The once formidable Rajapaksas, who dominated the country\u2019s politics for nearly two decades, are out of focus this election. The country\u2019s two traditional parties \u2014 the centre-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the centre-right United National Party (UNP) \u2014 have been decimated, and now exist only in their rump, remnants, and records of history. Their breakaway formations have sought to detach themselves from the parent parties while drawing from their bases. Outside the SLFP-UNP domain, the National People\u2019s Power Alliance (NPP), led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP or People\u2019s Liberation Front), has emerged as a prominent third front challenging the old political order. In contrast to previous presidential elections, which were marked by a bipolar political contest, next weekend\u2019s poll is principally a three-cornered race. Who are the frontrunners? A record 39 presidential aspirants filed nominations for the September 21 election. One passed away and 38 are still in the race. Of these, incumbent Mr. Wickremesinghe, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, and yet another Opposition politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake are seen to be in the lead. Which political camps do they represent? Although President Wickremesinghe was backed by the Rajapaksas\u2019 Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People\u2019s Front that the Rajapaksas carved out of the SLFP they were originally part of) during the last two years, and still leads the UNP, he is running as an independent candidate. Mr. Premadasa is contesting from the main Opposition party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB or United People\u2019s Front that broke away from the UNP). Mr. Dissanayake has been fielded by the NPP. The Alliance is a broad social coalition whose chief constituent is the JVP, a party with Marxist-Leninist origins that has led two armed insurrections of Sinhalese youth against the state in the 1970s and 1980s. Additionally, Namal Rajapaksa, Hambantota legislator and son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is running from the SLPP. What are they pitching? Mr. Wickremesinghe, 75, is campaigning on a plank of \u201cstability\u201d. With a poll slogan \u201cWe can, Sri Lanka\u201d, he is seeking a mandate to continue his government\u2019s economic reform agenda, crafted to meet targets set by an International Monetary Fund programme. He claims credit for setting the bankrupt country on a path of recovery over the last two years. Mr. Premadasa, 57, promises to build a resilient economy in which the fruits of development will reach all citizens while enhancing educational opportunities and governance with digital aids. The former deputy leader of the UNP accuses his former boss and current rival Mr. Wickremesinghe of siding with and protecting the Rajapaksas. Mr. Premadasa says his presidency will be a \u201cwin for all\u201d. Mr. Dissanayake, 55, is promising change by \u201cweeding out corruption\u201d and eliminating the old political culture enabling it. He blames the country\u2019s political elite, who held power since Independence, for its downfall, and assures he can fix it through a \u201cnational liberation movement\u201d of the people. He says his leadership will build a \u201cthriving nation and a beautiful life\u201d. How is the winner decided? Sri Lanka follows a preferential voting system in which voters can mark up to three preferences against the names of the presidential aspirants listed on the ballot. A candidate must secure 50% plus one vote to be declared winner. If no candidate garners the majority vote share, a second count of votes will be used to pick the winner. The preferential votes received by the top two candidates will be factored in and the contestant who gets the highest number of votes will be named winner. Around 17 million voters, from Sri Lanka\u2019s 22 million-strong population, are registered to vote in this election. What are the leading candidates\u2019 chances? A three-cornered race within a fragmented electorate makes it challenging for any candidate to secure more than 50% of the vote. After a devastating economic crisis, the electoral appeal of the top three candidates rests on whether their messages speak to the concerns of common people, who are still struggling to cope with the high cost of living and their drastically altered lifestyles, marked by fewer meals or less nutrition in many cases. In addition to the vote of Sinhalese, who make up nearly 75 % of the population, the voting pattern of the island\u2019s ethnic minorities, such as the Tamils of the north, and east; the Malaiyaha Tamils from the hill country; and the Muslims, will decide the winner. How will the minorities vote? It is hard to say since the Tamil and Muslim political landscape is also more fragmented than before. In past elections, Tamils of the north and east consistently voted as a bloc against the Rajapaksas, who are accused of grave human rights violations during and after the war. In this election, however, there is no Rajapaksa contesting to win. Mr. Namal\u2019s last-minute candidacy is seen more as an effort to consolidate the party after many of its members decided to back Mr. Wickremesinghe. Tamils residing in the island\u2019s north and east appear torn between choosing one of the frontrunners, or a Tamil candidate fielded by some Tamil parties and civil society groups. It is their protest against the past failures of the southern leadership on justice, accountability, power sharing, and post-war economic development. Tamil voters\u2019 dilemma is also linked to their own political leadership being deeply divided on the presidential election and several other questions of policy and governance. While the prominent Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) is backing Mr. Premadasa, many other groups and politicians, including some within the ITAK, are canvassing for the \u201ccommon Tamil candidate\u201d, even as some others are calling for a boycott of the polls. Political representatives of the Malaiyaha Tamils are mostly backing Mr. Wickremesinghe or Mr. Premadasa. Workers on the tea and rubber estates \u2014 whose Indian ancestors were brought down by the British two centuries ago to work on plantations in Sri Lanka \u2014 are looking for relief after being severely hit by the crisis and its aftermath. They are also demanding housing and land rights that have been historically denied to them. Although key Muslim leaders are part of Mr. Premadasa\u2019s alliance, the community which lives across Sri Lanka, is voicing diverse political views. This election is unlikely to see a bloc vote from the minorities. What are the challenges ahead? The new President\u2019s job will be far from easy. Sri Lanka is in the process of firming up its debt treatment plan with its creditors and still has a long way to go before meaningful economic recovery. Ordinary Sri Lankans are reeling under the impact of the crisis. As real incomes fall and joblessness grows, scores of citizens are desperately looking for jobs abroad. Further, Sri Lanka\u2019s general election is also due soon. The country\u2019s executive President will need the legislature\u2019s support for his \u2014 there is no women candidate running this time \u2014 policies moving forward. No leading contestant can be certain about securing a parliamentary majority in a highly divided legislature. The road ahead for Sri Lanka looks both bumpy and uncertain at this point.

Drawing level Just when the Blasters appeared desperate with the clock ticking fast, seasoned defender Pritam Kotal came up with a nice curling long-ranger from the right which the new forward Jesus Nunez headed home for the equaliser in the second minute of injury time. But three minutes later, Majcen broke the home fans hearts with a nice cross to Filip Mrzijak on the right. The Croatian produced a sliding shot for the match-winner as Punjab celebrated. The match, the ISL opener for both the teams, was a midfield battle for a major part with both the teams failing to create clear chances for nearly 80 minutes.

            "content": "Taking over as the fourth chief of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) on Sunday at Gandhi Bhavan, Bomma Mahesh Kumar Goud turned a little philosophical about his journey from the grassroots to the top post in the Congress party and showcased his stern resolve to take forward the party\u2019s agenda of winning a second-term in 2028. Outgoing president and Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy handed over the party flag to Mahesh Kumar Goud in a symbolic gesture amidst the party stalwarts, including the ministers, former PCC chiefs and large number of cadre, who turned up to witness the change in guard. In his inaugural speech, he laid out his plans to strengthen the party urging the Chief Minister to spare time at least twice a month to instil a sense of belonging to the cadre who visit the party office. He also requested that at least two ministers should visit the party office every week and he would chalk out their schedule soon. In a measured speech, he recalled his journey from the National Students Union of India (NSUI) days to PCC president and said this is a classic example of how Congress gives opportunities to everyone irrespective of their social and financial positions in society. \u201cI know every inch of Gandhi Bhavan,\u201d he said recalling how he dreamt of becoming just a general secretary of the PCC watching stalwarts at the party office. \u201cNow I am the PCC president that I never dreamt of.\u201d Praises Revanth and Uttam for freedom Mr. Mahesh Goud had a special note of appreciation for Mr. Revanth Reddy and earlier PCC chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and how they backed him giving him total freedom in functioning. He recalled Mr. Revanth Reddy always spoke about repaying to the cadre who brought Congress back into government with their sacrifices. Attacks BRS politics He charged BRS working president K. T. Rama Rao with using \u2018social media without any social sense\u2019 and the senseless criticism of the government\u2019s policies. The BRS had looted the State beyond imagination and the government was now setting the priorities right. Leads a massive rally Mr. Goud performed a special puja at his residence under the guidance of priest Krishnamacharyulu from Dichpally who incidentally performed his marriage also. The same priest fixed the present muhurtam. Mr. Goud also performed special pooja at his chambers in Gandhi Bhavan. Earlier, he led a massive rally from Gun Park to Gandhi Bhavan, accompanied by Congress leaders and workers, after paying respects at the Telangana Martyr\u2019s Memorial.

            "content": "The Tiruppur Exporters\u2019 Association (TEA) has called upon the Union Government to come out with another edition of the production-linked incentive scheme (PLI 2.0) for the textile sector. In a memorandum to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Association noted that the current PLI scheme largely benefits large textile units, particularly those in the manmade fibre sector. To support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it suggested reducing the minimum capital outlay requirement and ensuring that the scheme also caters to cotton-based industries. Additionally, the Interest Equalisation Scheme (IES), which was extended by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry from the original expiry date of June 30, 2024, by two months, should be extended to all units for a year, the association said. The Director General of Foreign Trade had extended the scheme for Rupee credit for pre and post-shipment for MSMEs. The memorandum also highlighted delays caused by the Customs Department\u2019s Compulsory Compliance Requirement (CCRs) when importing woven labels. Importers face delays of five to seven days, as Customs mandates group sample testing in laboratories, rejecting shippers\u2019 lab reports or external reports from the country of origin. These delays affect export schedules, the Association said. The South India Hosiery Manufacturers Association (SIHMA) said the government should extend capital subsidies to units investing in machinery. It also proposed the establishment of a Knitwear Board to support garment units in Tiruppur. Furthermore, SIHMA urged the government to take measures to control the import of garments from Bangladesh, which has negatively impacted smaller garment manufacturers in the region.

            "content": "At least 40 people have drowned in a boat accident on a river in northwest Nigeria, said President Bola Tinubu on Sunday (September 15, 2024). The accident happened in Zamfara state, as farmers were trying to get to their land, said Mr. Tinubu in a statement. The president promised support for the victims and directed emergency agencies to assess the incident. Yazid Abubakar, a police spokesperson in Zamfara, told media that the accident happened on Saturday (September 15, 2024) and that five people were rescued, but 40 are still missing. It was not immediately clear how many people were on the boat when it went down. The boat was carrying mostly farmers who use the crossing regularly to sell produce at the markets and locals say they\u2019re often overloaded. Zamfara state is rampant with armed groups who kidnap for ransom, steel cattle and engage in illegal mining. Boat accidents are common in remote communities across Nigeria because of overloading and boats that are in poor condition. In August, more than 20 people died in a boat accident on a river in southern Nigeria after the engine exploded. Most boats don\u2019t carry life jackets or have proper safety measures in place, say locals.

            "content": "The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Thideer Nagar, here to conduct an inquiry based on complaints lodged by sanitary workers who alleged that a Sanitary Inspector of Madurai Corporation had used foul language against the workers while they were discharging their duties. Justice K. Murali Shankar directed the Assistant Commissioner of Police to conduct the inquiry in two weeks. The court was hearing a petition filed by a sanitary worker M. Ponnuthai of Madurai who sought a direction to the police to conduct an investigation and take appropriate action under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The petitioner said that she was working as a sanitary worker in ward 76 of Madurai Corporation. She alleged that sanitary workers who were working in wards 50, 51, 52, 54, 55 and 76 were being continuously subjected to verbal abuse and casteist slurs by Sanitary Inspector S. Ramesh. She said that the sanitary workers had complained to the Madurai Corporation Commissioner seeking action against the Sanitary Inspector. In July, the workers staged a protest in the Corporation Office. The authorities said that an inquiry would be conducted into the issue. Though an inquiry was conducted by them no action was taken, she said. The petitioner said that she and 13 other sanitary workers had lodged a police complaint against the Sanitary Inspector. However, police have not registered a case and conducted an inquiry based on the complaint, she said and sought a direction to the police to conduct an investigation and take appropriate action.

Anjaneyulu) asked the officers to meet him in the CMO on January 31, 2024 and directed them to arrest Ms. Kadambari Jethwani. Acting on the oral instructions, Mr. Kanthi Rana booked flight tickets for the DCP, Ad. DCP and other officers were there before booking the case and issued orders for the arrest. Mr. Vishal Gunni, who led the team to Mumbai, acted on the complaint against the actor without adequately investigating the case. The three officers were suspended for violating the All India Services (AIS Discipline and Appeal) Rules 1969 and for misusing their official powers. The government said action has been taken based on the inquiry report submitted by the NTR Police Commissionerate officials. As there were chances of the suspended officers influencing the witnesses in the case and destroying the pieces of evidence in Mumbai, the officers were instructed not to leave the headquarters (Vijayawada). At present, the three IPS Officers are waiting for posting.

            "description": "Home Minister G. Parameshwara had promised that security at the prison would be overhauled",
            "content": "A raid by the city police on the Central Prison Complex at Parappana Agrahara on Sunday led to the seizure of 15 mobile phones, chargers, knives, cash, drugs and various other goods. This comes two weeks after nine prison officials, including the chief superintendent, were suspended and a new set of officials posted over preferential treatment given to actor Darshan and other rowdy sheeters in the jail. Home Minister G. Parameshwara had promised that the security at the prison would be overhauled. However, this had not put a stop to the irregularities inside the prison. A few days ago, a visitor who had come to meet an undertrial was caught red-handed trying to smuggle 46 gm of MDMA. Another inmate had recently ransacked a room in the prison and behaving violently, raising suspicion that he was under the influence of either alcohol or narcotics. Alarmed by this, the southeast division police, probing the alleged irregularities at the prison, conducted the raid in the morning. Barracks including those housing rowdy sheeters Wilson Garden Naga and others seen with Darshan were searched and goods recovered, sources said. The seized electronic gadgets and mobile phones are being verified and prison officials in charge of the security would also be questioned, a senior city police official said. \u201cThere is a very strong network of prison officials and the inmates which has become almost impossible to break. Two weeks after the recent fiasco, all prohibited items are available with the inmates,\u201d a senior official said. This only shows that despite heightened security measures, CCTV surveillance and the Tower-Harmonic Call Blocking System (T-HCBS), mobile phone use continues inside the prison complex. Apart from mobile phones, chargers, and other electronic gadgets the police also confiscated tobacco products, a small amount of narcotics, knives and \u20b936,000 in cash from different barracks during the searches. It can be recalled that during a similar raid on the prison on August 24, sleuths from the Central Crime Branch failed to find any illegal goods to only later realise that prison officials had been tipped off about the plan and all goods had been shifted from cells hours before the operation. The next day a photograph and a recording of a video call of Darshan went viral, putting the spotlight on irregularities inside the prison complex.

            "content": "The largest gold smuggling seizure in Kerala occurred in 2022, with 80 kg of gold seized across 98 cases. Kerala, once ridiculed as a hub for gold smuggling, is now working to reshape its image under Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. As part of its ongoing crackdown on gold and hawala smuggling, the Kerala Police have seized nearly 150 kg of gold, valued at Rs 81 crore, and registered 337 hawala cases, confiscating around Rs 123 crore over the past five years. According to reports, CM Pinarayi Vijayan has instructed the state police to take strict action against the network of gold smugglers, and the recoveries and detections are a result of this crackdown. While there have been large-scale seizures, the Opposition, in contrast, has alleged that CM Vijayan was complicit in smuggling-related offences. The CPI(M) government of Kerala has refuted the Opposition's claims and has repeatedly provided data to back their actions. ADGP Ajith Kumar, who is also facing serious allegations related to gold smuggling cases, said that external forces like gold smuggler mafias are behind the accusations levelled by independent MLA PV Anwar against him and the government. However, according to Kerala Police data, in the last five years, 188 gold smuggling cases have been registered, leading to the seizure of 147.79 kg of gold. Since 2020, 337 hawala-related cases have been reported, resulting in the confiscation of Rs 122.55 crore. Last year, authorities at Kozhikode airport seized a total of 298 kilograms of gold, valued at nearly Rs 200 crore. Of this, customs officials confiscated 270 kilograms, while the police seized an additional 28 kilograms. The largest gold smuggling seizure occurred in 2022, with 80 kg of gold seized across 98 cases. In 2023, this decreased to 61 cases involving 49 kg of gold. So far, in the current year, 18 kg of gold has been seized. Hawala fund detection peaked in 2023, with 94 cases involving Rs 39 crore uncovered. In the previous year, 67 cases worth Rs 35.5 crore were detected. As of this year, 67 cases amounting to Rs 150 crore have already been detected.",

            "content": "The latest additions to the arsenal of warring Kuki-Zo and Meitei groups in Manipur, which are crude, unguided rockets with potential ranges of up to 5-6 km, has created a flutter in the security establishment. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has constituted a multi-stakeholder expert committee to investigate the incident which has wider ramifications, according to sources in the security establishment. The rockets are in addition to the hexacopter drones which both sides have now acquired to drop bombs and rocket propelled grenades (RPG), in a significant escalation of the crisis which began in May 2023. Also read: Manipur groups mark one year of conflict with cry for peace, justice \u201cAn expert committee set up by the MHA has been on the ground, and a report has since been submitted,\u201d two sources confirmed. While full details of the report were not immediately available, sources said one of the observations in the report was that the long range rockets were fired from Kuki dominated areas in August. \u201cThese are crude projectiles assembled locally with sugar and fertilizer stuffed into metal pipes. They were fired by Kuki-Zo groups in August, which they have been attempting since December,\u201d a source in the know said. These are dumb bombs and can fall anywhere, the source said adding that while these projectiles had no major impact so far, the potential for escalation was significant. The Kuki-Zo groups began developing them after a clash in May 2023 between armed Kuki groups and People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), a Manipuri insurgent group based in Myanmar territory, when the latter used 82 mm mortar, sources said. In the last few weeks, Valley-based Insurgent Groups (VBIG) too managed to procure similar long range crude rockets, though they have not been used so far, sources said citing intelligence inputs. These were procured from the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF), the armed wing of the exiled National Unity Government in Myanmar that has been fighting the military Junta. Officials sources when contacted confirmed the development but declined to comment further. On the use of drones by both the sides, an official source said security forces have now deployed counter-drone systems in some numbers to address the situation in addition to other measures. The military Junta in Myanmar, which came to power after staging a coup in February 2021, has lost control over vast parcels of territory, especially in border areas, amid raging fighting with various armed groups. Along the border with Manipur, two provinces are under the control of the Myanmar military while other provinces are now under the control of the PDF, sources in the establishment monitoring the situation said. Kuki-Zo insurgent groups in Manipur have a Suspension of Operation (SoO) agreement with the Government since 2008 which expired in March. As reported by The Hindu recently, MHA is reviewing the ground rules applicable to the Kuki-Zo insurgent groups, with one of the proposed measures being the removal of SoO camps from locations close to the valley districts which are dominated by the Meitei people.

            "content": "Reacting sharply to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\u2019s statement that Gyanvapi, \u201ccalled a mosque by some\u201d , is the Hindu deity Lord Vishwanath, Muslim religious leaders from U.P. on Sunday (September 15, 2024) described the statement as irresponsible and suggested that people occupying top positions refrained from creating divisions and taking sides. \u201cThe Gyanvapi mosque is a mosque with a history of several centuries. There is a dispute over it which is ongoing in the judicial system. The matter is pending in the lower court, High Court and Supreme Court, with both parties (Hindus and Muslims) putting forth their arguments. Amid this, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\u2019s statement that refers to it as a Vishwanath temple does not befit his position. People holding top positions must refrain from issuing statements that create division in society,\u201d Maulana Mufti Shahabuddin Razvi Bareilvi, national president of the All India Muslim Jamaat said. \u201cFor political gain, all this is said. He must refrain from such statements. It is irresponsible,\u201d Mohammad Sayyed Yasin, a Muslim religious leader from Varanasi, said. The Congress party also targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader. \u201cChief Minister Yogi Adityanath\u2019s statement is contempt of the judiciary. The High Court should fulfil its constitutional responsibility and issue a contempt notice to the Chief Minister for commenting on a pending case. By saying this, the Chief Minister is trying to pressurise the court in the pending case. This entire exercise is part of an attempt to change the Places of Worship Act, 1991,\u201d Shahnawaz Alam, secretary, All India Congress Committee, and a senior U.P. Congress leader, said. \u201cGyanvapi, which some today refer to unfortunately as a mosque, is actually Vishwanath-Ji himself,\u201d Mr. Adityanath had said on September 14 at the inaugural session of an international seminar on the \u2018Contribution of Nathpanth in the creation of a harmonious society\u2019 at the Deendayal Upadhyay University in Gorakhpur.

Mr. Bittu, the MoS for railways, made the remark in Bihar's Bhagalpur where he came to attend the flagging-off ceremony of a Vande Bharat Express train to Howrah. Condemning the statement, the Congress said he was talking \"like a senseless man\". Speaking to reporters, Mr. Bittu said, \"Rahul Gandhi spent most of his time outside the country. His friends and family are there. I think he does not love his country much because he goes abroad and says negative things about India. I think he is not a Hindustani.\" \"Now, he has got support from separatists, who always talk about dividing this country. They (separatists) and the most-wanted persons are also appreciating Rahul Gandhi for his remarks against Sikhs. When such people, who are also experts in manufacturing bombs, are supporting Rahul Gandhi, then he is the number one terrorist of the country. He is talking like a separatist. There should be a reward for catching him as he is the biggest enemy of the country,\" he added. Mr. Bittu alleged that Congress earlier tried to \"use\" Muslims, but as that could not happen, it was now attempting to divide Sikhs. \"Gandhi talks about OBCs and other castes. He has not been able to understand the pain of a cobbler, carpenter or mechanic, even after being the leader of the opposition. This is a joke,\" he said. Addressing a gathering of Indian Americans in Washington DC, Mr. Gandhi had said that in India, the fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban or a kada or he is going to be able to go to Gurdwara. He also accused the RSS of considering some religions, languages and communities inferior to others. Senior Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed Khan said people know about the Gandhi family's contribution to the country. \"Whatever Bittu has said is not acceptable at all. He is talking like a senseless man. People know about the Gandhi family's contribution to this country. Bittu himself was in the Congress. His father was also a Congressman. His remark against Rahul Gandhi is highly condemnable,\" Mr. Khan, the Congress legislature party leader in the state assembly, told PTI.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has intensified its election campaign, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Doda on Saturday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah is set to address three rallies in the Jammu region. \"Amit Shah will address three rallies tomorrow (Monday) in Ramban, Kishtwar, and Padder,\" said BJP Spokesperson and Media Centre Incharge, Arun Kumar Gupta. \"BJP is receiving an overwhelming response from the people across J-K and will form a majority government,\" he added. Gupta highlighted that under PM Modi's leadership, the BJP is contesting the elections based on the revolutionary steps taken in the past ten years for peace, development, and prosperity. The BJP is the only party presenting a comprehensive manifesto focused on public welfare, Gupta said. He added that the party is reaching out to the people with its development agenda, while other parties are misleading them with empty promises, aiming to return Jammu and Kashmir to an era of unrest and turmoil. Gupta remarked that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are wise enough to teach the National Conference, Congress, and People's Democratic Party (PDP) a lesson. It is notable that this will be Amit Shah's second visit to J-K. Earlier, he visited Jammu for two days, where he not only released the party's manifesto but also addressed a large convention of party workers in Jammu city. Meanwhile, on Saturday, PM Modi stated that the upcoming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir would be a contest between \"three dynasties\" and the youth of the union territory. He named Congress, National Conference (NC), and People's Democratic Party (PDP) as the three dynasties whose corrupt practices \"hollowed out\" and \"destroyed\" Jammu and Kashmir. \"This year, the elections to the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly will be fought between the dynasties and the youth of Jammu and Kashmir,\" PM Modi said during his first rally in the election-bound region. \"These three families are responsible for the dire state J-K was in for decades. They indulged in corruption and made you struggle for your basic needs. These families laid the foundation for terrorism and extremism in the valley. They provided a safe haven for the propagation of terrorism for personal gain,\" the Prime Minister stated. \"On one side, there are these three dynasties, and on the other, my sons and daughters of Jammu and Kashmir. The Congress, the National Conference, and the PDP are responsible for what has happened to you. They have prepared the ground for separatism and terrorism here. Who benefitted from this? The enemies of the nation. They harboured terrorism so that their financial gains continued. They are responsible for ruining Jammu and Kashmir for decades,\" PM Modi said. The elections in Jammu and Kashmir are scheduled for September 18, September 25, and October 1, with counting set for October 8.",

            "content": "As the deadline for fixing High-Security Registration Plates (HSRP) ended on September 15, the Transport Department is yet to decide on its next course of action. However, unlike announced earlier, there would be no enforcement action on the streets starting Monday. Previously, the department planned to impose fines starting September 16, with \u20b9500 for first-time offenders and \u20b91,000 for repeat offenders. However, an official said on Sunday that no decision had been made regarding fines or deadline extension, as the issue is pending in court. Until then, no punitive action will be taken against motorists, officials confirmed. Case in court Transport Department officials said they would decide whether to extend the deadline after a related matter is heard in the Karnataka High Court on September 18. Officials said that while 52 lakh vehicles in the State have complied with the mandate, 1.4 crore vehicles still do not have the required HSRP. In August 2023, the Transport Department issued a notification mandating the installation of HSRP for vehicles registered before April 1, 2019. Initially, the deadline was set for November 17, 2023. However, the slow compliance rate led to multiple extensions. The current deadline is the fourth extension by the department. The High Court is hearing writ petitions challenging the Transport Department\u2019s notification, which requires vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, to have HSRPs. The HSRP Manufacturers\u2019 Association of India filed an appeal against the government\u2019s notification. The association argues that all manufacturers with a valid Type Approval Certificate should be permitted to fix HSRPs. They claim that limiting the installation to manufacturers selected by vehicle makers favours \u201cinfluential\u201d HSRP manufacturers who already have agreements with automobile companies and their dealers to supply HSRPs for new vehicles.

            "content": "An alleged attempt to smuggle ganja in an ambulance was foiled by alert local youth in Ramavaram area in Kothagudem town in the early hours of Sunday after the vehicle got stranded on the roadside following a tyre burst. Sources said that the ambulance bearing Tamil Nadu registration number was heading towards Kothagudem from Odisha when one of its tyres burst early on Sunday morning. The driver of the empty ambulance sought the help of some locals to get the tyre repaired. The local youth grew suspicious of the attitude of the driver and opened the stationary ambulance door. They reportedly found several packets of ganja in the vehicle and immediately alerted the local police. The police reportedly detained the crew of the empty ambulance for questioning. However, the police were yet to confirm the exact quantity of the ganja reportedly found concealed in the vehicle.

            "content": "Four police personnel including a police sub-inspector attached to Banashankari police station have been suspended for allegedly foisting false a narcotics case against a few people without following due diligence. The suspended police officials acted on the behest of an informer who wanted to implicate his rivals to settle a personal score and used the police, sources said. The suspended officials are PSI Sridhar Gugri, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) S.K. Raju and constables Satish Bagali and Thimmanna Poojar, all posted at the Banashankari police station. The case was registered on August 9 by the Banashankari police following information from one Rajan, a police informant. In the complaint, ASI Raju claimed that the arrested persons were attempting to sell opium to the public in Kadirenahalli, Banashankari 2nd Stage. The case was registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. However, the complainants claimed that the case was falsified and a departmental inquiry was ordered by Lokesh B. Jagalasar, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South). During the probe, it was found that \u201cRajan had personal enmity with those who were arrested and he supplied the police with false information\u201d, according to a senior officer. The inquiry found that the four officials were carried away with the information provided to them and did not do the groundwork to corroborate the tipoff and are hence placed under suspension for \u201cnegligence, indiscipline and not doing due diligence\u201d. Further probe is being held by Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Subramanyapura and Rajan and his associates, who planted the narcotics, have been arrested for further investigation.

            "content": "Five members of a family, including a Chhattisgarh police head constable, were beaten to death allegedly on suspicion of practising witchcraft in a village in Chhattisgarh\u2019s Sukma district on Sunday (September 15, 2024), police said. According to the police, the victims, including three women, are residents of Etkal village in the Konta area of the Southern district. They were attacked by a bunch of fellow villagers who suspected that their witchcraft was responsible for a few deaths in the village over the past fortnight. So far, five men, also from the same village, have been arrested for the murders but Superintendent of Police (Sukma) Kiran Chavan said there were around 15 people who attacked the victims with batons and other weapons. The police identified the deceased as Mausam Kanna (60), his wife Mausam Biri (age not specified), their son Mausam Buchcha (34), who is a Chhattisgarh police personnel, Mausam Buchcha\u2019s wife Mausam Arjo (32), and another woman Karka Lachchi (43). Mr. Chavan said that after a couple of children died in the village, the locals consulted their Baiga or the local priest who pointed at the Mausam Buchcha\u2019s family\u2019s witchcraft being purportedly responsible. \u201cOn Sunday, a meeting was held which was attended by nearly 25 people. Once the victims, including the head constable in plainclothes reached there, an argument ensued between them and the other villagers, who held them responsible for the deaths. The matter heated up and things soon turned violent with nearly 15 among the crowd attacking them fatally,\u201d said Mr. Chavan. According to the police, the accused who have been held are Savlam Rajesh (21), Savlam Hidma, Karam Satyam (35), Kunjam Mukesh (28) and Podiam Enka. Further investigation is underway, as senior police officers reached the spot soon after the incident. The incident comes days after a similar case was reported in Balodabazar-Bhatapara district. In that case, four members of a family, including an 11-month-old boy, were allegedly killed on the suspicion that a member of their family practised black magic.

Sharing power with the alliance parties has been taking place in national politics since 1977. The BJP had accommodated its coalition parties into the Cabinet even when the party had a majority. There could be nothing wrong for such thing in Tamil Nadu, and there was nothing wrong in seeking share in power in the State, Mr. Thirumavalavan said when he was asked to comment on the statement of former AIADMK Minister K. Sellur Raju that the people would not accept a coalition government in the State. In a chat with reporters at the Tiruchi airport, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the VCK had been voicing power for the marginalised people for long. It held a conference in 2016 on this. It should not be construed that the demand, seeking power in the government, was against anyone or threatening anyone. Such a demand was genuine in a democracy. Decentralisation of power was a real democracy, he said. Published - September 15, 2024 09:12 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Nagpur: An Oman-bound SalamAir flight from Bangladesh's Chittagong made an emergency landing at Nagpur Airport following a medical emergency involving a passenger, an official said. According to Aejaz Shami, General Manager (GM) Communication, KIIMS Kingsway Hospital, a 33-year-old passenger named Mohammed Khair experienced two episodes of seizures mid-flight, prompting immediate intervention and emergency medical assistance. Upon landing, the medical response team from KIIMS Kingsway Hospital, Nagpur, led by Dr Rupesh Bokade, Consultant, Emergency Medicine, boarded the aircraft. Khair was found to be conscious, coherent, and orientated. His vital signs were within normal limits at the time of examination, GM Shami said. As per information provided by the cabin crew, the patient had suffered two seizure episodes during the flight--one of which involved frothing at the mouth, while the second episode occurred without frothing. Khair was promptly transferred to KIMS-KINGSWAY Hospitals, where he is currently receiving further evaluation and treatment under Dr. Rupesh Bokade, consultant at the emergency medicine department, KIIMs Kingsway Hospitals, Nagpur. The incident was reported to Shami, the general manager, who confirmed that the patient is being closely monitored and is undergoing necessary medical care.",

            "content": "Putting an end to the \u201cfeudal and outdated\u201d set-up at the Sub-Registrar Offices (SROs) in Andhra Pradesh, the government has instructed all the Sub-Registrars to be seated on a par with others at the floor level and not at an elevated position. Based on the instructions of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, the government has scrapped the existing system with a view to making the SROs look like any other government office. \u201cI issued a circular memo on Saturday, instructing all the Sub-Registrars to modify the seating arrangements at their offices with immediate effect. The decision has been taken after conducting surprise visits along with Revenue Minister A. Satya Prasad,\u201d R.P. Sisodia, Special Chief Secretary (Revenue), told The Hindu on September 15 (Sunday). \u201cThe system of using a podium covered with a red cloth and a partition around the Sub-Registrar is dispensed with immediate effect. The chair of the sub-registrar should be placed at the floor height and not at an elevated level. No blockage, or partition other than the office table should exist between the Sub-Registrar and the visitors. Sufficient seating shall be provided to the public who visit the SRO,\u201d Mr. Sisodia said. \u201cThe Sub-Registrars should treat the visiting public with due respect and courtesy. They should be asked to sit. If they have to wait for a long time, drinking water and, if possible, tea or coffee should be provided to them,\u201d the memo said. \u201cThough the registering officers are discharging executive functions under Sections 34 and 41 of the Registration Act, the Sub-Registrars sitting on an elevated podium covered with red cloth and a partition around them indicates a negative connotation of inaccessible and citizen unfriendly governance,\u201d Mr. Sisodia observed. People were prime stakeholders of the department and it was necessary to extend courteous services in all the SROs through a hassle-free and easy service delivery system in a conducive atmosphere, Mr. Sisodia added. He further said that the conventional system of using a podium covered with red cloth and wooden railing, or partition around the table of the registration officer was in vogue for long and the parties who visit these offices had to stand before them during the entire process. \u201cSuch feudal and outdated office set-up gives a very disturbing picture, and the visiting people feel intimidated and, at times, insulted by such an arrangement,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a more piquant situation if we consider the fact that most of these people visit the SROs for registering their documents from which revenue is generated to the government,\u201d Mr. Sisodia observed. \u201cActually, these citizens deserve full respect and courtesy as they are contributing to the State\u2019s resources, and hence they should be treated as valuable clients,\u201d he said.

Mumbai: Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar, who was recently seen in the theatrical movie \u2018Khel Khel Mein\u2019, and his wife Twinkle Khanna are celebrating their son Aarav\u2019s birthday on Sunday. The couple took to their Instagram in separate posts, and sent their best wishes to Aarav on his special day. Akshay shared a picture from their safari outing on his Instagram to wish his son. The picture shows Akshay, Twinkle and Aarav inside a safari vehicle as Twinkle looks at the camera through binoculars. The actor wrote in the caption: \u201cHappy Birthday Aarav! Watching you grow into the kind and loving person you are fills my heart with pride every single day. Words can\u2019t do justice to how much joy you bring into my life. May this year bring you as much happiness as you give to everyone around you. Love you always.\u201d A post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) Twinkle, being a writer, was more elaborate in her post as she shared how despite leaving home for studies, Aarav still lives in their hearts, diametrically opposite to what she thought would happen once he goes abroad. A post shared by Twinkle Khanna (@twinklerkhanna) She wrote: \u201cHappy birthday Aarav. When I used to listen to you repeatedly tell me how much you were looking forward to your independence, I would feel that when you finally leave my home and step into your own, my lights will go off automatically and my world will be filled with a bleak darkness. When you would return for a visit, I would light numerous diyas and pretend that this was not a permanent power failure; we were just celebrating Diwali. But I didn\u2019t realise then that someone who lives in your heart never leaves even when they change their longitude. My world lights up with every phone call, every message, even if it\u2019s about dirty laundry.\u201d Akshay had once shared that like him, Aarav also left his home at quite a tender age, and is studying at a university in London.",

After the arrest, protesting doctors said that they would continue their agitation for another 35 days if that is what it takes to ensure their colleague gets justice. Apart from the junior doctors\u2019 rally, several other protest rallies were organised by various communities in different parts of Kolkata. In Salt Lake\u2019s Karunamoyee area, hundreds of nurses also organised a protest march demanding a better working environment and increased workplace safety.

            "content": "The 2,500-km-long human chain as part of International Day of Democracy was launched from Basavakalyan town in Bidar district, where the first democratic institution in the world, the Anubhava Mantapa, was set up by social reformer Basaveshwara in the 12th Century. Hundreds of students from school and colleges, public representatives, religious heads and government officials read the Preamble of the Constitution that lays emphasis on liberty, equality and fraternity for ensuring the nation\u2019s unity. The students formed a 45-km-long human chain in Bidar district, holding the national flag. Some of the children were dressed like Goddess Bhuvaneshwari and Mother India. Minister for Forest, Environment and Ecology Eshwar Khandre, who inaugurated the human chain, said that the aim of the programme is to spread awareness about the principles and values enshrined in the Constitution to the next generation. \u201cOur government aims to achieve social harmony and unity in society,\u201d he added. He lauded Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for organising the historic event that stretched from Bidar to Chamarajanagar. Basavakalyan is the right place to kick-start the event as the first democratic institution, the Anubhava Mantapa, was established there back in the 12th Century, Mr. Khandre said and added that both Basaveshwara and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar fought untouchability and caste discrimination in society. Basaveshwara pioneered the idea of democracy in the 12th century itself and Dr. Ambedkar was the architect of the Constitution. Reiterating that the Constitution is considered as one of the best in the world, the Minister called upon people from all walks of life to strive to strengthen democracy and uphold Constitutional values. Mr. Khandre said that the ongoing work on the Anubhava Mantapa at Basavakalyan will be completed by 2025. The Minister also appealed to everyone to plant trees to increase green cover. Head of the Bhalki Hiremath and president of Anubhava Mantapa Trust Basavalinga Pattadevaru, Gurubasava Pattadevaru of Bhalki Hiremath, Minister for Municipal Administration Raheem Khan, Bidar Deputy Commissioner Shilpa Sharma, Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Girish Badole, Superintendent of Police Pradeep Gunti and others were present.

            "content": "The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is gearing up to implement the 'one nation, one election' reform within its ongoing tenure, sources on Sunday (September 15) revealed. This significant policy shift is aimed at synchronising national and state elections across India, a move that has earlier sparked widespread political debate. As the Modi government marks 100 days of its third term in office, the sources as quoted by the news agency PTI expressed confidence in the reform, stating that the proposal would garner support from multiple political parties. \"It will definitely be implemented in this tenure. It will become a reality,\" one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The recent development comes months after the high-level committee on simultaneous elections submitted its extensive 18,626-page report to President Droupadi Murmu. Notably, this committee, led by former President Ram Nath Kovind, held comprehensive consultations to gather perspectives from various stakeholders across the political and social spectrum. According to the report, over 47 political parties shared their views, with 32 supporting the concept of simultaneous elections. In addition, a public notice published in newspapers garnered 21,558 responses from citizens, 80% of whom were in favor of the proposal. Legal experts, including four former Chief Justices of India, twelve former Chief Justices from major High Courts, and four former Chief Election Commissioners, were invited to offer their insights. The Election Commission of India\u2019s views were also considered in the discussions. Furthermore, apex business organizations like the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), along with prominent economists, were consulted to examine the economic impacts of asynchronous elections. These bodies emphasized that staggered elections can lead to inflationary pressures, slow economic growth, and disrupt public expenditure and social harmony. After reviewing the input from these consultations, the Committee proposed a two-step approach to implement simultaneous elections. In the first phase, elections for the House of the People (Lok Sabha) and the State Legislative Assemblies would be synchronized. In the second phase, Municipalities and Panchayat elections would be aligned with the House of the People and State Legislative Assemblies within a 100-day timeframe. The report also recommended the use of a unified electoral roll and a single Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) for elections across all three tiers of government\u2014national, state, and local.",

            "content": "Haryana senior BJP leader Ashok Tanwar on Sunday (September 15, 2024) accused the Congress of having an \u201canti-Constitution\u201d and \u201canti-reservation\u201d mindset. A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed the Congress \u201cthe most dishonest party\u201d, Mr. Tanwar stepped up attack on the party raking up various issues pertaining to the Scheduled Castes (SC) such as reservation and backlog of jobs. Referring to Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi\u2019s recent comments on reservation during his US visit, Mr. Tanwar, at a press conference in Rohtak, said that Mr. Gandhi\u2019s remarks that \u201cwe will think of scrapping reservation when India is a fair place\u201d not just spoiled the country image by implying that we were not a fair country, but also betrayed his party\u2019s \u201canti-Constitution\u201d and \u201canti-reservation\u201d mindset. He alleged that the Congress, which had been in power for over six decades, was responsible for the backlog in filling jobs reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Mr. Tanwar said that any discussion in the BJP about reservation, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, could be only about the ways for its better implementation. Referring to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) figures during the Congress government in Haryana from 2004-14, Mr. Tanwar said an atrocity was committed on the Scheduled Castes every 18th hour in those days and recalled the incidents of attack on SCs in Gohana, Mirchpur and Kurukshetra. Recalling the viral video in which an elderly man talking about ticket distribution in the Congress made casteist slurs against Congress\u2019 Sirsa MP Kumari Selja, Mr. Tanwar said that none of the Congress leaders condemned the language used against her and no action was initiated. He said that one family in Haryana had completely taken over the Congress and it was difficult for any self-respecting worker and leader to be in the party any more. As the Congress and the BJP, the two major political forces in the State, get battle-ready banking largely on the Jat and Other Backward Classes (OBC) vote respectively, the SCs, who comprise around 20% of the State\u2019s population as per the 2011 Census, could be the deciding factor in the Assembly poll. The battle for the SC votes in Haryana has intensified further with Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) forging an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).

            "content": "Bittu, now aligned with the BJP ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, accused Gandhi of undermining India\u2019s image on foreign soil. Union Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu, who recently joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), launched a scathing attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Bittu, formerly a member of Congress, referred to Gandhi as the \u201cnumber one terrorist\u201d during a fiery address, following controversial remarks made by Gandhi during his visit to the United States. Bittu Criticizes Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Remarks Abroad Bittu accused Gandhi of undermining India\u2019s image on foreign soil. \u201cRahul Gandhi is not an Indian at heart,\u201d Bittu claimed, asserting that the Congress leader spends more time outside the country than within it. He went on to allege that Gandhi \u201cdoes not love his country much\u201d and misrepresents India when abroad. \u201cPeople who are most wanted, separatists, and experts in bombs and weapons are the ones applauding what Rahul Gandhi has said,\u201d Bittu stated, referencing Gandhi\u2019s comments regarding the Sikh community during his US tour. Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Controversial Comments on Sikhs During his address in the United States, Rahul Gandhi raised concerns about the freedom of Sikhs to practice their faith in India. \u201cThe fight is about whether he, as a Sikh, is going to be allowed to wear a turban in India; or whether he, as a Sikh, will be allowed to wear a kada; or whether he, as a Sikh, is allowed to go to a Gurudwara,\u201d Gandhi said, emphasizing that the issue was not just confined to the Sikh community but extended to religious freedom in general. His comments sparked outrage from the BJP, who accused him of defaming the country. Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri described Gandhi\u2019s remarks as \"sinister\" and alleged that he was misleading members of the Sikh community living abroad for political gain. Political Storm Ahead of Elections The heated exchange between Bittu and Congress leaders comes at a critical time, with political tensions rising ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. The back-and-forth between the two parties highlights the growing polarization in the political landscape, with personal attacks and harsh rhetoric increasingly becoming the norm. Both parties are expected to escalate their attacks in the weeks to come as they battle for electoral supremacy.",

            "content": "The Punjab police \\ on Sunday revealed US-based wanted gangster Harpreet Singh - alias Happy Passia - who is working on the behest of Pakistan-based BKI terrorist Harvinder Singh - alias Rinda - and the ISI. With the Punjab Police, in coordination with central agencies and the Delhi Police, having arrested the second perpetrator of the grenade blast in Chandigarh within 72 hours, the probe on Sunday revealed US-based wanted gangster Harpreet Singh - alias Happy Passia - who is working on the behest of Pakistan-based Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist Harvinder Singh - alias Rinda - and the ISI, handled the accused by providing explosives, weapons, and logistical support. \u201cFollowing leads generated through various sources, second perpetrator Vishal Masih of Gurdaspur district has been arrested from Delhi,\u201d Director General of Police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav said. On Wednesday evening, two individuals executed the grenade blast in Chandigarh\u2019s upscale Sector 10. Since the incident indicated a terror crime, Punjab Police and the central agencies acted and arrested accused Rohan Masih on Friday along with a weapon and ammunition. Masih is presently on remand with the State Special Operation Cell of Amritsar. DGP Yadav said the investigation has revealed that Happy Passia provided the accused with explosives, weapons and logistical support through his local associates in Punjab and also arranged some financial backing for them. After committing the crime, the duo came to Amritsar and subsequently parted their ways, he said, while adding Vishal first went to Jammu and Kashmir and then moved to Delhi when police teams apprehended him. \u201cThe probe also revealed that Happy Passia initially provided funds to entice the individuals involved, with the promise of a substantial payment upon the successful execution of the criminal plan. After completing the task, both the accused contacted Happy Passia for promised rewards, only to be met with initial evasion and eventual radio silence,\u201d he said. The DGP, while highlighting the exploitative nature of these anti-national elements, urged the youth to beware of these deceitful terrorist handlers who use and discard vulnerable individuals with false promises. Notably, this same pattern of betrayal by foreign handlers has been observed in previous investigations as well, wherein such handlers initially lure the innocent local youth with false promises and later abandon them once the act is done. Sharing more details about the grenade blast case, Assistant Inspector General (AIG) Sukhminder Singh Mann said in-depth investigations in this case are being conducted in coordination with the Chandigarh Police to uncover the entire conspiracy and local network of Happy Passia. Police teams have procured the remand of accused Vishal Masih till September 20, he added.",

            "content": "The Andhra Pradesh government on Sunday suspended three senior IPS officers following an inquiry into the allegations made by a Mumbai-based actress, Kadambari Jethwani. The Andhra Pradesh government on Sunday suspended three senior IPS officers following an inquiry into the allegations made by a Mumbai-based actress, Kadambari Jethwani. The state government issued orders suspending P. Sitharama Anjaneyulu, then Director General of Police, Intelligence; Kanthi Rana Tata, the then Commissioner of Police, Vijayawada, and Vishal Gunni, then Deputy Commissioner of Police, Vijayawada. She and her parents allegedly faced harassment at the hands of police officers at the instance of a leader of YSR Congress, which was then the ruling party in Andhra Pradesh. The suspensions were issued under Rule 3 (1) of the All India Services (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1969. Sitharama Anjaneyulu has been suspended on allegations of misuse of power and grave misconduct. He had allegedly instructed the other two officials to arrest the actress, even before a formal crime had been registered. There are allegations that Kanthi Rana Tata arrested the actress based on oral instructions from his superior on January 31, 2024, before the registration of the FIR on February 2. He booked flights for officers to Mumbai for the arrest without proper written instructions or due investigation. His actions were deemed to be misconduct and dereliction of duty. According to a separate suspension order, Vishal Gunni failed to properly examine the complaint before proceeding with the arrest. He too acted on oral instructions and traveled to Mumbai to arrest the actress without written orders or sufficient evidence. Director General of Police Dwarka Tirumala Rao had ordered an inquiry after the actress lodged an online complaint with the Andhra Pradesh police. She recorded the statement before Vijayawada police on August 30. Home Minister V. Anitha had earlier said that the government had taken the case of alleged harassment seriously. The actress had alleged that the three police officials along with some other lower-rank officials harassed her and her family in connection with a cheating case registered against her on a complaint by YSRCP leader KVR Vidya Sagar. The actress also alleged that she and her family members threatened to withdraw a case against the YSRCP leader registered at Bandra Kurla Police Station in Mumbai on her complaint. A case of cheating and forgery was registered against the actress and her parents at Ibrahimpatnam Police Station in Andhra Pradesh on a complaint by Vidyasagar. The YSRCP leader had alleged that she fabricated documents for five acres of land and extorted Rs 5 lakh from him. A police team had gone to Mumbai and arrested her and her parents. They were brought to Vijayawada and remanded before being released on bail. The YSR Congress leader reportedly had a friendship with the actress and allegedly started harassing her after she demanded that he marry her.",

            "content": "Relationship of Cristiano Ronaldo and coach of Manchester United Erik ten Hag was not good. Cristiano Ronaldo has been public about his views on Manchester United and coach Erik ten Hag. Recently, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said that the club need to \"Rebuild everything\". Interestingly, nobody knows what happened between Ronaldo and ten Hag during the Portugal star's second stint with the Red Devils but now Manchester Evening News has shared a story which gives an idea of what happened. The report suggests that Ronaldo threw a tantrum over his earrings after being asked not to wear them. According to the newspaper, Erik ten Hag directed his players not to wear jewelry during training sessions. While Cristiano Ronaldo had worn earrings under both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, ten Hag implemented a different policy. Eventually, ten Hag asked his assistant, Steve McClaren, to address the issue with Ronaldo. When McClaren informed Ronaldo to remove his earrings, Ronaldo responded by tossing them into a bush. Ronaldo has 638 million followers on Instagram, 170 million on Facebook, and 113 million on X. The Al-Nassr captain recently launched his YouTube channel and broke the record for hitting the fastest 10 million subscribers. Ronaldo broke the record by ousting Hamster Kombat. Hamster took seven days to hit the 10 million mark, while Ronaldo achieved it within a day. (Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Luxurious Car Collection: Porsche 911 To Rolls Royce Phantom, A Glimpse Into Football Legend's Garage) \"We've made history -- 1 BILLION followers! This is more than just a number - it's a testament to our shared passion, drive, and love for the game and beyond. From the streets of Madeira to the biggest stages in the world, I've always played for my family and for you, and now 1 billion of us stand together. You've been with me every step of the way, through all the highs and the lows. This journey is our journey, and together, we've shown that there are no limits to what we can achieve. Thank you for believing in me, for your support, and for being part of my life. The best is yet to come, and we'll keep pushing, winning, and making history together,\" Cristiano Ronaldo wrote on X. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner recently made history and achieved another milestone during Portugal's UEFA Nations League match against Croatia. He became the first men's football player to score 900 career goals. The Portuguese forward etched his name in the record book when he scored against Croatia in the 34th minute of the match. Nuno Mendes put up a perfect cross, which Ronaldo connected with from close range to fire the ball past Croatian goalkeeper Livakovic. The 39-year-old's goal also helped Portugal to double their lead and win the match. (With ANI Inputs)",

A true movement is marked by more serious activities.\"PTI could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.The ongoing protests demanding justice for a woman medic who was allegedly raped and murdered at state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in north Kolkata, are marked by sloganeering, street plays and collective singing of songs.Doctors have been staging a sit-in outside Swasthya Bhawan, the headquarters of the state health .",

            "content": "The concept of simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, referred to as \u201cOne Nation, One Election\u201d will be implemented within the current term of the Narendra Modi government, sources said, hoping for support from political parties across the board, especially partners in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The census exercise, not undertaken since 2011, will also begin soon, senior government sources said. The issue of simultaneous elections was highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi within a few months of coming to power in 2014, and a committee headed by former president Ram Nath Kovind also looked into the issue in the previous term of the Modi government. It recommended simultaneous elections for the Parliament and Assemblies, followed by local body elections within 100 days. Mr. Modi had reiterated his government\u2019s commitment to the move in his Independence Day address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, appealing to all political parties to contribute this decision. On the issue of the decadal Census, which hasn\u2019t been undertaken since 2011, sources said that \u201cpreparations were on and the exercise will be started soon\u201d. Referring to Assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir, officials said the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami cannot be \u201ccannot be confused and conflated\u201d. The proscribed outfit, which has backed several Independent candidates in the fray, had called for the ban to be revoked as it wanted to participate in electoral politics. \u201cThe outfit was banned because of its activities and that still needs to be reviewed. The ban has nothing to do with its desire to enter the electoral fray,\u201d said the source. Related Stories Law Ministry plans to place report on simultaneous polls before Cabinet at the earliest The government wants \u2018One Nation, No Election\u2019, claims Congress Uniform Civil Code, \u2018One Nation, One Election\u2019 to be implemented in next term, says Amit Shah Ram Nath Kovind panel for simultaneous Lok Sabha, Assembly polls Sources also said that as the \u201cModi 3.0 government\u201d completes 100 days next week, it is sticking \u201cto the resolve that it had in 2014\u201d, when Mr. Modi was first voted into power, despite the current iteration being a coalition government, more dependent on allies than before. \u201cThe government is strong and will last the full term,\u201d said the source, adding that there was adequate communication and coordination between the NDA partners. Government Ministries are planning to showcase the achievements of the third Modi government, but more as a continuum of the work of the government in the last 10 years. \u201cEven when political parties were busy preparing for the general election, Mr. Modi had set up task forces of bureaucrats to oversee various aspects of departmental work, including infrastructure and future priorities of any government that would come to power,\u201d said the source. Among the achievements to be showcased include \u20b93 lakh crore worth of infrastructure spending, governance reforms including the implementation and frequent review and reform of the Goods and Services Tax regime, and the New Education Policy (NEP), which sources were quick to point out was not even opposed by the Left parties, otherwise ideologically opposed to the Modi government and the BJP. \u201cClear and firm policy and periodic review and reform have been the hallmark of the Modi government,\u201d said the source. The 100-day programmes will continue on for the next week or so. The current NDA government took oath of office on June 9.

            "description": "They stood in the river water for a while seeking immediate intervention from the State government into the matter",
            "content": "Stating that Dakshina Kannada district administration is not preventing illegal extraction of sand from the Netravathi near Pavoor Uliya island, residents of the island stood in river water for a while on Sunday morning (September 15) seeking immediate intervention of the State government. \u201cSand has been clandestinely extracted from the river bed from Arkula onwards for the past two months. The extractors are also removing sand from the river bed close to the island. Despite presenting its photographs and videos to the Department of Mines and Geology and filing complaints, no action has been taken to prevent its extraction,\u201d alleged Gerald D\u2019Souza. Mr. D\u2019Souza was among the group of members of 50-odd families residing on the island, which is facing a risk of erosion, who stood in the river for nearly an hour. It was Fr. Gerald Lobo, the former priest of Infant Jesus Church in Pavoor Uliya, who took an initiative a few years ago to construct a temporary 1-km long foot overbridge that helped residents cross the river and reach the mainland. \u201cWe remove the structure in June and rebuild it when the water level recedes in October. The government is yet to fulfil our long pending demand for a permanent foot over-bridge to the island,\u201d Mr. Lobo said. The island is fast shrinking due to the impact of sand extraction and the level of water is rising. This is an issue of concern for residents, Mr. Lobo said. Parish priest Valerian D\u2019Souza said because of the Harekala-Adyar dam-cum-bridge, which is upstream of the island, water near the island is stagnant without flowing downstream. It has made people of the island construct temporary foot over-bridge. The families are solely reliant on the services of a few boats that ferry residents between the island and the mainland, he said. Vice-president of Catholic Sabha, Dakshina Kannada, Alwyn D\u2019Souza, said that after the residents complained about illegal sand extraction, the district administration formed a committee to study it. However, the committee did not have any representation of affected residents. The committee visited the area a few days ago without intimating the residents. The committee is yet to submit its report to the district administration. The Sabha will continue its fight for the cause of Pavoor Uliya residents till the complaint is addressed, Mr. Alwyn said.

The Union Minister said if those \"manufacturing bombs\" were supporting him (Gandhi), he is the \"number one terrorist\". He made a controversial statement in the context of Gandhi's recent remarks delivered in the US about the condition of Sikhs in India. The MoS for railways made the remark at the flagging-off ceremony of a Vande Bharat Express train to Howrah in Bihar's Bhagalpur. Speaking to reporters, Bittu said, \"Rahul Gandhi spent most of his time outside the country. His friends and family are there. I think he does not love his country much because he goes abroad and says negative things about India. I think he is not a Hindustani.\" \"Now, he has got support from separatists, who always talk about dividing this country. They (separatists) and the most-wanted persons are also appreciating Rahul Gandhi for his remarks against Sikhs. When such people, who are also experts in manufacturing bombs, are supporting Rahul Gandhi, then he is the number one terrorist of the country. He is talking like a separatist. There should be a reward for catching him as he is the biggest enemy of the country,\" he added. Condemning the statement, the Congress said he was talking \"like a senseless man\". Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit said, \"We can only pity such people. His (Bittu's) political career in Congress was also a mess. He used to praise Rahul Gandhi and now after resigning from Congress and joining BJP, he is showing his loyalty to the BJP party.\" Another senior Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed Khan said people know about the Gandhi family's contribution to the country. \"Whatever Bittu has said is not acceptable at all. He is talking like a senseless man. People know about the Gandhi family's contribution to this country. Bittu himself was in the Congress. His father was also a Congressman. His remark against Rahul Gandhi is highly condemnable,\" Khan, the Congress legislature party leader in the state assembly, said. Earlier, addressing a gathering of Indian Americans in Washington DC, Gandhi had said that in India, the fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban or a kada or he is going to be able to go to Gurdwara. He also accused the RSS of considering some religions, languages and communities inferior to others. (With PTI inputs)",

AIP, in their statement, said, \"A joint meeting was held today in which the AIP delegation was led by AIP Supremo and chief spokesperson Inam Un Nabi, while the JEI delegation was led by Ghulam Qadir Wani. Prominent JEI members participated in the discussions.\" It must be noted that several influential Jamaat leaders are contesting assembly elections as independent candidates because the organisation was banned by the Union Home Ministry in 2019. The ban was further extended for another five years in February this year. An AIP spokesperson said both sides agreed to work together in the larger interest of the region's population. The target of the alliance is to secure a resounding victory for AIP and JEI candidates, he said. Talking about the alliance, Rashid says, \"The main aim of the alliance is to raise the voice of Kashmiris. We will fight to find a solution to the issue of Kashmir...We will support the candidates of Jamaat-e-Islami and they will support our candidates. There will be a mutual contest on some seats...\" \"Following comprehensive deliberations, it was agreed that AIP would support JEI-backed candidates in Kulgam and Pulwama Similarly, JEI will throw its support behind AIP candidates across Kashmir,\" he said. The alliance has agreed to a friendly contest in areas where both AIP and JEI have fielded candidates, particularly in constituencies like Langate, Devsar and Zainapora, he said. On other seats, both sides will extend mutual support to ensure a unified approach to the elections, the spokesman added. He said, \"Both parties underscored the importance of unity in resolving the Kashmir issue and promoting a lasting and dignified peace in the region.\u201d \u201cThey highlighted the rapidly evolving political landscape, both regionally and internationally, and stressed that neither JEI nor AIP can afford to remain passive observers,\" he added. After the consensus, both AIP and JEI leadership have called upon their cadres to spread the message of support for each other's candidates. \"The goal is to secure a resounding victory for AIP and JEI candidates, ensuring that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have strong representatives who can articulate their sentiments and aspirations,\" he added.",

            "content": "After Union Minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) Gurgaon MP Rao Inderjit Singh spoke openly of his chief ministerial ambitions on more than one occasion, former Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij too has thrown his hat into the ring, staking his claim to the coveted post. At a press conference on Sunday, Mr. Vij said he was the most senior BJP MLA in Haryana, having contested and won six Assembly elections, and in fray for the seventh time, but had not made any demand of his party in all these years. \u201cThis time, based on my seniority, I will stake claim to the post of Chief Minister. It is for the high command to decide whether to make me the Chief Minister or not. But if I am made the Chief Minister, I will change the destiny and the face of Haryana,\u201d Mr. Vij, contesting from the Ambala Cantonment Assembly constituency, said. He said that people from his constituency and across Haryana had been meeting him, and it was at their behest that he was staking claim to the CM\u2019s post. However, his senior party colleague disagreed. \u201cHaryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini is the BJP\u2019s CM face and the party will score a hat-trick of wins in the State under his leadership,\u201d Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Sunday, describing Mr. Saini as a popular leader in the State. \u201cBeing a party worker, he [Mr. Vij] may have said so, but Nayab Singh Saini is the BJP\u2019s CM face,\u201d Mr. Pradhan, who is the party\u2019s in-charge for the Haryana election, told reporters in Karnal, when asked about Mr. Vij\u2019s comment. \u201cThe Ladwa Assembly has become a major political centre of Haryana elections. Ladle (dear one) Nayab Singh Saini of this place has left a special mark in the country in a very short time,\u201d Mr. Pradhan said in a post on social media platform X. Mr. Saini has taken \u201cfar-sighted\u201d decisions for the welfare of every section, thereby setting an example for the country, Mr. Pradhan said. Previously, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had, at a meeting of the party\u2019s State executive in Panchkula in June, had announced that the BJP would contest the upcoming Assembly election in Haryana under the leadership of Mr. Saini. When pointed out that Mr. Saini has already been declared the chief ministerial candidate, Mr. Vij told the PTI, \u201cThere is no bar on staking the claim. I will make my claim, let the party take a call.\u201d Known as \u2018Gabbar\u2019 in Haryana\u2019s political circles for his image of a \u201cstern\u201d administrator, Mr. Vij is also known for his mercurial and impulsive temperament, which is said to have cost him a berth in the Cabinet reshuffle in March this year, after he stormed out of the Chandigarh meeting to elect Mr. Saini as the BJP\u2019s new Haryana Chief Minister at the time. He later said that he, being the senior-most BJP leader, was not kept in loop over the change in State leadership. Mr. Vij was dropped from the Haryana Cabinet after Mr. Saini was sworn in as CM. He also had differences with former Chief Minister Manohar Lal over alleged interference in his Ministry. A prominent Ahir leader in south Haryana, Mr. Singh, who had joined the BJP after quitting the Congress in 2014, has also on several occasions earlier and over the past few weeks expressed his desire to be the next Chief Minister of the State. He has often regretted that despite the Ahirwal belt, that is, the Gurgaon-Rewari-Mahendragarh region contributing significantly to the BJP forming governments in Haryana in 2014 and 2019, the community had not received its due. Former BJP president and senior Brahmin leader Ram Bilas Sharma, who was denied the party\u2019s ticket from Mahendragarh this time, is supporting Mr. Singh, alluding at a public meeting at Ateli recently to having the next CM from south Haryana. Mr. Singh reacted to Mr. Sharma\u2019s statement while speaking to a TV news channel. \u201cIf we get enough support and MLAs from south Haryana, the MLAs too would have their say. And going by the political influence of this region, the Centre will bless us for it,\u201d Mr. Singh said. Some political analysts, however, believe that the announcement of Mr. Saini as next the Chief Minister has not created enough buzz for the BJP on the ground, and it could be the party\u2019s new strategy to allow its prominent leaders from different communities to stake claim to the CM\u2019s post to win support in their respective regions.

            "content": "The desilting of the Kottai Vaikal on Old Karur Road in Tiruchi has been delayed disappointing local residents. The Kottai Vaikal was once an irrigation channel \u2013 on a par with the Uyyakondan Canal. But over time, as ayacuts were cut up and transformed into residential areas, the irrigation canals lost their use and became a place for dumping sewage. Due to this, the canal has become an open drain where one can notice sewage and flotsam of refuse atop the water, which then helps breed mosquitoes in the region along its stretch. The floating water hyacinth also contributes to breeding mosquitoes. Running about 1.8 km, the condition of Kottai Vaikal is deplorable as one cannot pass through the bridge without breathing in its malodorous stench. Though there are shutters along the sides of the bridge, they appear to be dilapidated, which could cause sewage from Subramania Swami Koil Street to mix with sewage on Kaveri Nagar, making it worse for the residents. The residents living along the canal have expressed severe disapproval over the unchanging nature of the waterbody and its unmanaged sewage system. \u201cWe know that the condition of the canal cannot be changed, but we think that at least reverting the flow of sewage from the vaikal into properly covered sewage drains would make this less polluted. We cannot sleep because of the mosquitoes coming from the area, and during the day, we suffocate inside our homes because when we open the windows, the stench becomes unbearable,\u201d said P. Indrani, a resident. Meanwhile, the civic body has begun desilting the canal, and a portion of the water body along Subramania Swami Koil Street has been desilted. \u201cThe entire canal would be completed in two weeks, and the broken shutters would also be fixed. The situation will get better after the completion of phase IV of the underground sewage system in the city. This would make such canals to not be used to transport sewage and thus improve the lives of the residents,\u201d said V. Saravanan, Corporation Commissioner.

            "content": "Students, leaders, members of non-government agencies and citizens participated in a human chain formed across the districts to celebrate the International Day of Democracy on Sunday. Participants stood holding hands and read the Preamble of the Constitution. In Belagavi, leaders and officers inaugurated the chain by paying floral tributes to an image of the preamble of the Constitution, in front of the Suvarna Soudha in the morning. Folk artists performed along the way. Minister Satish Jarkiholi described the human chain as an effort to create a sense of kinship among all human beings. \u201cWe need to understand what democracy is. It is a system of governance that allows expression of diverse voices and ensures protection of fundamental rights. We need to celebrate it and remind ourselves of the ideals and principles of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy is a powerful and dynamic force that helps us realize our highest aspirations for freedom, equality and justice,\u201d he added. He said that the idea of democracy is surrounded by the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity and that it is every citizen\u2019s duty to protect it. It is the Constitution drafted by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and his associates that has created a strong and successful democracy. \u201cWe need to preserve it, though there are still so many social and economic inequalities,\u201d he said. \u201cSeptember 15 is being celebrated the International Day of Democracy across the world after the UNO declared it so in 2007. A resolution covering the values, ideals, principles and its application of democracy worldwide was passed by the general assembly then,\u201d he said. \u201cThe purpose behind this was to protect democracy and promote it in countries that did not adopt it,\u201d he added. The State government decided to form the human chain on this day across the State to celebrate that spirit. A 145-km-long chain has been formed in Belagavi district from Salahalli in Ramadurga to Tegur village in Kittur taluk, he said. Minister Lakshmi Hebbalakar said that the effort to send a message of humanitarian values has been unprecedented and can create an international record.

            "content": "The Delhi Police arrested seven people after it busted a gang of counterfeit visas operating in the Tilak Nagar area in the national capital. Delhi News: The Delhi Police on Sunday busted a gang of counterfeit visas operating in west Delhi's Tilak Nagar area and arrested at least seven people. The officials said that a huge quantity of equipment used in manufacturing fake visas has been seized from the house of the main accused. Besides this, police also recovered 14 Nepalese and two Indian passports. According to the police, the accused have been identified as Manoj Monga (51), the main accused from Tilak Nagar, Shiva Gautam (42), Naveen Rana (25), Balbir Singh (65), Jaswinder Singh (55), Ashif Ali (27) and a passenger, Sandeep. Speaking on the action against the fake visa gang, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) (IGI Airport) Usha Rangnani said that on the night of September 2, Sandeep from Haryana went to the departure immigration counter at Indira Gandhi International Airport in the national capital with an Indian passport. He intended to depart for Rome in Italy, but during scrutiny of his documents, a fake Swedish visa was found affixed to his passport, and he was arrested, the police official said. Following the arrest, an FIR was filed and an investigation was launched, she said. Sandeep, who was looking to move abroad, had contacted Ashif Ali, a travel agent, police said. Ali agreed to send Sandeep to a European country in lieu of Rs 10 lakh. The police further informed that Sandeep paid Rs seven lakh in two bank accounts of the agent and paid Rs 50,000 in cash. Ali and his associates\u2014Naveen Rana and Shiva Gautam\u2014arranged tickets and a Swedish visa for Sandeep's journey to Rome, the DCP said. The revelations made by Sandeep led to the busting of a fake visa racket operating out of the national capital for the last five years. According to an NDTV report, the alleged racket had produced four to five thousand forged visas so far and had made Rs 300 crore doing so. According to the police, the gang was making 30-60 fake visas of several countries, including those in Europe, every month and could prepare a visa sticker in just 20 minutes. Every fake visa made by the gang was sold for \u20b9 8-10 lakh, the NDTV report stated. The racket used Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp for communication and had an intricate web of local agents who would connect with people seeking jobs in foreign countries. Ali, Rana, and Gautam were arrested, which led to the arrest of Balbir Singh and Jaswinder Singh, she said. Following his arrest, Jaswinder Singh disclosed the name of Manoj Monga, who is an expert in the design and preparation of fake stickers, police said. Monga was arrested from his house in Tilak Nagar, where he was running his fake visa business, they said. According to police, five years ago, Monga came in contact with Jaideep Singh, and they established an illegal factory for manufacturing fake visas at Monga's house. Later, Monga also began providing fake appointment letters to his customers so that their visas looked legitimate, the DCP said. During the investigation, police said that 30 fake sticker visas issued in the names of different persons, 23 rubber stamps of various countries, three fake Permanent Residency (PR) cards of Italy, three wooden dyes of different embassies, four metal dyes of different countries, 14 original Nepalese passports, two original Indian passports, and many other items were recovered from Monga's house. Further investigation in the case is underway, and efforts are underway to nab the other associates, police further stated. (With PTI Inputs)",

In a sharp attack on his political opponents, particularly against the Shiv Sena faction led by Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Thackeray during the event lashed the splintered group. He said, \"Those who have betrayed me, those I considered my family, who were politically born from the womb of Shiv Sena\u2014if they can attack that Shiv Sena mother, then can't they betray the people as well?\" Moreover, during the address, Thackeray continued by distancing himself from the political power play, stating that his aim was never to hold onto power. \"That is why I do not want this government. Even then, I did not dream of becoming Chief Minister, and even today, this is not my dream,\" Thackeray asserted. Meanwhile, on Uddhav Thackeray's statement that he has no dream of becoming CM, Shinde faction leader and cabinet minister Shambhuraje Desai said that in the Lok Sabha elections, Uddhav Thackeray's party's strength has decreased, his party has become weak, so he had to be satisfied with the seats given by Congress and NCP; other than this, he has no other option, so now he is giving up his demand for the CM post.",

            "description": "Western and southern states have sufficient doctors, but not east and north India, doctors say",
            "content": "The Indian Medical Association has decided to launch a portal for MBBS graduates to find employment. The aim of the portal is to open up employment opportunities for young doctors, said R.V.Asokan, national president of IMA. He was in Chennai on Sunday for an event organised by the association. \u201cThere is a myth that there is a shortage of doctors. It is not true. We have an excess of doctors. In the southern States the ratio of doctors to patients is 1:500, whereas the Union government has informed Parliament that all India ratio is 1:830,\u201d Dr. Asokan said. Currently the country has 1,09,800 MBBS seats and 65,000 postgraduate seats. \u201cEvery year 45,000 students are left behind post NEET-PG (exam). These doctors do not go back to jobs but prepare for the exam again by taking up coaching. They are unemployed, some of them are married and dependant on their family. There is a lot of frustration,\u201d Dr. Asokan added, explaining the reason for creating a web portal. The web portal would help a candidate find employment if their profile matched the requirement, he said. In October the association would open an overseas vertical to enable young doctors apply for positions elsewhere. As a third vertical there would be a portal to offer overseas career development orientation. \u201cWe are bringing in all these three \u2013 national employment, overseas employment and overseas career development into one scheme,\u201d Dr. Asokan said. On whether young doctors would be willing to relocate to distant States considering the language barriers they may have to surmount, Dr. Asokan said, \u201cDoctors are produced for the country. There is an excess of doctors across the southern States. In Kerala, where I have been working for the past 42 years, the ratio is now 1:500. Along the western States such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa too there are sufficient doctors. When the Union government introduces another 72,000 seats the number of doctors would touch 10 lakh. \u201cThis is more than what we need. With the National Health Mission appointing ad hoc doctors, the opportunities for government jobs have been closed,\u201d he explained. The dignity of the profession was hurt because of the ad hoc appointments and the fact that many doctors were asked to do one-day night shifts, he said. Instead of focusing on opening more medical colleges, the government should open more nursing colleges to build a strong paramedical force, Dr. Asokan suggested.

            "description": "It is disgraceful on the part of the State government to say that it is not in a position to provide facilities in colleges that have been approved by the NMC, says student union",
            "content": "The National Medical Commission\u2019s (NMC) withdrawal of permission for the launch of Dr. YSR Government Medical College at Pulivendula in Kadapa district for the academic year 2024-25, upon receiving a letter from the Director of Medical Education, Andhra Pradesh, stating that the college did not have the required infrastructure, drew criticism from the Congress party and student unions. The DME\u2019s letter suggested that the NMC should not consider admissions in this academic year (2024-25) as the college\u2019s work was still not complete, and the college was not in a position to provide complete facilities to the students. The Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) granted the college a letter of permission on August 16, 2024, to establish a new medical college with 50 MBBS seats. The government\u2019s decision to drop the launch this academic year has been sharply criticised by leaders of students\u2019 unions and the Congress party. Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) president Y.S. Sharmila, on Sunday, September 15, slammed the TDP-led coalition government in the State for its decision not to go ahead with the admissions in the college this academic year. She alleged that the government had plans to privatise the new medical colleges in the State and hand over medical education to private individuals, which in turn \u201cwill deprive poor students of medical education.\u201d Referring to the reports that the government plans to study the Gujarat Public-Private Partnership model (PPP), she said Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu should explain to the people of the State the government\u2019s stand on privatisation to allay their fears. She said the fact that the government had expressed inability to provide facilities at the five new colleges at Pulivendula, Adoni, Markapuram, Madanapalle and Paderu despite being an active part of the coalition government at the Centre proved its inefficiency. She said the government decision had dashed the hopes of medical students who would now be forced to look at the neighbouring States to pursue medicine. Leaders of All-India Student Federation (AISF) have said that it was disgraceful on the part of the government to say that it is not in a position to provide facilities in colleges that have been approved by the NMC. At a press conference, the federation\u2019s state president V. Johnson Babu and vice-presidents B. Naser and M. Sai Kumar said that while the previous YSR Congress Party government, through G.O.s 107 and 108, tried to introduce a policy allocating 50% of seats in government medical colleges to private parties under the guise of a self-financing quota, the ruling NDA coalition government was trying to hand over 100% of the seats to corporate entities. They demanded that the government withdraw its letter and allocate seats in Pulivendula Medical College to local eligible students in the third phase of counselling.

            "content": "MLC and senior YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) leader Botcha Satyanarayana demanded that the NDA announce its stand on privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant(VSP). He alleged that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan, who had promised to protect the VSP from privatisation, are now silent, though two of the blast furnaces were shut down. Addressing a press conference at the YSRCP office here on Sunday, Mr Satyanarayana alleged lack of proper response from the NDA leaders despite two blast furnaces being shut down in the steel plant. He also alleged that the NDA leaders have failed to take any steps so far to protect the steel plant since the formation of their government. Mr. Satyanarayana alleged that the local MLA and the MP have different versions on the issue. He reminded that that during the year 2008 when such a crisis had arisen, former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had spoken to the leaders and written a letter to the Centre ensuring the protection of the steel plant. The former Education Minister also said that VSP was not privatised during the YSRCP government because they had resisted the decision and informed about it to the Centre. Former Minister Gudivada Amarnath said that YSRCP has been fighting to protect the VSP for the past few years, since the plant was a sentiment to the people of Andhra Pradesh. The NDA was trying to showcase debts of the steel plant as losses to privatise it, he alleged. Criticising TDP State president Palla Srinivasa Rao\u2019s statement on not hesitating to resign as MLA if VSP is privatised, Mr Amarnath said that resigning from the posts was not at all a solution. \u201cChief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu should inform the NDA that he would withdraw his support if they privatise the VSP. This is the only solution,\u201d he said.

Companionship, emotional and physical wellbeing, financial security and spiritual health are important for active ageing, he added. Apart from active senior living, there was also assisted living where the person would require assistance for some tasks and continued care. He also pointed out the various benefits that senior residents enjoyed staying at the various Ashiana senior living communities across the country as it had helped them pick up new hobbies such as swimming, snooker and Bharatanatyam. Ashiana would provide safe, comfortable and independent living for senior citizens, said Venkatesan, who has been living in Ashiana Subham for the past four years. The sense of security is very much valued in the community, he added. Published - September 15, 2024 08:23 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "The Madurai Book Fair under way at Tamukkam Convention Centre, here has been attracting a good crowd. People not just from Madurai, but also from neighbouring districts have been coming to the book fair in large numbers. Taking into account the good reception received for the book fair and public holiday on September 17 (Tuesday) on account of Milad-un-Nabi, the book fair organised by Madurai District Administration and the Booksellers and Publishers Association of South India (BAPASI), which was to conclude on September 16, has been extended by one more day. M. Ramprasad, a government employee, said that reading was his hobby and he collects books. He said that he has been coming to the book fair regularly for the last couple of years. This year he had come to buy books for the second time, he said. He said that he has already bought books worth \u20b96,000. Last year he had purchased books for \u20b95,000. His choice of books were Tamil, both fiction and non-fiction. He said that he was interested in Tamil literature. He added that this year the collection of books was more when compared to the previous editions and also the number of stalls had increased. Publishers said that people not just from Madurai, but also from the neighbouring districts have been coming to the book fair and purchasing books. M. Sirajuddin said that the event has become more of a book festival than a book exhibition. People of Madurai and the neighbouring districts have shown their interest in literature and are coming well prepared for the book fair. They read the book reviews and come here and buy the top-rated books and books of their choice. The book fair has attracted children and parents alike and it has reflected in the sales this year, he said. S. Fatima, who has been preparing for competitive examinations, said that there was a good collection of books for everyone and she had purchased the latest books on various topics to prepare for the examinations. However, teachers felt that adding more interactive sessions during the book fair would help the people, particularly the students. A space should be created for discussions and giving guidance on what books children could buy. Also, events such as short films, story recitation, training and discussions should be held as part of the event. Such book fairs should be held in more places, said R. Siva, a teacher. Cultural programmes were also held on the premises as part of the book fair. Published - September 15, 2024 08:22 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Participating in a puja held at the dam site, Minister for Registration and Commercial Taxes P. Moorthy released the shutters in the presence of Theni Collector R.V. Shajeevana, Dindigul Collector M.N. Poongodi and Madurai Collector M.S. Sangeetha. Theni Lok Sabha MP Thanga Tamilselvan and Andipatti MLA A. Maharajan and officials from the Public Works and Revenue Departments were present. The officials said that following the government order, with a combined storage of 8,461 mcft, water was being released from the reservoir, which would benefit farmers in Periyar and Thirumangalam Main Canal for the single crop. For the first 45 days, 1,130 cusecs would be released daily, and for subsequent 75 days, water would be released on turn system taking the total distribution to 120 days depending on inflow. The officials said that 53 acres in Nilakottai in Dindigul district, 5,697 acres in Vadipatti, 24,811 acres in Madurai North, 48,963 acres in Melur, 5,561 acres in Sivaganga and Tirumangalam Main Canal, Usilampatti and Perayur would get water for irrigation. The farmers in Madurai district had urged the government to release water for irrigation last month at the monthly grievance meeting as the combined storage had reached the mandatory levels. However, PWD (WRO) engineers released water only on Sunday. The farmers had pressed for early release as it would enable them to commence preliminary works in the fields with confidence. However, the officials stuck to the practice of September 15, the date of release of water, which has been in vogue from time immemorial.

            "content": "Chhara village in Haryana\u2019s Jhajjar, whose akhadas have gifted the Indian wrestling world with stars such as Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, 19-year-old Prachi Dalal, who was training to become a wrestler, began to realise that the transition from the sport to a government job was not going to be as smooth as it was in the past. Still she stuck to the grind for the past decade for the honour and pride that came with the sport. She, along with her sister Antara Dalal, 18, has been training since they were five. Now, with their pride too hurt by the \u2018ill-treatment\u2019 of wrestlers, who were protesting against then Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Singh accusing him of sexually assaulting athletes, the sisters are seething at the BJP-led Union government. \u201cThe image of Vinesh didi being dragged through the streets is still etched in my memory,\u201d said Ms. Antara. Mr. Prachi said the wrestling community will not forget anytime soon how the government treated the players who bring honour to the country. While the wrestlers\u2019 protest and their \u201cill-treatment by the BJP government\u201d still haunts the wrestlers in Haryana villages, the community says there are other issues too that have been exacerbated by the BJP was elected to power in the State. \u201cEarlier during the Congress government, wrestlers would easily get government jobs. But, in the past decade, we are not getting any jobs. Worse, they have ended our dreams of finding a stable job by introducing contractual schemes like the Agniveer scheme,\u201d said Manav Dalal, a 21-year-old wrestler from Jakhoda. No job, paltry reward In the State\u2019s wrestling hotspots, there is a young and unemployed wrestler like Manav in every second house, said Virendra Arya, a wrestling coach. \u201cWrestling is a demanding sport, and the training does not leave enough head space and energy in young trainees to pursue education with equal zeal. Now if the government fails to provide jobs to these players, then at the end of it all, they neither have a proper employable degree nor a job from the sport,\u201d said Mr. Arya. The sentiments remained the same in Sonipat\u2019s Juan village. Coach Sanjeet Chikkara told The Hindu that many of his students who had joined the army as agniveers, who serve in the Defence forces for four years, left the job since it was not permanent. \u201cOn paper, they say that \u20b930,000 will be paid but my students were getting hardly \u20b920,000. And topping that was the contractual worker-like treatment of the aspirants,\u201d said Mr. Chikkara. 23-year-old Vikas, who has been training in an akhada in Rohtak, said that the present government does not know how to treat players in a dignified manner. \u201cDuring the Congress government we would get cash prizes worth \u20b93 lakh, now, despite the rise in the cost of living and of pursuing the sport, the maximum cash prizes are around one lakh,\u201d says the resident of Sishai. While Manav Dalal complained about the fall in the cash prize amount impacting their ability to pursue the expensive sport, Ajay Chikkara, father of a 15-year-old wrestler in Juan, Sonipat, claimed that even the meagre cash prizes awarded did not reach the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. \u201cA couple of years back my daughter was given a cash prize by the former WFI chairman Brij Bhushan. However despite photographs of it coming in newspaper and a big cheque handed over by him, the prize never reached our account,\u201d said Mr. Chikkara. For the 40-year-old man, training a teenage daughter and son as wrestlers has become difficult which he blames entirely the BJP government for. \u201cBy neither supporting players financially nor meeting the demands of a minimum support price for our crops, the party has ensured that we become incapable of supporting the dreams of our children. Hence, (this time) our support will be for the party that understands the needs of the players,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Tribals of Nagarahole National Park have urged the government to withdraw a recent notification issued by the National Tiger Conservation Authority on relocating people living in the core area of tiger reserves. A memorandum was submitted to the local authorities questioning the rationale of the NTCA notification. The NTCA had written to Chief Wildlife Wardens of 18 States that 64,801 people were living in the core areas and their relocation exercise was being delayed. Incensed with the notification, the tribals staged a demonstration in front of the Forest Department recently and questioned the legality of the notification. They said the relocation is being ostensibly justified because it was to create inviolate space for tigers and conservation but the ulterior motive was to promote tourism and forest land encroachment. The protest held under the aegis of Nagarahole Adivasi Jammapale Right Establishment Committee said that relocation has been conceptualised by urban environmentalists devoid of knowledge of forest-dwelling tribes apart from a section of the NGOs. \u201cThe tribal culture revolves around forests, animals and environment protection and this value system has been inherited from our forefathers and passed on to posterity,\u201d said the agitating tribals. The tribals also questioned the legality of declaring Nagarahole as a tiger reserve without taking the consent of the local gram sabhas amounted to violation of various laws including the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 and Forests Rights Act 2006. A memorandum submitted to the authorities not only called for revocation of the NTCA circular on relocation, but also said that declaring Nagarahole as a tiger reserve was illegal and hence called for the withdrawal of the notification.

            "content": "Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday created a political stir in the national capital after saying he would resign in two days and would demand early polls in Delhi. He vowed not to sit in CM's chair till people give him a \"certificate of honesty\". Kejriwal was released on bail from Tihar on Friday in the excise policy scam case. \"Delhi elections are due in February but I demand that elections in the national capital be held in November with Maharashtra. I will only sit on CM's chair after people give me a certificate of honesty. I want to give 'agnipariksha' after coming out of jail,\" he said while addressing Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders and workers at the party office in the national capital. Delhi Assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel met Kejriwal at the residence of Delhi CM hours after his announcement which is seen as an exercise to find the next chief minister. Now, the million-dollar question is who will be the next chief minister of Delhi? AAP national convenor and his party colleagues maintained suspense over the name of Kejriwal's successor. Kejriwal asserted that he would hold a meeting of AAP MLAs in the next couple of days and a party leader would take over as chief minister. Kejriwal during his speech cleared that former Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also an accused in the alleged Delhi excise scam, will not take the charge. \"I will become chief minister and Manish Sisodia deputy chief minister only when people say we are honest,\" Kejriwal said. Though AAP did not give any hint about the name of the next chief minister, there are a few names which are creating buzz in the power corridor. Delhi minister Atishi, who holds multiple key portfolios, including Finance Ministry and Education Ministry, is a front-runner for the CM post. In the absence of Delhi CM Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, she carried forward the government works. She emerged as a troubleshooter during student protests following the Rajinder Nagar tragedy. Atishi had been also vocal in the Swati Maliwal assault row. She led a protest during a water shortage in Delhi and opened a front against the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Haryana government. Saurabh Bharadwaj is also considered as a close aide of Kejriwal. He also holds multiple portfolios, including the Health and Industries and Urban Development departments. Bharadwaj, along with Atishi, became the face of the Delhi government in the absence of the AAP duo - Kejriwal and Sisodia. Gopal Rai is one of AAP leaders who remained as Cabinet colleague of Kejriwal since 2015. Rai has environment ministry which is a crucial portfolio considering Delhi is a highly vulnerable city in terms of reeling under the pollution menace. Gahlot, who also holds multiple portfolios - Administrative Reforms, Transport, Revenue, Law, Justice and Legislative Affairs, Women and Child Development, is another big name in the CM race. Meanwhile, the BJP described Kejriwal's announcement of resigning from the post of Delhi chief minister as a \"confession of crime\" and wondered if he offered to quit the post because of an infight within his party. The saffron party also termed Kejriwal's move a \"drama\" and claimed he was playing an \"emotional card\" in a bid to make a virtue out of necessity as the Supreme Court by granting him a \"conditional bail\" in the excise policy graft case, restricted him from entering his office and signing any file.",

            "content": "The Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry is planning to introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)-powered integrated dashboard with the capability to analyse recent news stories for forecasting emerging trends. The tool is expected to enhance the Ministry\u2019s ability to swiftly respond to such trends. An AI&ML-based platform for multilingual translation and voice localisation will also be developed to facilitate efficient public dissemination of information about government initiatives. The Ministry has requested for an Expression of Interest (EoI) by the interested parties for the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of the integrated dashboard. \u201cIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving media landscape, staying ahead of emerging news trends is essential for effective communication and public engagement. By leveraging AI and ML technologies, the Ministry aims to deploy a cutting-edge tool that can accurately predict future media trends based on patterns identified in historical data,\u201d said the EoI request, adding that the dashboard would provide insights for implementing corrective measures and devising citizen-oriented communication strategies. The proposed tool is aimed at improving the Ministry\u2019s strategic decision-making and communication strategies. \u201cBy anticipating emerging trends, the Ministry can effectively engage citizens and counter misinformation. Its proactive nature allows for swift interventions, enhancing credibility, and public trust,\u201d said the EoI request. Key features Key features of the multilingual content-supported tool will include historical data analysis, language analysis, real-time awareness, customisable alerts, social media integration for observing discussions, engagement, trends, data visualisation, security measures for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality, report generation, contextual sentiment analysis, and AI-enabled decision support system providing options for implementing countermeasures or corrective actions based on media feedback. The dashboard is expected to have the facility of updates four times a day with all the four media coverage (print, electronic, online/digital, and social); scanning of more than 100 print and over 4,000 online publications based on keywords and over 200 YouTube accounts covering 16 major regional languages; topic, sector, ministry, trend-wise data segregation and report generation; and separate feeds for Editorials and Op-Eds. The second EoI request is for the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of the AI&ML-based platform that will have capabilities to translate, transcribe, transliterate, and localise content in at least 12 Indian languages: Hindi, Bangla, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Urdu, and Assamese. Knowledge of any of the additional 10 languages: Kashmiri, Konkani, Manipuri, Nepali, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Bodo, Santhali, Maithili and Dogri, will be an advantage for any applicant agency. The platform will have a provision for adding any Indian language on a need basis. \u201c...the New Media Wing (NMW) of the Ministry of I&B intends to hire an agency with a portfolio of successfully implementing AI-ML-based digital platforms for multilingual translation and voice localisation (text-to-text, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech) services,\u201d said the EoI request. Through the platform, the Ministry intends to streamline dissemination of information in various Indian languages. The work contract, to be awarded after following the due process, will be valid for an initial period of one year, which may be extended for a further period of one year. Listing the specifications, the Ministry said they should facilitate user-friendly interactions, including video and text uploads with the capability to produce translated content in downloadable formats. The platform will support both online and offline modes of data input, accommodating legacy data from diverse physical and digital media sources. It will have \u201ccomprehensive user interface for uploading, downloading, and editing translated content, complemented by mechanisms for leaving comments and feedback\u201d. To ensure seamless integration, speech-to-speech translation will synchronise with original files via timestamping, with subtitles for video files. \u201cThe AI platform should be developed as an application layer over and above Bhashini\u2019s AI models, which enables language translations (text-text, speech-speech, text-speech, and speech-text) to be leveraged by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and other Ministries of the Government of India,\u201d said the EoI request, adding that the platform should be designed to uphold stringent data protection measures while accommodating potential growth and expansion, also ensuring security and scalability.

            "description": "Tourism Department plans to develop these places as options to Hampi, Bengaluru, Madikeri and Kushalnagar",
            "content": "With the number of tourists visiting Karnataka increasing rapidly after the lull caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, popular destinations have become overcrowded. In response, the Tourism Department has identified alternative sites in the same clusters to redirect visitor traffic. Anegundi in Koppal district has been identified as a potential alternative to Hampi in Vijayanagara district. Similarly, in Kodagu district, Virajapet has been suggested as an alternative to Madikeri and Kushalnagara, while Ramanagara is being considered as an option for Bengaluru. \u201cWe have identified these alternative destinations based on directives from the Government of India. We observed that certain destinations have exceeded their carrying capacities, so we selected nearby locations that can offer similar experiences. This will also serve as an opportunity to promote lesser-known destinations,\u201d said Salma Fahim, Principal Secretary of the Tourism Department, in an interview with The Hindu . Rural tourism Officials said Anegundi, while offering a heritage and cultural experience similar to Hampi, can also introduce visitors to community-led rural tourism. Virajapet, with its scenic beauty, coffee plantations, hills, and natural landscapes, has room for development, as it is less developed compared to Madikeri. Ramanagara, they noted, has the potential to attract adventure tourism with opportunities for rock climbing and more resorts and homestays. \u201cMadikeri is overcrowded, and we can provide a similar experience in Virajapet. Ramanagara also has a lot to offer, such as rock climbing and beautiful landscapes. Moreover, Bengaluru\u2019s traffic makes it difficult for tourists to travel, but that won\u2019t be an issue in Ramanagara,\u201d Ms. Fahim added. Infra development While experts commend the initiative, they stress the importance of infrastructure development and ecological conservation before officially promoting these alternative sites as tourist destinations. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea overall, as places like Chikkamagaluru and Kodagu are overwhelmed with tourists. Infrastructure development should be a priority. For example, even in Hampi, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, it took a long time to establish basic infrastructure like toilets,\u201d said Sanjar Imam, President of the Karnataka Tourism Forum. \u201cDevelopment should be done ethically, keeping the ecology in mind. With newer destinations, new accommodation options may also emerge, leaving older ones vacant and creating pressure elsewhere. All stakeholders should be consulted,\u201d he said. The Department is also focused on developing these sites once they are approved. Plans include building infrastructure, increasing capacity, and improving connectivity. \u201cOnce these aspects are in place and our agents begin promoting the alternative destinations, tourists will naturally start visiting them,\u201d Ms. Fahim stated.

            "content": "Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) Head of Sales & Communications Animesh Mishra has said under the leadership of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, Andhra Pradesh has emerged as a pioneer in Energy Efficiency (EE) initiatives and the State\u2019s proactive adoption of EESL programs earned it global recognition in 2016-17. Speaking at the 25th Silver Jubilee CII Awards Anniversary function held in Hyderabad recently, where EESL was awarded the \u2018Impact Player of the Year 2023-24\u2019 in recognition of its achievements in the area, during the 25th Silver Jubilee Anniversary of the CII Awards, held in Hyderabad. The award celebrates energy efficiency achievements across diverse industries, recognising EESL\u2019s revolutionary UJALA initiative. Mr. Mishra said Mr. Naidu\u2019s commitment to sustainability had established A.P. as a role model for India in implementing the Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) scheme, the domestic efficient lighting program. The State has consistently demonstrated its commitment to sustainable development by embracing the EESL\u2019s EE programs, positioning itself as a front-runner on the Energy Efficiency Index. Bureau of Energy Efficiency Secretary Milind Deora emphasised the need for proactive States, including A.P. and Telangana, to focus on EE measures on a sustainable basis, which is crucial for economic development.

The bodies of the three hostages, Corporal Nik Beizer, Sergeant Ron Sherman and French-Israeli Elia Toledano, were brought back to Israel in December following their deaths the previous month. \u201cThe findings of the investigation suggest a high probability that the three were killed as a result of a byproduct of an IDF air strike, during the elimination of the Hamas Northern Brigade commander, Ahmed Ghandour, on November 10th, 2023,\u201d the military said in a statement, referring to the three captives. \u201cThis assessment is based on the location of where their bodies were found in relation to the strike\u2019s impact, performance analysis of the strike, intelligence findings, the results of the pathological reports, and the conclusions of the Forensic Medicine Institute.\u201d \u201cThis is a high-probability assessment based on all of the available information, but it is not possible to definitively determine the circumstances of their deaths,\u201d the military said. The bodies of the three hostages were recovered on December 14. The military said its investigation revealed that the three captives had been held in a tunnel complex from which Ghandour operated. \u201cAt the time of the strike, the IDF did not have information about the presence of hostages in the targeted compound,\u201d the military said. \u201cFurthermore, there was information suggesting that they were located elsewhere, and thus the area was not designated as one with suspected presence of hostages.\u201d Published - September 15, 2024 07:53 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Israel-Palestine Conflict / Israel / Palestine / war",

Police said six students came to their classmate\u2019s house in Vaduvurpatti for a house-warming ceremony. After attending the function, the boys, who were studying Plus Two in a private school in Jothipuram, went for a swim. When three boys identified as Arunkumar, Nikil and Andrews went missing, others raised alarm. Those in the vicinity tried to rescue the boys and failed and informed Fire and Rescue Services. Firefighters from Pettai and Cheranmahadevi stations rushed to the spot and retrieved the three bodies. An officer said the three boys could have gone into the deep side of the stream and drowned. Muneerpallam police sent the three bodies to Government Hospital for post-mortem. Further investigation was on.

            "content": "A sub-committee of the National Task Force, formed by the Supreme Court in response to the rape and murder of a trainee doctor at R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, met recently to discuss better working conditions for healthcare professionals. Key issues addressed during the meeting included enforcement of the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Act within medical institutions and regulation of junior doctors\u2019 duty hours. The committee discussed the importance of establishing a 24x7 helpline for medical professionals, alongside emergency distress facilities at every medical institution. Experts proposed a significant shift in working hours, suggesting a 12-hour duty instead of the current 24-hour shifts, which often stretch to 36 hours. They also recommended a separate duty off, distinct from the weekly off days. \u201cWe advocate six-hour workdays instead of the existing eight-hour days, with a maximum of 48 working hours per week,\u201d said Kiran Madhala of the All India Federation of Government Doctors\u2019 Association (AIFGDA). Dr. Kiran, currently a professor of Anaesthesia at Gandhi Hospital, and national coordinator of medical teachers for AIFGDA, highlighted the need for reforms to ensure better work-life balance. Additional topics of discussion were provision of separate duty rooms for male and female doctors, baggage screening for everyone entering hospital premises, and the deployment of police personnel within hospitals to enhance safety. Pay-related concerns for government doctors nationwide were also raised. The committee discussed the need for government doctors to receive pay scales equivalent to AIIMS staff, with additional compensation for those working in remote areas, along with decent pension schemes. Dr. Kiran further suggested that state health departments should recruit faculty based on the specific needs of each hospital or institution, rather than adhering strictly to the guidelines set by the National Medical Commission (NMC). The members of the meeting were Pratima Murthy, Director of NIMHANS; Padma Srivastava (NTF member); Atul Goel, Director General of Health Services; Vandana Jain, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; Sarita Beri, Director of Lady Hardinge Medical College; and G. Kausalya, Director of Rural Health Training Centre, among others. Published - September 15, 2024 07:50 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

            "content": "Scores of tourists visiting the Keshava Temple at Somanathpur, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are being routinely prevented from photographing the iconic monument in contravention of the rules of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), since the last few months. The security guards make it a point to inform the tourists with cameras that photography is not allowed before letting them in after checking the entry tickets. When challenged to provide the notification banning photography, they cite orders from \u2018\u2019higher authorities\u2019\u2019 without producing any evidence. While a majority of the tourists comply with these \u201corders\u201d, quite a few argue or return disappointed. Abhishek, a tourist from Bengaluru, shared his experience that took place with the local authorities on Sunday at Somanathapur. He was prevented from taking snaps of the monuments and when he insisted that there was no such rule, the local staff said he could take the photographs \u201cwithout giving any pose\u201d. Incidentally, there are no restrictions in photographing the Chennakeshava temple at Belur or Hoyslaeshwara temple at Halebidu \u2013 both of which are UNESCO sites along with Somanathapur Keshava temple. There are restrictions only in photographing the deities as they are both functional temples. However, tourists are allowed to click images of the exquisite carvings inside the temple and the guards gently remind public that photographing the deities should be avoided. Recently, the State Department of Tourism concluded a visit Mysuru programme where in it identified some of the social media influences and took them to iconic places in and around the region including Keshava temple at Somanathapur, as part of its tourism promotion drive. But when one of the media photographer from Mysuru who went to Somanthapur to take a few snaps of the event \u2013 ironically conducted to ensure wide publicity for the monument - he was prevented by the security personnel who demanded to see his identification card and insisted on securing permission before photographing the monument. When contacted, N.K. Pathak, Regional Director, ASI, south zone said there was no such rule preventing photography of the monuments though there are restrictions only if there are paintings inside. But for the use of tripod one has seek permission from the ASI authorities, he added. When pointed out the restrictions being imposed at some of the ASI sites such as Keshava temple at Somanathapur, Pathak said it may have been imposed by staff recently deployed there and unaware of the rules. Staff posted at various ASI monuments would be sensitised to the rules regarding photographing the monuments, he added.

            "content": "Tiruppur City Corporation is set to introduce an Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) system for real-time monitoring of domestic water consumption in two pilot zones, as part of the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 scheme, which aims to provide 24/7 water supply to households. \u201cWe have completed almost 90% of the pipeline installation work. The process of installing AMR devices for 8,000 household pipe connections in water zones 30 and 50, under the purview of administrative zones II and III respectively, will begin in a week\u2019s time,\u201d said Corporation Commissioner Pavankumar G. Giriyappanavar. The AMR system will transmit water consumption data to a central database via RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), eliminating the need for passive water storage in containers. Notably, this new system will promote responsible water use among residents, enabling them to monitor their own consumption. Awareness programmes are also planned to educate residents on the new water supply system, the Commissioner added. The Corporation will be able to detect excessive water usage from the central database. Commercial and industrial establishments will be required to install additional meters based on their consumption levels. Data receptors placed at intervals of 1.5 km will help detect excessive usage, and any pilferage along the pipeline will be identified through the pressure-based RFID system. As a City Corporation, the local body is required to supply 135 litres of water per capita per day. Based on the success of the pilot programme, further funding will be sought from the government to expand the installation of AMR meters to other areas in phases. Currently, residents are charged at slab rates for water consumption, but the rates under the new system will be decided at the next Corporation Council meeting, the Commissioner noted.

            "description": "Citing an apparent reference to disgraced IAS probationer Puja Khedkar, CIC rules that it is in the public interest to disclose such information publicly upfront; dismisses Railways concerns about privacy for employees",
            "content": "The Central Information Commission (CIC) has advised the Thiruvananthapuram division of Southern Railway to disclose the list of employees who have secured jobs under the category for people with disabilities, amid concerns about fake disability certificates. The CIC ruling came in response to a Right to Information petition filed by M. Aravind who sought the names of such employees, along with certified copies of their disability certificates, expressing concerns about fraudulent practices in the recruitment process. In his order, Information Commissioner Vinod Kumar Tiwari mentioned the recent case of an All India Service officer who was dismissed from service, in an apparent reference to IAS probationer Puja Khedkar , who allegedly submitted false certificates to gain benefits meant for people with benchmark disabilities, and those from other backward classes, in order to clear the civil services exam. She has denied the allegations. In the light of such incidents, Mr. Tiwari emphasised the need to publicly disclose the information requested, to ensure transparency and probity. Privacy concerns Initially, Southern Railway\u2019s Chief Public Information Officer (CPIO) had refused to release the requested information, citing concerns about privacy and the lack of larger public interest. The CPIO argued that sharing personal details of employees could lead to an unwarranted invasion of privacy. Mr. Aravind contended that many candidates had joined the Railways through fraudulent means, including the submission of fake disability certificates. He expressed frustration that the Railways was unwilling to even share the number of employees with disabilities. He referred to a previous CIC order, which stated that \u201cthe copy of a document reflecting the disability and its extent, issued by an appropriate authority, cannot be withheld on the grounds of personal information.\u201d After considering the arguments from both sides, Mr. Tiwari concluded that no malafide intent had been established on the part of the CPIO. The CIC\u2019s role, he explained, was limited to determining whether the information had been denied due to unreasonable causes or with malafide intentions. Based on the facts and the CPIO\u2019s submissions, the Commission found that an appropriate and timely response had been provided. Public interest However, Mr. Tiwari recognised the gravity of the issue raised by the complainant. He noted that public scrutiny of the list of individuals claiming benefits under special categories had become essential, especially given the recent media attention to cases of fraud. The appointment of ineligible individuals deprives deserving candidates of their rightful opportunities, he said. Even if such ineligible appointments were later revoked, the delay in action could result in some candidates losing their chance for employment due to age restrictions. Mr. Tiwari pointed out that similar public disclosure practices, such as State governments\u2019 publication of the list of families living below the poverty line, were already in place to promote transparency. Invoking powers under Section 25(5) of the RTI Act, Mr. Tiwari recommended that public authorities conform to the provisions and spirit of the Act. He issued an advisory to the Southern Railways CPIO, calling for the proactive disclosure of the list of candidates selected under the disability category, along with related notifications and orders. This would be in line with the suo moto disclosure requirements under Section 4 of the Act, he said. The Information Commissioner also directed the First Appellate Authority to present a copy of the order to the competent authority for compliance.

            "description": "Amendments proposed for close to a dozen legislations in this direction",
            "content": "The State government has initiated the process for making amendments to several legislations enabling the smooth functioning of Hyderabad Disaster Response and Assets Monitoring and Protection Authority (HYDRAA). Several departments are learnt to have prepared the draft of amendments required for close to a dozen legislations under their purview and sent them to the Law department for its consent. The exercise was necessitated following questions raised over the powers conferred by the government on the authority to clear encroachments of tanks, lakes and nalas, which was leading to flooding of vulnerable areas during rains. According to officials, amendments are being brought out to legislations, including Land Encroachment Act, Land Revenue Act, Municipalities Act, Panchayat Raj Act and WALTA Act, to confer powers on HYDRA to take action against encroachments. \u201cPowers delegated under an Act passed by the State Legislature cannot be further delegated to other departments. Exercise is said to be underway to promulgate an Ordinance amending the Acts so that there are no questions about the functioning of HYDRA,\u201d a law expert said. The legal expert, however, favoured comprehensive legislation as it would avoid scope for legal complications in the functioning of the authority, a first-of-its-kind initiative by the government. Referring to cases filed in the High Court against HYDRAA, he said the authority was acting as an enforcement agency at the behest of these departments as could be seen from the presence of officials at the time of demolitions. \u201cThis is an authority agency created through the executive order on the lines of Planning Commission, Law Commission and other bodies,\u201d he explained.

            "content": "The 54th GST Council meeting on September 9 decided to set up a GoM to examine and review the present tax structure of GST on life and medical insurance. New Delhi: The GST Council on Sunday constituted a 13-member Group of Ministers (GoM) to suggest GST rate on premiums of various health and life insurance products and submit its report by October 30. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary is the convenor of the GoM. The members of the panel include members from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. The 54th GST Council meeting on September 9 decided to set up a GoM to examine and review the present tax structure of GST on life and medical insurance. A final call by the Council on the taxation of insurance premiums is likely to be taken in the next meeting in November based on the GoM report. Currently, 18 per cent of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is levied on insurance premiums. The Terms of Reference (ToR) of the panel also include suggesting tax rate of health/medical insurance including individual, group, family floater and other medical insurance for various categories like senior citizens, middle class, persons with mental illness. Also, suggest tax rates on life insurance, including term insurance, life insurance with investment plans whether individual or group and re-insurance. \"The GoM is to submit its report by October 30,\" 2024,\" said the Office Memorandum issued by the GST Council Secretariat on the Constitution of GoM on Life and Health insurance. Some opposition-ruled states, including West Bengal, had demanded complete exemption of GST on health and life insurance premiums, while some other states were in favour of lowering the tax to 5 per cent. Even Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had in July written to Finance Miniter Nirmala Sitharaman on the issue saying \"levying GST on life insurance premium amounts to levying tax on the uncertainties of life.\" In 2023-24, the centre and states collected Rs 8,262.94 crore through GST on health insurance premiums, while Rs 1,484.36 crore was collected on account of GST on health reinsurance premiums. Sitharaman in her reply to a discussion on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha in August had said that 75 per cent of the GST collected goes to states and the Opposition members should ask their state finance ministers to bring the proposal to the GST Council.",

He further directed the Revenue and Police departments to increase security personnel and meticulously mark danger zones. There are nine major waterfalls across eight mandals under the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) Paderu region, which generally receives good tourist inflow throughout the year, especially during winters, including Katika, Sariya in Ananthagiri, Chaparai in Dumbriguda, Kothapalli in G. Madugula, Yerravaram in Chintapalli, Gadigummi/Valasampeta waterfalls in Koyyuru, Donigummala in G.K. Veedhi, Gangalamma waterfalls in Hukumpeta. In addition to these, several others in the interior areas of the Agency are also tourist favourites. Among all waterfalls, Sariya waterfalls has turned the most dangerous for tourists so far. Earlier, multiples drownings were also reported from Chaparai waterfall, but its facelift by the ITDA has mitigated the issue. As per police records, at least 40 persons, mostly tourists, have died at the Sariya waterfalls over the past few years. \u201cEarlier the drownings were frequent at Sariya waterfalls. However, we have initiated measures last year, which finally resulted in gradual decline of deaths by drowning. After January 1, this is second drowning incident in Sariya,\u201d said Ananthagiri Sub Inspector (SI) K. Ramu. \u201cEven though we have arranged fencing around the danger zone, many youths cross the fence, trek to prohibited parts of the waterfall, where they accidentally slip and drown,\u201d he added, while highlighting that as per some swimmers, Sariya has whirlpools, which causes the drownings. Bodies traced The bodies of two youth who were drowned in Sariya waterfalls on Saturday were traced on Sunday afternoon. As per the police, L. Sai Kumar (32) from Vizianagaram had accidentally drowned while swimming. Deepak Kumar (27), who attempted to rescue him, had also drowned. Their bodies were traced on Sunday afternoon.

            "content": "A special court gave the CBI three-day custody of Sandip Ghosh, ex-principal of R.G. Kar Medical College & Hospital, and Abhijit Mondal, former station house officer at Tala Police Station. A special court on Sunday granted the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) a three-day custody of Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of R.G. Kar Medical College & Hospital, and Abhijit Mondal, the former station house officer of Tala Police Station. They were arrested in connection with the horrific rape and murder of a junior doctor last month. The court agreed with the CBI counsel that although Mondal was not directly involved in the case, he is accused of tampering with evidence and impeding the initial investigation when it was under the jurisdiction of Kolkata Police. The Calcutta High Court later transferred the case to the CBI. On Sunday, the CBI counsel revealed that investigators found crucial leads regarding a phone call between Ghosh and Mondal on the morning of August 9, coinciding with the discovery of the junior doctor's body in the seminar hall of R.G. Kar Medical College & Hospital. The counsel insisted on the necessity of an in-depth probe into the conversation between Ghosh and Mondal that morning, warranting their custody for further interrogation. The CBI counsel also pointed out instances of negligent investigation by Kolkata Police during the early stages of the inquiry, noting that the police initially misinformed the victim's parents, labeling the death as a suicide, and were slow to seize items as evidence. Ultimately, the judge concurred with the CBI counsel and ordered a three-day CBI remand for Ghosh and Mondal. Mondal was detained by the CBI on Saturday night after a seven-hour interrogation. Ghosh, previously arrested for financial misconduct at the institution, is in judicial custody and was also implicated in the rape and murder case.",

            "content": "According to the latest data from the RBI released this week, India's foreign currency assets (FCA), the largest component of forex reserves, were at USD 604,144 points. New Delhi: India's foreign exchange reserves have been rising for months now, hitting several all-time highs. The forex kitty increased by USD 66 billion so far this year and is currently at USD 689.235 billion. This buffer of foreign exchange reserves helps insulate domestic economic activity from global shocks. According to the latest data from the RBI released this week, India's foreign currency assets (FCA), the largest component of forex reserves, were at USD 604,144 points. Gold reserves are currently worth USD 61.988 billion. As per estimates, India's foreign exchange reserves are now sufficient to cover about a year of projected imports. In the calendar year 2023, India added about USD 58 billion to its foreign exchange reserves. In contrast, India's forex reserves saw a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion in 2022. Forex reserves, or foreign exchange reserves (FX reserves), are assets held by a nation's central bank or monetary authority. Foreign exchange reserves are generally held in reserve currencies, typically the US Dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling. The RBI closely monitors the foreign exchange markets and intervenes only to maintain orderly market conditions, aiming to contain excessive volatility in the exchange rate without reference to any pre-determined target level or band. The RBI frequently intervenes in the market through liquidity management, including the sale of dollars, to prevent a steep depreciation of the rupee. A decade ago, the Indian Rupee was one of the most volatile currencies in Asia. However, it has since become one of the most stable. This transformation is a testament to India's growing economic strength and effective management by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI has been strategically buying dollars when the rupee is strong and selling when it is weak. This intervention smooths out large fluctuations in the rupee's value, contributing to its stability. A less volatile rupee makes Indian assets more attractive to investors, as they can expect better performance with more predictability.",

            "content": "Yash Dubey gets out in one of the most unfortunate ways in cricket during Duleep Trophy match. On Day 4 of the second round of the Duleep Trophy at the Rural Development Trust Stadium in Anantapur, Yash Dubey of India D experienced a tough dismissal. India D was chasing a daunting target of 488 runs in their fourth innings. Dubey, along with Ricky Bhui, had steadied the innings with a crucial 100-run partnership after the early dismissal of Atharva Taide for a duck. As they began to build their innings, Dubey and Bhui looked to be in control. However, their partnership was abruptly ended due to a run-out incident. During the first session of Day 4, Bhui drove Shams Mulani's delivery down the ground to secure a single. At the non-striker\u2019s end, Dubey failed to get his bat out of the way in time as the ball deflected towards the stumps. Mulani seized the opportunity, quickly collected the ball, and broke the stumps, leading to Dubey\u2019s dismissal. He was found short of the crease and was out for 37 off 94 balls.

Resuming day four at 309 for seven, India B were dismissed for 332 in 108 overs with Kamboj cleaning up the tail to add to his overnight five wickets. India B skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran remained unbeaten on 157 off 286 balls. India C, who amassed 525 in the first innings, reached 128 for four in their second innings and that was the moment where players to decided to shake hands. India C got three points for the first innings lead, pushing them to top with nine points in two games while India B got a solitary point for a draw. Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad (62) stuck his second fifty of the match while Rajat Patidar was dismissed in the 40s for the second consecutive time in the game. It was only the third time in Duleep Trophy history that a pacer had taken eight wickets or more in an innings. Kamboj was deservingly named player of the match. It was the first ever five wicket haul for the Haryana cricketer in his 15th first class game. He has played for Mumbai Indians in the IPL this season. Another cricketer who made a statement in the game was Ishan Kishan, who smashed 111 off 126 balls in his return to red ball cricket. Brief scores: India C: 525 all in 124.1 overs and 128/4 in 37 overs (Ruturaj Gaikwad 62; Rahul Chahar 2/8 vs India B: 332 all out in 108 overs(Abhimanyu Easwaran 157 not out, Narayan Jagadeesan 70; Anshul Kamboj 8/69 in 27.5 overs).

            "content": "Hours after Delhi Chief Minister and AAP National Convener Arvind Kejriwal announced his decision to resign from the top ministerial position, mere days after being released on bail in the Delhi Excise Policy case, social worker Anna Hazare, reacted to the development. Speaking to the media from his hometown in Ralegan-Siddhi, the social activist mentioned that he had warned Kejriwal not to enter politics and instead to continue serving society, which he believed would bring greater happiness. He said, \"I repeatedly told Kejriwal not to go into politics. Serve society, and you will become a great man. We were together for many years, and during that time, I often told him that social service gives happiness.\" Hazare continued, \"Increase happiness, but he did not take those words to heart. Today, what was bound to happen has happened. How would I know what is truly in his heart?\" Significantly, it was not the first time that Anna Hazare had reacted to development concerning to Kejriwal. Earlier, the social activist had reacted to Kejriwal's arrest in the Delhi Excise Policy case, where he expressed his disappointment. At that time, Hazare had said, \"I am very upset that Arvind Kejriwal, who worked with me and raised his voice against liquor, is now making liquor policies. His arrest is because of his own deeds.\" Meanwhile, it is pertinent to note that the statement by the social activisit comes after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that he will resign from his post in two days and will demand early elections in the national capital. He vowed not to occupy the CM's chair until the people give him a \"certificate of honesty.\" Kejriwal, who was released on bail from Tihar Jail in the excise policy corruption case, stated, \"I will only sit in the CM's chair after people give me a certificate of honesty. I want to undergo an 'agnipariksha' after coming out of jail.\" \"Until the elections are held, there will be someone else as CM. Both Manish Sisodia and I will not take up the position of Chief Minister,\" Kejriwal added.",

The award show will be hosted by the famous father-son duo Eugene Levy and Dan Levy on September 15 (local time). Lewis, known for his brilliant work on Schitt's Creek, will present the event live on ABC. This year, FX's 'Shogun' leads the nominations with 25 nominations, with 'The Bear' following close behind. The 76th Primetime Emmy Awards will be telecast live on Sunday, September 15, 2024, at 8:00 pm ET (5:00 pm PT). The prestigious event is scheduled to take place at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles, California. Interestingly, this is the second ceremony of the year as the previous show in 2023 was postponed due to the twin attacks in Hollywood. Those who don't have cable can watch the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards using services like Sling TV, fuboTV and Hulu Plus Live TV. In India, the event will be streamed exclusively on Lionsgate Play on September 16 at 5:30 am IST. However, due to the ongoing dispute between DIRECTV and Disney, DIRECTV users may face difficulties in accessing the ABC feed until a solution is found before the ceremony. This year's Emmy Awards will feature a star-studded lineup of presenters including Kathy Bates, Matt Bomer, Nicola Coughlan, Billy Crystal, Viola Davis, Colin Farrell and Selena Gomez. Other notable names on the Television Academy's official list include Steve Martin, Jane Lynch, Christine Baranski, Meredith Baxter and Candice Bergen. The only ones in the race for the prestigious award are 'Murders in the Building', 'Slow Horses', '3 Body Problem' and 'Baby Reindeer'.",

            "content": "Maruti Suzuki reported a 10 per cent increase in bookings in Kerala before Onam and deliveries in Maharashtra and Karnataka rose similarly on the first day of Ganesh Chaturthi. New Delhi: After sluggish sales in the first five months of this fiscal, automobiles and consumer electronics companies saw some surge in demand due to discounts and promotional offers during the ongoing Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam festivals, multiple reports said. \"In view of festivals like Onam, Navratri, Diwali, and Dussehra, electronics, automobile and smartphone companies are offering discounts of up to 30 percent to customers,\" the reports stated. Maruti Suzuki reported a 10 per cent increase in bookings in Kerala before Onam and deliveries in Maharashtra and Karnataka rose similarly on the first day of Ganesh Chaturthi. Two-wheeler sales surged by 15 to 16 per cent during Onam. During the festive season, vehicle sales may increase by 15 per cent from the average of 3,30,000 units in the first five months of the current financial year. Sales of consumer electronics may see an increase of 7 to 8 per cent compared to last year. Sales of frost-free refrigerators increased by 15 per cent during Onam. However, sales of single-door refrigerators have declined by 6 to 7 per cent. Sales of fully automatic machines have increased by 12 to 13 per cent, while those of semi-automatic machines have increased by 4 to 5 per cent. Earlier a report said that the upcoming festive season in India is likely to see the creation of up to 10 lakh jobs with a notable surge in gig and female workforce participation. Many industries are gearing up for a rise in hiring, including retail, hotel, e-commerce, logistics, consumer goods, banking, financial services, insurance (BFSI), and retail, according to NLB Services, a technology and digital talent solutions provider. Among these industries, e-commerce will see the highest demand with a 22 per cent increase over last year.",

            "content": "Mufti said that her party is not fighting for roads and other amenities only but also to keep the Kashmir issue alive and seek its redressal. Jammu And Kashmir News: As Jammu and Kashmir gears up for Assembly Polls after a decade, former Chief Minister and People's Democratic Party (PDP) President Mehbooba Mufti lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said that the saffron party should be ashamed that despite beating the drum of normalcy for years, they couldn't hold assembly polls in the district for the last ten years. \u201cBJP was claiming that situation in Kashmir is on track, but they conducted elections after 10 years people are suffocated and want their own government,\" she said. The PDP chief said her party is not fighting for roads and other amenities only but also to keep the Kashmir issue alive and seek its redressal. \u201cEveryone is fighting elections for sake of election, but we don\u2019t fight elections just for development but are fighting it so that Kashmir issue is solved. We were in the past pressuring this agenda and will remain fighting for that; it\u2019s very necessary,\u201d she said. Speaking on the job situation in Jammu and Kashmir, she said, \u201cWe will fill one lakh job vacancies on fast track, regularize 60 thousand daily wagers, and try multinational companies here so that jobs are created\". Hitting back at Prime Minister Modi over his accusations that three families have destroyed Jammu and Kashmir, Mufti said, \u201cHe is the same PM who promised 15 lakh rupees for every citizen and two crore jobs, which was a total lie. Now what other things he said people can judge it well.\u201d Assembly polls are set to be held in the 90-member J&K Assembly after a decade on September 18, September 25, and October 1. The counting of votes will take place on October 8. Earlier this week, Mufti said that her party is the only party that can fight the onslaught of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on several issues related to the Union Territory, including identity, resources, and jobs. She said that when PDP was in power in the J&K, it took the people of the Union Territory, especially south Kashmir, out of the difficult times when the region witnessed the worst impact of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) and Special Task Force (STF). While speaking to reporters in South Kashmir's Anantnag district, the PDP chief said, \"For us, the challenge is the work done by the party in our previous tenure, for the development of J-K, especially in south Kashmir. Can we do better than that? That is our challenge.\" \"The PDP represents the sentiments of the people of J-K and talks about them. The PDP is the only party that can fight the BJP's onslaught on our identity, land, and jobs,\" she stated.",

            "content": "Masaba Gupta highlights her father's struggle with racism during his cricket career and criticizes societal prejudices by sharing personal experiences of bias faced during her pregnancy. Mumbai: Fashion designer-actress Masaba Gupta, who is known for \u2018Masaba Masaba\u2019, has spoken about how her father, the legendary cricketer, Sir Viv Richards, faced racism during the peak of his career. Masaba feels that racism is a societal evil that will continue to affect lives until we fight against it collectively. She spoke with Faye D'Souza, and said: \u201cNow I know why my father felt so strongly about it (racism) for so many years. Till today, if you ask him, he'll have tears in his eyes or he'll have this rage in him, where he will answer with a lot of pride. He grew up in the worst of times. He played professional cricket at a time when the colour of your skin came in the way of your ability to move ahead in the world. It's there, everywhere. It'll keep being spoken of until we fight for it, and it's only going to happen if everybody fights for it.\u201d Masaba is the daughter of actress Neena Gupta and Sir Vivian Richards, the latter is a former Antiguan cricketer who represented the West Indies cricket team between 1974 and 1991. He usually came to bat at number three. Sir Vivian Richards is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and has been a part of the West Indies squads which won the 1975 Cricket World Cup and 1979 Cricket World Cup and finished as runners-up in the 1983 Cricket World Cup against the Kapil Dev-led team India. Masaba also spoke about the pregnancy advice that she often gets on how to give birth to a \u201clighter\u201d child. She said: \"It happened to me just yesterday that somebody came up to me for some pre-natal something, telling me, \u2018You must eat a rasgulla every day' because your kid has to turn out lighter than you. And then, 15 days before that, I was getting another pre-natal massage, because that's what I do, and she (her masseuse) said to me, \u2018Aap na doodh liya karo (you must consume milk). Saawla nahi hona chahiye, nahi honi chahiye, whatever (your child must not turn out dusky).' It was said with so much innocence. You have no choice \u2013 what can I do? Punch my masseuse? No.\u201d",

            "content": "Due to climate change and rising global temperatures, the glaciers had been gradually thinning. When the glacier finally gave way, it sent a colossal amount of debris tumbling into the fjord, displacing enough material to fill around 10,000 Olympic-sized pools. You may have heard that the earth vibrated for nine days in 2023 and the event puzzled scientists across the globe. If you want to know about it, then you are at the right place. In September 2023, a melting glacier in eastern Greenland triggered a massive landslide, leading to a 650-foot-high mega-tsunami. This occurred in Dickson Fjord, a remote part of Greenland, and was caused by the destabilization of a glacier at the base of a 4,000-foot mountain. Due to climate change and rising global temperatures, the glaciers had been gradually thinning. When the glacier finally gave way, it sent a colossal amount of debris tumbling into the fjord, displacing enough material to fill around 10,000 Olympic-sized pools. Mysterious Global Vibrations Detected Following this event, scientists noticed an unusual global phenomenon: a persistent ground vibration lasting nine days. Unlike earthquake tremors, which are usually brief and intense, this signal was a continuous, low-frequency hum. Seismologists from across the globe were puzzled by the unfamiliar pattern, initially believing it to be a glitch in their equipment. Collaborative Global Investigation The unexpected signal sparked a year-long investigation by a group of 68 scientists from 15 different countries. By analyzing seismic readings, satellite data, and computer simulations, they identified the cause. The vibrations were the result of a \"seiche,\" a rhythmic wave motion that occurs when water sloshes back and forth within an enclosed space. The mega-tsunami's waves became trapped in the narrow fjord, causing the water to oscillate for over a week. This movement generated seismic energy that travelled across the globe. Warning of Climate Change Impact The findings highlight the ongoing and unpredictable impacts of climate change in the Arctic. The melting glacier that triggered the landslide is a reminder that the region is entering \"uncharted waters\" as global temperatures continue to rise, with severe consequences for ecosystems and human populations alike.",

            "content": "Sources indicate that the NDA government, despite not holding an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha this term, is confident that ONOE will be realized during this tenure. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government is preparing to implement the 'One Nation, One Election' (ONOE) policy within its current tenure, according to sources cited by the Press Trust of India (PTI). This significant electoral reform has been a long-standing agenda of the BJP, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reiterated his commitment to it throughout his political campaign. Government's Confidence in Passing ONOE Sources indicate that the NDA government, despite not holding an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha this term, is confident that ONOE will be realized during this tenure. The BJP secured 240 seats in the most recent elections, falling short of the 272 needed for a single-party majority. However, with the support of its allies, the government is optimistic that it will garner cross-party backing for the simultaneous polls reform. The ONOE policy aims to streamline the election process by holding both national and state elections at the same time. Advocates argue that it will reduce the frequent electoral cycles that currently dominate Indian politics and hinder governance. Prime Minister Modi's Advocacy for ONOE In his 11th consecutive Independence Day speech on August 15, Prime Minister Modi called for political parties to come together in support of the ONOE initiative. He emphasized that repeated elections at different levels of government are a \"hurdle to India's progress.\" This vision of simultaneous elections was also a key promise in the BJP's election manifesto. Throughout his campaign for a third term, Modi promised that major reforms would be undertaken, and ONOE is seen as one of the central goals of this government. The momentum for ONOE gained further traction when a panel led by former President Ram Nath Kovind submitted its report earlier this year. The committee's findings, delivered to President Draupadi Murmu, strongly endorsed the idea of conducting simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections. The report has been pivotal in shaping the discourse around ONOE, lending further credibility to the reform. Overcoming Political and Legislative Challenges Despite the NDA\u2019s determination, implementing ONOE will require overcoming both political and logistical challenges. As ONOE would necessitate constitutional amendments and modifications to electoral laws, the government will need to ensure support from opposition parties and regional players. However, sources suggest that the government believes there is sufficient political will to push the reform forward during this term. The BJP-led NDA government has positioned ONOE as a reform that will bring stability and efficiency to India\u2019s electoral system, marking it as a cornerstone of their current administration. With Modi\u2019s strong endorsement and the backing of key institutional reports, the path toward implementing 'One Nation, One Election' seems to be unfolding within the coming years.",

Several influential leaders of Jamaat are contesting assembly polls as independent candidates. In a significant political development, the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) headed by Lok Sabha member Sheikh Abdul Rashid alias Engineer and former members of Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI) have come together in a strategic alliance for the Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls. \"A joint meeting was held today in which the AIP delegation was led by AIP Supremo and chief spokesperson Inam Un Nabi, while the JEI delegation was led by Ghulam Qadir Wani. Prominent JEI members participated in the discussions,\" the AIP said in a statement. Jamaat-e-Islami Jammu and Kashmir was banned by the Union Home Ministry in 2019. The ban was extended for another five years in February this year. Several influential leaders of Jamaat are contesting assembly polls as independent candidates. An AIP spokesperson said the two sides agreed to work together in the larger interest of the region's population. The goal is to secure a resounding victory for AIP and JEI candidates, ensuring that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have strong representatives who can articulate their sentiments and aspirations, he said. \"Following comprehensive deliberations, it was agreed that AIP would support JEI-backed candidates in Kulgam and Pulwama Similarly, JEI will throw its support behind AIP candidates across Kashmir,\" he said. In areas where both AIP and JEI have fielded candidates, the alliance has agreed to a \"friendly contest,\" particularly in constituencies like Langate, Devsar and Zainapora, he said. In other constituencies, mutual support will be extended to ensure a unified approach to the elections, the spokesman added. \"Both parties underscored the importance of unity in resolving the Kashmir issue and promoting a lasting and dignified peace in the region. \"They highlighted the rapidly evolving political landscape, both regionally and internationally, and stressed that neither JEI nor AIP can afford to remain passive observers,\" the spokesman said. The leadership of both AIP and JEI have called upon their cadres to spread the message of support for each other's candidates, in line with the agreement. \"The goal is to secure a resounding victory for AIP and JEI candidates, ensuring that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have strong representatives who can articulate their sentiments and aspirations,\" he added.",

            "content": "Maintaining a clean slate, favourites India will fancy their chances when they take on a below-par but unpredictable Korea in the semifinals of the Asian Champions Trophy hockey tournament in Hulunbuir on Monday (September 16, 2024). Paris Olympics bronze medallist India have been in rollicking form in the tournament so far, registering five wins out of five league matches. The Harmanpreet Singh-led side started their campaign with a 3-0 win over hosts China and then trounced Japan and Malaysia 5-1 and 8-1 respectively. India then beat Korea 3-1 before eking out a narrow 2-1 win over arch-rivals Pakistan. It has been a commanding performance from the Indians as they excelled in every department \u2014 be it forwardline, midfield or defence. The most promising part of India's performance in the league stages has been the form of the strikers. Scoring field goals was a major concern in Paris but here the young forwardline comprising Sukhjeet Singh, Abhishek, Uttam Singh, Gurjot Singh, Araijeet Singh Hundal and others have exceeded expectations. Young midfielder Raj Kumar Pal, too, has shone bright, scoring some fine field goals. Besides, veteran Manpreet Singh, vice-captain Vivek Sagar Prasad and Nilakanta Sharma have excelled in the midfield. The Indian defence too has performed stoutly, conceding just four goals with goalkeepers Krishan Bahadur Pathak and Suraj Karkera not letting the team feel the void left by the retirement of the talismanic PR Sreejesh. Harmanpreet, one of the best drag-flickers in the world currently, has led from the front and has continued his good form of Paris, converting as many as five penalty corners. When India struggled for field goals, Harmanpreet stood up with his penalty corner conversions. Harmanpreet also has an able understudy in young Jugraj Singh, who is right now the fastest dragflicker in the world. But a knockout game is a new beginning for any side and the Indians can ill afford to take Korea lightly as they can spring a surprise on their day, evidence of which was their last-gasp equaliser to draw 3-3 against Malaysia and keep their semifinal hopes alive. The Indian defence will also have to be cautious about not conceding too many penalty corners as in Jihun Yang, the tournament's leading scorer with seven goals, Korea possesses a potent drag-flicker. In the other semifinal of the day, Pakistan will take on hosts China. The final is scheduled for Tuesday. Harmanpreet warned his teammates against taking Korea lightly despite his side's impressive run so far in this tournament. \"We came into this tournament with very little rest or preparations after our Olympic campaign. Despite that, I am happy with how the team has done to progress into the semifinal stage. \"Korea is a tough team, they defend very well and can counter attack fast and skillfully,\" said Harmanpreet. Talking about the previous encounter against Pakistan, the ace drag-flicker said it was good the youngsters have shaken off the nerves of playing against Pakistan. \"I think there was a bit of nerves in the match against Pakistan. After their goal, there was a bit of panic especially with some of the youngsters in the squad playing against them for the first time. \"While the focus tomorrow will be on ourselves, it will be interesting to watch how Pakistan to do against China,\" he said.

            "content": "A district consumer commission directed e-commerce platform Flipkart, and a vendor to refund \u20b928,703 for delivering a wrong product, and pay compensation. The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Ranga Reddy, was dealing with a case filed by Morla Navya. The opposite parties were Flipkart India Private Limited and Sane Retails Private Limited. The complainant stated that she had ordered a Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G mobile phone from Flipkart for \u20b928,703. However, to her surprise, she received a CP Plus Wi-Fi Home Camera worth about \u20b93,000. She immediately contacted Flipkart\u2019s customer support for a replacement or refund, but to no avail. Despite contacting the vendor, the issue remained unresolved. Taking the the arguments and evidence placed on record, the commission noted that both the parties were absent. In an ex parte order, noting that service was deficient, the OP was directed to pay \u20b928,703 to the complainant, with 9% interest. Additionally, \u20b95,000 was awarded as compensation. Costs of \u20b95,000 were also imposed. The commission further directed the complainant to return the CP Plus Wi-Fi Home Camera after receiving the refund. The OP were given 45 days to comply with the order, after which the interest rate would increase to 12%.

Moreover, the actor also almost confirmed that Tumbbad's 3rd part with be a prequel to the first film. Whereas the second part will deal with Vinayak Rao's son Pandu Rang's storyline.

The actor-producer revealed that Tumbbad took almost two decades to make its way to the cinemas. The film written by Rahi Anil Barve went to several media houses but producers didn't see the potential in the story.

            "description": "At a government hospital in Kolkata, mass post-surgical eye infection among 20 people rendered them partially or completely blind. Moyurie Som finds that the survivors are mostly elderly tailors and workers in low-income families whose lives were pushed into darkness, and no compensation was offered by the State",
            "content": "Like most mothers, Rezwana Parveen, 60, was excited for her daughter\u2019s wedding later this year. In preparation, she decided to get cataract surgery in her right eye at Kolkata\u2019s Garden Reach State General Hospital (GRSGH) in July. Parveen made the journey from Asansol, about 200 kilometres from Kolkata at GRSGH, on Friday, June 28. \u201cThe next day I could not see anything. So, I went back to the hospital, and the doctors gave me eye drops and sent me home,\u201d she says, perched on Bed 185 in the dilapidated female ward of the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology (RIO) about a week after her cataract surgery. \u201cThe day after, the doctors at GRSGH called us in a panic and asked us to come to Kolkata\u2019s Medical College immediately,\u201d she recalled, as her daughters prepped her for discharge. \u201cThey said my eye had been infected.\u201d As per hospital estimates, Parveen is one of at least 20 who had undergone cataract surgery at the West Bengal government-run GRSGH between June 26 and June 29 this year, who were left partially or completely blind in the operated eye, after alleged post-surgical infections. Between these days, 40 people had surgeries, a GRSGH doctor says. The Medical Superintendent of GRSGH, Koushik Ray, confirmed that the hospital authorities had contacted all the patients after they detected an infection in one of them during their first post-surgical follow-up. \u201cEventually, infections were detected in 20 patients, and for further treatment, they were sent to RIO, the eye department in Medical College, Kolkata,\u201d he says. On the day of her discharge, Parveen was bereft. \u201cThey are sending me home, but I still cannot see anything. The doctors here told me that I might never be able to see with this eye,\u201d she said. By then she had undergone three more procedures in her affected eye at RIO. \u201cI opted for this surgery to better my life, but it made everything worse. I wish I had never done it,\u201d she says, a tear trickling down from behind her dark glasses. A patient on the bed opposite says, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, your eye will get worse.\u201d GRSGH was founded in 1997, first with OPD, and then with in-patient facilities starting in 2000. \u201cIt took a prolonged citizen movement and repeated negotiations with then Chief Minister Jyoti Basu for the hospital to be built here,\u201d says Kushal Debnath, 65, who founded the social welfare organisation Garden Reach Nagarik Parishad in 1984. He was at the centre of the movement that demanded a State-run hospital in here to cater to over 30 lakh people residing in the three Assembly constituencies in the area: Kolkata Port, Maheshtala, and Metiabruz. The area is densely populated with narrow roads, overflowing drains, and a crumbling infrastructure. Livelihoods lost Over a month later, Parveen has settled down in her daughter in-law\u2019s two-room house in Kolkata\u2019s Metiabruz. There is no one to look after her in Asansol. \u201cI see no light,\u201d she says. \u201cI cannot do anything by myself anymore. I need help eating and moving around. When I close my eyes, I cannot sleep.\u201d Rezwana Parveen, at her daughter-in-law\u2019s house in Kolkata.| Photo Credit:DEBASISH BHADURI Her younger daughter, Sahana Afreen, 26, who is set to get married in December this year, is upset. \u201cHow can I be excited for my wedding when my mother is in such pain?\u201d she says. Her wedding fund has been rapidly depleting due to her mother\u2019s continuing eye ailment. \u201cMy brother was training to be a welder. He took a break to look after my mother, and now he lost his job,\u201d Afreen says. \u201cWe were poor, but this crisis has made us poorer in a hundred different ways.\u201d Metiabruz, where most of the survivors hail from, is a densely populated neighbourhood in the southwestern fringes of Kolkata, near the Hooghly river. Home to the exiled last nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah, in the mid- 1800s, the area is a \u2018miniature Lucknow\u2019. Now it is predominantly inhabited by tailors, labourers, and traders with small businesses. The West Bengal government website says Metiabruz is India\u2019s largest garment cluster, with nearly 5 lakh workers here and in the surrounding areas engaged in garment manufacturing. For many victims, post-surgical vision loss means a complete loss of livelihood. \u201cWe have received no compensation for what we lost. I used to work as a tailor. Now I cannot do anything,\u201d says Rafik Mondal, 60. Now, he can only see a beam of light in his left eye. In the living room of their house in the far interiors of Metiabruz, Mondal\u2019s tailoring machine and incomplete garment orders lay abandoned. \u201cBoth of us used to earn around \u20b93,000 each as tailors every week. Now our family income has halved because my father cannot work,\u201d his older son says. He adds that his father\u2019s treatment at RIO cost \u20b98,000 including medicines, food, and travel. \u201cWe bought all the medicines ourselves, including one injection that cost \u20b93,500. The administration provided nothing,\u201d he says. Left in the lurch Salim Sheikh, in his 50s, would size and cut threads for a living. The cumulative cost of treatment at RIO got so heavy that he discharged himself prematurely. He could not afford the medicines anymore. \u201cMy work fetched me \u20b91,500 a week. With medicines, food, and my family\u2019s travel expenses to and from Medical College, Kolkata, I spent \u20b96,000 in just a few days,\u201d Sheikh says. His daughter Suraiya Bibi is upset at many things: her father\u2019s condition, the expense despite it being a government hospital, and a future without a livelihood. Salim Sheikh and his daughter Suraiya Bibi at the male eye ward in the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology at Medical College, Kolkata.| Photo Credit:DEBASISH BHADURI Two weeks later, Sheikh was left languishing without work in the confines of a double-roomed thatched house in the semi-rural interiors of Metiabruz. \u201cThe medication that I am on now is mostly to suppress the pain in my eye. But I only see darkness, and I don\u2019t see much hope of my vision coming back,\u201d he says. Mohammed Iqbal, also in his 50s, who lost 90% vision in his operated eye, earned \u20b915,000 a month from selling mobile phones at Khidirpur\u2019s Fancy Market. \u201cI have been bedridden and unemployed for the last three months. I have two unmarried daughters, a 10-year-old son, and an old ailing mother to provide for,\u201d he says. His bedridden mother\u2019s medication costs \u20b9850 a month. \u201cNow my own medicines cost me over \u20b95,000 a month,\u201d he says. Iqbal\u2019s household had been running on a \u20b950,000 loan from his employer when the tragedy unfolded. He now spends his days sequestered in a dark bedroom in his house, wondering what his future, and that of his family\u2019s, holds. \u201cEveryone knows me as Biryani Rahman or Rahman Bawarchi,\u201d says Abdul Rahman, 61, his black goggles sitting above his unkempt moustache. Since he was 14, Rahman has been a cook in Garden Reach\u2019s Clocktower area. \u201cLocals and senior police officers in the city used to visit and place orders with me.\u201d Since his post-surgical eye infection, he has been unable to stand close to a fire. \u201cThe doctors have said exposure to fire will hurt the affected eye. That has taken a massive toll on his work and income,\u201d says his brother and primary caregiver Abdur Rahim. \u201cAfter news spread that he is suffering from an eye infection, people have also stopped placing orders with him.\u201d Fallout on ground Dr. Anu Singh, who heads the eye department at GRSGH, claims that after being discharged from RIO, all patients have vision in the range of 1 foot to 4 feet in the affected eye. \u201cFurther recovery will vary in individual patients depending on the presence of comorbidity [diabetes, for instance] and can take months,\u201d she says. In the weeks following the revelation of the infection cluster, the eye department at the GRSGH bore a deserted look. Operation theatres and eye wards were locked, with only cleaning staff going in from time to time. \u201cThe OPD (outpatient department) is running regularly as usual. The OT (operation theatre) will start after permission from higher authorities following all protocols post-infection,\u201d Dr. Singh says. Even after a month, the OPD, usually bustling with up to 300 patients, had a tense silence, populated with about 150 people. Meanwhile, the ripples of this mishap have travelled across Metiabruz and nearby areas. \u201cPeople coming to our weekly eye camp say they prefer the doctors here than at GRSGH,\u201d says Md. Zahid Uddin Haldar, a social worker at Akra Kabi Nazrul Smriti Welfare Society, a non-profit which conducts weekly medical camps for locals in Garden Reach\u2019s Akra. A 40-year-old tailor, who was undergoing eye treatment at GRSGH before the infection cluster was revealed, now consults the ophthalmologist at the Nazrul Smriti Society eye camp. \u201cInitially I was seeking treatment at GRSGH, but since the mishap, I am scared of going there again,\u201d he says, waiting for his turn at the camp. Rafik Mondal\u2019s sewing machine and incomplete tailoring orders lie abandoned after post-surgical infection.| Photo Credit:MOYURIE SOM After the allegations came to light, Principal Secretary of the State Health Department, Narayan Swaroop Nigam said that the GRSGH is reputed for its ophthalmology department. \u201cMedicines used in the surgeries were sent for examination, and a team is investigating the matter,\u201d he added. According to a senior ophthalmologist from West Bengal\u2019s Nadia district who tracked the case, three major factors might lead to such infection clusters: poor cleanliness or bad airflow in the operation theatre, human error, and most commonly, contaminated consumables used in surgery. He explains that consumables like viscoelastic substances \u2014 a must in cataract surgery \u2014 are most prone to contamination because the onus to ensure sterile packaging lies entirely with the manufacturer. \u201cEven now the set-up at GRSGH is very patchy. There aren\u2019t enough doctors round the clock, the nursing system is shoddy, and not every speciality is catered to here,\u201d Kushal says. He mentions the Metiabruz Super-Speciality Hospital, which was built as an annexe of the GRSGH a few years ago and houses the ophthalmology department where the surgeries took place. \u201cThe name says super-speciality hospital, but that\u2019s not the reality at all,\u201d he says. Shafqat Rahim, a local activist and niece of patient Abdur Rahman, has decided to file a public interest litigation in the Calcutta High Court to ensure justice for the affected patients. \u201cWe want punishment for the culprits. They should be suspended, their medical licences should be cancelled, and their salaries stopped,\u201d she says. Adequate compensation and a high-level Criminal Investigation Department inquiry are also on her list of demands. \u201cWe vote them into power and they trample on us like this,\u201d she says. \u201cNone of our leaders has cared even to visit the patients and see how they are.\u201d Published - September 15, 2024 06:37 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit medical colleges / health / health organisations / health and hygiene",

            "content": "UPI Transaction Limit: The new UPI limit will also apply to other transactions, including payments to hospitals, educational institutions, IPOs, and RBI retail direct schemes. UPI Transaction Limit: The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has increased the transaction limit for tax payments using UPI to help millions of taxpayers in the country. Now, individuals will be able to use the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to pay taxes up to Rs 5 lakh per transaction from tomorrow Sept 16. Alignment With RBI Policy This decision aligns with the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) monetary policy statement on August 8, 2024, which raised the UPI transaction limit for tax payments. This increase aims to make large transactions more convenient for taxpayers. The decision aims to simplify the tax payment process and encourage more people to use UPI for higher-value transactions. UPI Transactions With Rs 5 Lakh Upper Limit: Eligible Transaction Types Notably, the new UPI limit will also apply to other transactions, including payments to hospitals, educational institutions, IPOs, and RBI retail direct schemes. Hence, the banks and UPI apps must be checked for compatibility with the new limits. It is important to note that this increased limit is only applicable to certain transactions, and users should verify with their bank and UPI app to ensure they support this feature. NPCI Urges Banks, Payment Service Providers Meanwhile, the NPCI has asked all the members \u2014 banks, payment service providers and UPI apps to ensure compliance with the increase in tax payment transaction limit for the MCC 9311 category of verified merchants by September 15, 2024. Previous Changes To UPI Limits The NPCI revised UPI transaction limits in both December 2021 and December 2023, highlighting its continuous efforts to broaden UPI usage across different sectors, including tax payments. Introduction Of UPI Circle Feature The new feature, \"UPI Circle,\" enables primary UPI account holders to delegate transactions to trusted individuals, improving both security and convenience. UPI Transaction Limits For Various Payments: The standard UPI transaction limit for peer-to-peer payments is Rs 1 lakh. However, individual banks can set their own UPI limits. For example, Allahabad Bank has a UPI transaction limit of Rs 25,000, as per Google Pay's UPI bank-wise limits. In contrast, banks like HDFC and ICICI allow transactions up to Rs 1 lakh. Adding further, UPI apps may have their own transaction limits, which can vary across platforms. There are other transaction limits for different types of UPI transactions. UPI transactions related to capital markets, collections, insurance, and foreign inward remittances have a limit of Rs 2 Lakh per day.",

            "content": "Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer has acknowledged that the Maldives-India ties witnessed rough patches in the initial days of President Mohammad Muizzu-led government but insisted that the two countries have resolved the \u201cmisunderstandings\". Zameer made the remarks on Friday during a visit to Sri Lanka, where he stressed the importance of the Indian Ocean archipelago's relationships with key allies, particularly China and India. He said that relations with India had faced challenges, particularly following President Muizzu\u2019s campaign to remove a small contingent of Indian troops from the Maldives. Zameer said that the \"misunderstandings\" between the two countries have been resolved following the repatriation of Indian troops from the Maldives. \"At the start of our government, we did have some rough patches (with India), you know,\" Zameer has been quoted as saying by The Edition newspaper. \"(We) have good relations with both China and India, and both countries continue to support Maldives,\u201d he said. India's relationship with the Maldives came under strain since Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, took charge as the President. Within hours of his oath, he had demanded the withdrawal of Indian military personnel manning three aviation platforms gifted by India to the Maldives. After talks between the two sides, the Indian military personnel were replaced by civilians. Things escalated after three Maldivian deputy ministers made controversial remarks regarding India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media. Maldives Foreign Ministry distanced itself from their remarks, and the three junior ministers were suspended. Unlike his predecessors, who made the first port of call to New Delhi after assuming office, Muizzu travelled to Turkiye first and to China for his first state visit in January. He visited New Delhi on June 9 to attend Prime Minister Modi\u2019s swearing-in ceremony. Muizzu will travel to India on an official visit \"very soon\", his spokesperson said on Tuesday. Zameer also said that the Maldives has no plans to seek an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout, dismissing the current economic challenges faced by his country as \"temporary.\" \"We have bilateral partners who are very sensitive to our needs and our situation,\" he said, signalling the government's confidence in addressing its fiscal issues without resorting to external assistance from the IMF. \"I seriously don't think it is a time where we will be right now engaging with the IMF. The issue that we have is very temporary because currently, we are having a dip in reserves.\" Zameer outlined the government\u2019s strategy to address the economic situation, which includes implementing reforms in the tax regime and cost-cutting measures for government-owned enterprises. He also highlighted the strengthening of bilateral relations with China and India, noting that these countries have been instrumental in supporting the Maldives. His remarks came in the wake of warnings from credit rating agencies about the Maldives\u2019 financial situation. The Maldives owes much of its external debt to China and India. The government's debt servicing commitments amount to USD 409 million this year, placing additional stress on its already limited foreign currency reserves. Maldives reserves currently stand at USD 444 million, with usable reserves at USD 61 million, the paper said. \"The rationalisation of state-owned enterprises will certainly help us in managing our resources better,\" Zameer said. Zameer was joined by Finance Minister Mohamed Shafeeq in Sri Lanka, where the two held meetings with Sri Lankan central bankers and other officials to discuss financial matters.

            "content": "Delhi Police came up with a new strategy to combat rising crime rates and ensure the safety of passengers travelling in the Delhi Metro. The city police implemented a new security plan under which they will deploy officers in plain clothes at vulnerable metro stations during peak hours. Delhi Police recently conducted a 'temporal and spatial analysis' to review its security plan in which they found a surge in crime reports following increase in ridership in recent months. The 'temporal and spatial', are terms that refer to time and space. The data was collected from 190 metro stations to determine the time at which crime incidents remained high at stations, said official sources from police. The police identified 32 out of 190 metro stations susceptible to theft, harassment, and other offences. Among these 32 metro stations were Kashmiri Gate, Rajiv Chowk, Seelampur, Anand Vihar and Kalkaji. \"Our goal is to create a safer environment for commuters,\" Joint Commissioner of Police (transport range) Vijay Singh said. \"By blending in with the crowd, our officers can more effectively deter criminal activity and respond to incidents promptly,\" he said, adding \"you can call them like our undercover officers\". The security of the Delhi Metro is looked after by the CISF (Central Industrial Security Force) and Delhi Police. While the CISF does frisking and checking, the city police register FIRs, conduct probes and also do patrolling inside the metro premises. This is a separate unit of Delhi Police, with sixteen metro police stations located at the metro premises in different parts of the city. A DCP-level officer heads the unit. JCP Singh said the enhanced security measures will include increased visibility of female officers on platforms and trains to address concerns about women's safety. Additionally, the police will leverage technology to monitor suspicious behaviour and identify potential threats, the JCP added. By proactively addressing these issues in the metro, the police aim to maintain the Delhi Metro's reputation as a reliable and secure public transportation system, Singh said. According to the plan, a police officer will be deployed at the entrance while two-three, including female police staff, will keep their eye on platforms and trains during the peak hours. Singh further said that temporal and spatial data analysis helped the police identify the vulnerable locations and points at the metro stations. The deployment of such personnel may start from this week onwards, he added. According to police statistics, Delhi Metro has reported 3,952 cases of thefts this year so far. Till September 8, 2023, at least 3,709 cases of thefts were reported in the metro. The official sources said that these cases of thefts include pickpockets, missing mobile phones, purses or other valuable items of the passengers and metro staff. It also includes thefts of the metro properties. According to an official statement of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the metro has recorded 13 of its highest passenger journeys in the past month, with daily commuters ranging from over 72 lakh to 78 lakh.

Najmul Shanto-led Bangladeshi team arrived at Chennai International Airport and then received a grand welcome at the ITC hotel. The Bangladesh Cricket Board shared a video of the team's landing in Chennai and the warm welcome received by the hosts. After a historic away Test series against Pakistan earlier this month, Bangladesh take on the world No.1 Indian side in two Tests starting in Chennai on September 19. Captain Najmul Shanto revealed that his side has been boosted with confidence after the heroics in Pakistan and added that they are hoping for positive results in India as well. \"It's definitely going to be a very challenging series for us,\" Shanto was quoted as saying at Dhaka Airport on Sunday. \"After a good series against Pakistan, there is definitely an extra confidence in the team, in the people of the country. \"Every series is an opportunity. We will play to win both matches. The things that matter to win, the process matters. Our aim will be to do the work properly. Good results are possible if we do our job properly.\" Shanto accepted the challenge they will face against India pointing out the big difference in the two nations' Test rankings. He also added that his team will look to focus on playing good cricket and predicted a chance to beat India if they take the game to the last session. \"If you see the ranking, they are much ahead of us,\" Shanto added further. \"We have been playing well lately. We have had a good series. Our aim will be to play well for five days. The result comes in the last session on the last day. If we play good cricket for five days, there is a chance for either team to win in the last session.\"",

The Hyderabad City Police has established a control room to address any issues that may arise during the immersion day. In a video conference on Sunday, City Police Commissioner C.V. Anand outlined the challenges ahead and emphasized the need for increased vigilance and effective traffic management. He directed all zonal DCPs, SHOs and patrol teams to intensify their efforts to maintain law and order during the festivities. Addressing concerns from last year\u2019s events, the CP stressed the importance of a robust traffic plan, especially at key junctions like Basheerbagh and MJ Market. He urged organizers to move the idols promptly and assured them of all necessary support. The police have also implemented a comprehensive security plan, including increased patrolling, intelligence gathering, anti-sabotage checks and the deployment of additional forces. The use of drones, camera-mounted vehicles and SHE Teams will further enhance security measures. In addition to the Ganesh festivities, the police are also preparing for the Milad-Un-Nabi procession on September 19. Detailed discussions were held to ensure smooth conduct of both events.

            "content": "Tiruchi Corporation has initiated measures to establish a bio-compressed natural gas (bio-CNG) plant at the Ariyamangalam dump yard with a capacity to process about 100 tonnes per day of the organic waste generated in the city. Work on the facility is likely to commence in October. With the completion of phase II of biomining at the dump yard, the civic body has initiated preliminary measures to establish a biogas plant to process the vegetables, meat, and other organic waste to produce CNG. A sum of \u20b935 crore has been sanctioned under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) 2.0 for the facility. Around four acres of land in the retrieved space of the dump yard will be utilised for the plant. A tender was floated a few months back to find a suitable contractor to construct the plant under a public-private partnership (PPP) mode for producing biogas from the waste collected from houses and commercial establishments. \u201cThe tender would be awarded soon, and the project is expected to commence by next month. The project would be completed within 12 months from the commencement of work,\u201d said V. Saravanan, Corporation Commissioner. The plant will be built in design, build, finance, operate, and transfer (DBFOT) mode. After 20 years, the contractor will return the assets to the civic body. The produced bio-CNG will be utilised for commercial needs such as fuel in transport vehicles. Officials said that the biogas plant will prevent the land from turning into a dump yard and help improve the air quality of the city as the burning of waste will come down. A material recovery facility would be set up at the yard to segregate the dry waste into recyclable, non-recyclable, inert, and refuse-derived fuel, which will be sold to scrap dealers and factories for reuse. The civic body has outsourced the collection, segregation, transportation, and processing of waste generated in all 65 wards in the city to a private agency. On average, 400-450 tonnes of municipal solid waste is collected daily from the households in the city.

During his visit to Sisaiya Churaman village, he interacted with family members of the victims and conducted an aerial survey to assess the areas affected by the persistent wolf attack threat. Addressing a public gathering during his visit, CM Adityanath reviewed the situation in the region and informed the public about the state government's ongoing efforts to curb the crisis like situation. He said, \"Some children have died due to the terror of wolves over the last two months, and others have been injured. When I was first informed about this, I immediately instructed the administration to launch a campaign.\" \"In the span of two months, over eight human lives were lost in an area of 20 to 25 km. In the rescue operations conducted so far, five wolves have been captured, but one is still on the loose. The forest department team is here, and their priority is to rescue the wolf. If it poses a threat to human life, they have orders to shoot it, but that is a last resort,\" the CM added. Significantly, the Chief Minister during the public address, also addressed the potential causes of the increased animal-human conflict in the region, noting that seasonal changes and flooding likely displaced the wolves from their natural habitats. \"In sensitive areas, such conflicts often arise when water floods the habitats of wild animals, forcing them into human settlements in search of prey. This is where attacks are most likely to occur,\" he explained. He also recalled that in July, when the Saryu River overflowed, a wolf preyed on a one-year-old child. The attacks have not been concentrated in one village but have occurred in different villages with a 4-5 day gap between incidents. The most recent attack took place on September 1, and there have been no reports of wolf attacks since then. Further, the CM also praised the cooperation between the forest department and local representatives in handling the situation. He said the victims' families were assured of \u20b95 lakh in compensation, while those injured have been given rabies vaccines as a precautionary measure against the disease.",

Jammu And Kashmir News: Ajaz Ahmad Guru, brother of Parliament attack convict Mohammad Afzal Guru, has said that his brother was victim of a conspiracy. He also said that he will reveal the names of the people behind the conspiracy in his next press conference. While speaking at a press conference in Jammu and Kashmir's Sopore, Ajaz said, \u201cMy brother Afzal and we were all victims of a conspiracy. He said you are asking to name whose conspiracy it was I will do in the next press conference in Delhi but added his (Afzal\u2019s) and mine ideologies are different\". Earlier this week, Ajaz Guru filed his nomination to contest the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir. He's running as an independent candidate from the Sopore seat, which is located in the north Kashmir district. Ajaz, a resident of Baramulla's Delina area, submitted his nomination papers on the last day of filing. Elaborating on the reason behind his decision to contest assembly polls, he said, Youth wants to see peace and prosperity, and that has prompted him to join politics and fight elections. \u201cMy father has seen the fight for the pre-53 position; I have seen the Farooq Abdullah regime, and my son had gone through the Hurriyat regime. What the new generation needs is peace, prosperity, and development,\" Ajaz said. He also stated that he will restore the dignity of Sopore, which has been neglected for the last 50 years and labored as \"anti-India.\u201d. He further stated, \u201cI have seen a lot, and the youth today want peace. If voted to power, I will change Sopore, bringing development and unity,\u201d he added. After filing his papers, Ajaz Guru told reporters that he entered the electoral fray as, like all Kashmiris, he was also a victim of \"35 years of hardships.\" The last date to withdraw the papers is September 17. Sopore will go to the polls in the third phase of the elections on October 1. Afzal Guru was hanged in Delhi's Tihar jail on February 9, 2013, for plotting the December 2001 attack on Parliament.",

Mumbai: Actress Kangana Ranaut, who is awaiting the release of her upcoming movie \u2018Emergency\u2019, recently looked back at her younger self as she shared a video from the music launch of her film 'Woh Lamhe'. The actress spoke her dissatisfaction with her appearance during the promotional event, and encouraged women to embrace their true self. She recently took to her X, formerly Twitter, and penned a message for all women who are struggling with low self-esteem. She wrote, \u201cThis is a video from my second film 'Woh Lamhe' music launch. I was just a teenager and, like many young women, I disliked everything about my appearance. It\u2019s common for young women to feel unsure of their looks, which can make them more vulnerable and uncertain. Looking back now, I realise I didn\u2019t appreciate not just my appearance, but the vitality and energy I had during that time\". She further mentioned, \"Today is the youngest you will ever be. Every stage of life has its own beauty. Even if you can\u2019t see it in the mirror, trust that one day you will look back and recognize it. Be kind to yourself and trust that you are beautiful\". This is a video from my second film Woh Lamhe music launch, I was just a teenager and like every young woman I hated everything about my appearance, no young woman thinks she is attractive or beautiful, probably that also makes them more vulnerable, innocent and approachable,... pic.twitter.com/5XOq7jwM6Q Kangana made her debut with 'Gangster' in which she shared the screen with Emraan Hashmi and Shiney Ahuja. Meanwhile, on the work front, the actress is gearing up for her upcoming second directorial 'Emergency' in which she essays the role of the former Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. The film is set in the 1970s during the period of emergency when civil rights in India were curbed. The film is written and directed by Kangana Ranaut, and also stars Anupam Kher, Mahima Chaudhary, Milind Soman, Shreyas Talpade, Vishak Nair, and the late Satish Kaushik in pivotal roles. It is produced by Zee Studios and Manikarnika Films. The movie was initially scheduled for release on September 6, 2024 but was delayed due to certification issues. The film has now received a U/A certification, and a new release date is expected to be announced soon.",

            "content": "A new study reveals that hormone therapy can greatly reduce insulin resistance in postmenopausal women, offering potential health benefits. A new meta-analysis of 17 different randomised, controlled trials suggests that hormone therapy can significantly reduce insulin resistance. Menopausal women are at greater risk of insulin resistance as a result of declining estrogen levels. Previous studies evaluating the potential benefits of hormone therapy on insulin resistance have produced mixed results. In the new study, Dr Xuezhi (Daniel) Jiang, lead researcher from Reading Hospital Tower Health and Drexel University College of Medicine in Pennsylvania in the US, said their analysis showed that both types of hormone therapy, including oral and transdermal routes, significantly reduced insulin resistance in healthy postmenopausal women, although estrogen alone was associated with a more prominent reduction when compared to a combination hormone therapy. A number of studies have previously attempted to determine the potential positive effect of hormone therapy on insulin resistance. However, those studies produced inconsistent results. But in this new meta-analysis, it was found that hormone therapy significantly reduced insulin resistance in healthy postmenopausal women without metabolic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. \u201cHormone therapy is an effective treatment for many bothersome menopause symptoms, including hot flashes,\u201d said Dr Stephanie Faubion, medical director for The Menopause Society. This new meta-analysis is important as declining estrogen levels in menopausal women put them at greater risk for insulin resistance and hormone therapy could be beneficial in reducing insulin resistance in these women, Faubion noted. Insulin resistance can occur in men or women, but menopausal women are at greater risk because, as estrogen levels fall during the menopause transition, the body can become less responsive to insulin. A diagnosis of insulin resistance is considered serious because it can be a precursor of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic disorders.",

            "content": "The Bhagyanagar Ganesh Utsav Samiti (BGUS) removed the banners and cut the fencing on the entry point of Tank Bund to immerse Ganesh idols despite the ban . The BGUS members led by its Secretary R. Shashidhar removed the banners with orders preventing immersion in the Tank Bund on the road connecting Dr. Ambedkar statue and Sailing Club and also cut the iron fencing. Later, they immersed more than 50 Ganesh idols. Mr. Shashidhar warned the government that religious beliefs cannot be hurt by the government and it was the responsibility of the government to move the High Court and get a stay on the ban. \u201cAfter announcing that all arrangements would be made for the immersion how can the Government now cite High Court directions\u201d, he asked. He questioned the sincerity of the government asking the silence for the last one year over the issue and acting at the last minute creating confusion. \u201cWe will violate the orders if the need be as a violation of orders is also a form of protest to safeguard the religious and spiritual beliefs of the Hindus,\u201d he said. Mr. Shashidhar urged the government to make arrangements for the immersion on September 17 as immersion at Tank Bund has been a tradition and can\u2019t be restricted. He also claimed that the High Court never restricted the immersion. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and the city police have put up posters at the entry of Tank Bund road and all connecting roads preventing Ganesh idols immersion citing the High Court orders. A 10-foot high fencing is also raised along the Tank Bund preventing immersion of idols.

A fresh encounter broke out between terrorists and police in the forested region of Kathua district in Jammu and Kashmir on Sundauy, while a separate overnight encounter in Poonch district concluded with a suspected injury to one terrorist, according to officials.

Additional forces were dispatched to seal off potential escape paths and assist in the neutralization of the terrorists, the officials informed. Meanwhile, in Poonch, the encounter that began overnight in the Pathanateer region near the Gursai peak in the Mendhar sub-division concluded around midday. Evidence of blood near the encounter site indicated that one terrorist may have been wounded, officials noted, stating that the area remains cordoned off and a search operation is in progress to locate the escaping militants. Following intelligence about the likely presence of two to three terrorists, a combined operation by the police and the Army was initiated on Saturday evening in the area.

            "content": "A 107-year-old narrow gauge steam locomotive is all set to chug in the lush green Matheran Hill Railway in Maharashtra again with the heritage loco having been overhauled at the Golden Rock Railway Workshop in Tiruchi. The \u2018B 794\u2019 steam locomotive weighing a little over 15 tonnes will be operated on the 20- km section from Neral to Matheran located on the Western Ghats range in Raigad district. The over 90-year-old Golden Rock Railway Workshop was entrusted with the task of overhauling the narrow gauge locomotive as it had the experience in carrying out periodic overhaul of \u2018X\u2019 class steam locomotives. Further, it is a nodal workshop for metre gauge and narrow gauge steam locomotives as declared by the Railway Board, New Delhi. A technical team of the workshop had carried out the overhauling of the locomotive which has been provided with a brand new redesigned HSD (high speed diesel) oil firing system instead of coal, said workshop authorities. As part of the overhauling, the loco has been renewed with a new main frame and accessories and fitted with new steam cylinders, besides being provided with an enhanced capacity water tank. The 100-year-old boiler has been overhauled and made into working condition. For ensuring smooth engine operation, tuning of valves and its setting has been carried out with utmost care. The loco has been provided with a twin pipe air brake emergency valve system with cut off cock provision as it hauls the air brakes coaches on the Neral - Matheran section. The new HSD oil firing system has been provided in a compact manner in the locomotive and user friendly to the crew. The locomotive will glow with LED lamps in the driver cabin and underframe. Headlights have been provided with halogen reflector arrangements. The loco has been given a fresh coat of PU (polyurethane) painting to boost the aesthetics. The authorities said the overhauled loco was ready for dispatch by road to the Central Railway. The Matheran Hill Railway covers a distance of 20 km between Neral and Matheran in the Western Ghats. The narrow gauge line is administered by the Central Railway. The construction of the line began in 1904 and completed in 1907. Matheran is connected to the town of Neral which lies at the base of the hills by narrow gauge rail line.

            "content": "Telugu star NTR Jr. opened up about the intense 35-day underwater shoot for 'Devara: Part 1', calling it one of the toughest scenes of his career. Telugu star NTR Jr., who is gearing up for the release of his upcoming movie 'Devara :Part 1', has shared insights about the film, and a scene which involved 35 days of shoot. He engaged in a conversation with filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga, and spoke about the challenges faced during the underwater shoot. He described the 35-day shoot as one of the toughest of his career, specifically mentioning the intricate details of a scene involving a shark. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s this mad interaction between the protagonist and the shark\u201d. He shared that shooting underwater required extreme precision, as the actors couldn\u2019t stay submerged for long. \u201cIf it's a six-second shot, they need to rehearse it properly and do an exact six-second shot\u201d. The depth of the pool added another layer of complexity, with some sequences taking place at 18 feet. \"It\u2019s not just swimming inside, it\u2019s fighting and killing inside\u201d, he added. Interestingly, water and fire were the themes of his blockbuster movie \u2018RRR\u2019 with the theme of water symbolising his character of freedom fighter Komaram Bheem. He said, \"That was my first underwater sequence ever,\" he recalled, noting that this latest challenge in \u2018Devara\u2019 pushed him further. One of the toughest parts was working without goggles, which made it difficult to see clearly. \"I didn\u2019t know where the camera is, I just knew it\u2019s somewhere there, but I couldn\u2019t actually see it\u201d. Despite all the challenges, NTR is proud of what the team achieved, calling it a complex but rewarding experience. Produced by Yuvasudha Arts and NTR Arts, the film also stars Saif Ali Khan and Janhvi Kapoor. Directed by Koratala Siva, \u2018Devara: Part 1\u2019 is scheduled to hit theatres on September 27, 2024.",

India\u2019s star wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson did something that left everyone in splits on Sunday in the ongoing Duleep Trophy 2024. Representing India D against India A, Samson turned on his attacking mode and ended up smashing 40 off 45, keeping his team in the massive run chase of 488. On the fourth day of play, India D required 426 runs more to win with Ricky Bhui and Yash Dubey batting unbeaten at the crease at 62/1. Bhui and Dubey's stand helped India D in the game but Shams Mulani helped India A to bounce back. The moment Dubey departed for 37, India D also lost Devdutt Padikkal. But then, Shreyas Iyer built a solid stand with Bhui, before getting out for 41 by Mulani. Samson then came out to bat at no 6 and played attacking cricket.

            "content": "Ramkumar Ramanathan and N Sriram Balaji could play well only in patches to lose the do-or-die doubles against Andre Goransson and Filip Bergevi as India succumbed to Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group I tie after conceding an unassailable 0-3 lead, in Stockholm on Sunday (September 15, 2024). After losing both the singles on Saturday (September 14, 2024) , India needed to win the third rubber to stay alive in the tie but Ramkumar and Balaji went down 3-6 4-6 in one hour and 19 minutes. India's dismal record against Sweden in the Davis Cup continued as it was the team's sixth defeat in as many ties. The reverse singles have been rendered inconsequential. India will now compete next year in Play-offs to keep place in World Group I. The Indian pair had its first chance in game three in the opening set on Goransson's serve. Balaji and Ramkumar pocketed four straight points to earn a breakpoint but the home team averted the danger. Ramkumar was, however, broken in the next game and Bergevi held his own to zoom to a commanding 5-2 lead. Balaji served to stay in the set and managed to hold. The home team comfortably sealed the opening set with Bergevi holding at love. In the second set, Ramkumar had a fiery start, holding at love. Bergevi though surprisingly struggled with his first serve as he committed two double faults to be at 30-all. Sensing a chance, Ramkumar attacked Bergevi's second serve but could respond only with a feeble shot on the Swede's widish cross court return. Standing at the net, it was an easy put away for Goransson. Balaji was under pressure in the next game. Serving at deuce, he fired an ace but Goransson hit a backhand volley winner on the next point to again make it deuce. The Indians soaked the pressure and eventually saved the game. Balaji faced the heat again in the seventh game with both Swedish players finding service return winners with attacking shots. Goransson earned a break chance with a volley winner from the net. Ramkumar hit a powerful forehand return following an exciting rally on that break point and later the Indians saved one more but on the third breakpoint Balaji netted a return. The lead stayed with the home team that served out the match in the 10th game. Ramkumar's causal forehand return landed outside the lines on the match point.

It has come down to the final match of the series to decide the winner as England and Australia are ready for the final dance in Manchester, Old Trafford. In the previous T20I, England were dominant after winning the toss and chasing down the target whereas Australia outclassed the hosts in the first game of the series in all departments. Liam Livingstone showcased brilliance with the bat in the second T20I smashing 87 runs to chase England's target in the 19th over. Matthew Short took a 5-wicket haul but his efforts went in vain as England levelled the series.

            "content": "Delay in appointing deans in some of the important government medical colleges in the Southern part of the State has been hampering important administrative processes and also the smooth functioning of the hospitals. As post of deans remains vacant in government medical colleges in Madurai, Ramanathapuram, Kanniyakumari, Theni and Virudhunagar, for the time being senior doctors are holding the post with Full Additional Charge (FAC). Though temporary arrangements have been made for administering the respective medical colleges and hospitals, the efficiency of a full-time dean cannot be matched by the in-charge deans, opine activists and former deans. For the Southern districts, Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) remains the key referral point. Though all the districts have their own government hospitals, the GRH, due to its capability of handling large numbers of patients with serious complications, plays a key role in treating numerous patients every single day. But the irony is that GRH has been in operating with no full-time dean since May 2024. After the retirement of A. Rathinavel, C. Dharmaraj, Professor, General Medicine, Madurai Medical College, assumed office as in -charge dean. Following his retirement, V. Selvarani, Professor, Department of Cardiology, Madurai Medical College, took over as in-charge dean. The number of dean in-charges in the recent days raises a critical question of how badly this would affect the functioning of the hospital and what is the key role of a dean in a government hospital. A retired government medical college dean, who does not want to be named says, though the powers of a dean were conferred on an in-charge dean, there would surely be a lag in decision-making. \u201cIn-charge deans enjoy both legal and financial powers but their commitment to the post varies. In their short period of stay, they will not wish to bear unnecessary burden,\u201d he adds. A view of Kanniyakumari Government Medical College hospital at Asaripallam in Nagercoil.| Photo Credit:SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT \u201cThough it seems that a dean with full additional charges can operate a hospital like a regular Dean, issues like enforcing discipline or getting respect from their subordinates or colleagues may pull down their performance,\u201d the senior doctor adds. Another Dean of a government medical college hospital in the State listing out the key functions of a Dean said, administrating treatment, education and research at their medical colleges and hospitals were the three broad functions. \u201cThe functions are innumerable. But, to point out a few - health delivery system, outpatient department function, inpatient care, central lab services, pharmacy, basic amenities provision, special services, schemes operation, supervision, review and monitoring of services, calamity management, reporting and surveillance of infectious diseases, reporting of births and deaths, budget, finance management, working staff grievances, medicolegal responsibility, fire safety measures, bio-medical and solid waste management, etc., are some of the major responsibilities,\u201d the doctor notes. A view of Theni Government Medical College Hospital.| Photo Credit:KARTHIKEYAN G Though these might sound like routine functions, each one carries an equal importance considering the seriousness of diseases and complexities with which patients were treated at the hospitals, he adds. \u201cIn simple things like managing inadequate medical staff at the hospital, a dean can order for using extra staff from a particular department to fill the existing vacancy, but in case of an in-charge Dean, though it is performable, due to lack of moral authority, this may not be possible leading to a huge struggle in pursuing the said duty,\u201d the dean says. In Madurai GRH, the medical store has been identified to be in a bad shape even by the Drugs Control Department, but no steps could be taken to change or modify the infrastructure allegedly due to lack of authority. A view of Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai..| Photo Credit:MOORTHY G A GRH official, requesting anonymity, says, though officials of the Drugs Control Department lack authority to take action against a government hospital for not maintaining the medicinal standards, they can recommend the changes that needs to be carried out. Based on that, the official says, that the Drug Control Department found irregularities in maintenance of drugs at the hospital during a recent inspection and had also reported to the in-charge dean. \u201cAs the in-charge dean was not in a position to immediately allot funds for renovation or procure instruments to maintain standards, he refused to carry forward the recommendations of the Drug Control Department,\u201d the official says. C. Anand Raj, health activist based in Madurai, referring to such delays in carrying out necessary works, says, \u201cIn-charge deans cannot match the expertise and experience of Deans who have been shortlisted for the post. Though the in-charge\u2019s duty is mostly given to doctors in the rank of head of departments, it cannot be said they would have the necessary power to take actions swiftly and boldly.\u201d Mr. Anand Raj, adds, doctors and the public have never witnessed such indefinite delays in several years. \u201cWhen the panel list for the dean posting is prepared several days ahead of the retirement of a dean, why cannot the health department act on the list which is already placed for their perusal,\u201d he questioned. \u201cOfficials were comparing the efficiency of performance observed in medical college hospitals in districts like Virudhunagar, Theni which were administered by in-charge deans. They say the same efficiency can be expected in super specialty hospitals run by deans in-charge. But, in reality, the super specialty hospitals are of a completely different league demanding high-level of experience from doctors to be appointed as deans,\u201d he notes. G. R. Ravindranath, General Secretary, Doctor\u2019s Association for Social Equality, says \u201cthe delay in appointment not only slows the functioning of the hospital, but also puts a huge burden on the person in-charge, who may be incapable or inexperienced. This also flouts the National Medical Commission\u2019s norms to appoint full-time dean in every medical college hospital\u201d he adds. The retired government hospital dean said the delay in posting a full-time dean would also affect the prospect of the eligible doctors who were on the list for the position. He adds, starting from top positions like Directors and Deans to professors, doctors under Directorate of Medical Education (DME) and Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMS) and Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, preparation of panels for promotion was also being delayed. Due to this, many senior doctors and professors retire without attaining their promotion, the dean adds. A senior health official says the panel for appointment of dean was ready and as Chief Minister M.K. Stalin was back in the State, the appointment process would start soon.

            "content": "Saleema Imtiaz has become the first Pakistani woman to be appointed to the ICC International Panel of development umpires, the Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed. The move marks a historic landmark in the women's sport in Pakistan. Imtiaz will now be able to officiate in the women's bilateral international matches and ICC women's events. Saleema is the mother of Pakistan women's cricketer Kainat Imtiaz, who has played 40 International matches for the Women in Green. She has experience of officiating in major events under the Asian Cricket Council such as the 2022 and 2024 ACC Women\u2019s T20 Asia Cup and the 2023 ACC Emerging Women\u2019s Cup in Hong Kong. \"Her first on-field appointment in a bilateral series will see her officiate the Pakistan-South Africa women\u2019s T20I series in Multan, which begins on Monday. She will be partnered by Faisal Aafreedi from the PCB International Panel of Umpires with Nasir Hussain as TV umpire, while Humairah Farah will serve as the fourth umpire and Muhammad Javed Malik from the PCB International Panel of Match Referees will oversee the series as match referee,\" the PCB said in a statement. The 52-year-old Saleema expressed her gratitude for this development. \"I am beyond thrilled to join the ICC International Panel of Development Umpires. I owe immense gratitude to the Pakistan Cricket Board for the invaluable opportunities that paved the way for this achievement. \"The journey has been filled with hard work and personal sacrifices, but now, standing at the cusp of this new chapter, it all feels worth it,\" she said. \"This isn\u2019t just a win for me \u2013 it\u2019s a win for every aspiring female cricketer and umpire in Pakistan. I hope my success motivates countless women who dream of making their mark in the sport. This moment reflects the growing influence of women in cricket and the PCB\u2019s commitment to fostering that development. I sincerely hope to see more women follow in my footsteps and embrace this beautiful game. \u201cEver since Kainat made her debut for Pakistan in 2010, my own dream has been to represent my country at an international level. While I\u2019ve had opportunities with the Asian Cricket Council, officiating at the highest level has always been the ultimate goal. I\u2019m now focused on performing to the best of my abilities in both bilateral and ICC matches, and building my reputation as a reliable and respected match official,\" she added. Notably, the Pakistan Board also confirmed the match officials for the 2024-25 cricket season. The Board has made no change to the PCB Elite Panel of the match referees and there is no change to the ICC International Panel of Match Referees and Umpires. \"Ahmed Shahab, Khalid Mehmood Sr., Rana Muhammad Arshad and Qaiser Waheed have been promoted to the PCB Elite Panel of Umpires from the PCB Supplementary Panel of Umpires. Qaiser will replace Shozab Raza, who will retire on 31 October. The four umpires to be promoted from the development panel to the supplementary panel are: Anser Mahmood (with effect from 1 November), Jamshid Iqbal, Naseer Ahmed and Zeeshan Arif,\" the PCB said.",

It was another painful challenge for me.

Responding to questions about Vij's announcement, Pradhan reaffirmed the BJP\u2019s stance, stating that the sitting Chief Minister, Nayab Singh Saini, would remain the party's face for the top ministerial post in Haryana if the party wins the upcoming assembly polls, scheduled for October 5. The results are set to be declared on October 8. \"BJP's CM candidate is Nayab Singh Saini,\" said the BJP's Haryana Assembly election in-charge. It is noteworthy that earlier in the day, senior BJP leader and former Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said he would stake a claim for the Chief Minister\u2019s post after the October 5 Assembly polls. The six-time MLA remarked that he is the party\u2019s senior-most legislator with six election victories and is now preparing to contest his seventh. \"I have never sought anything from my party so far,\" said Vij. \"But people from across Haryana, and particularly my own constituency, have been meeting me. I will stake my claim for the Chief Minister's post,\" he added. Meanwhile, earlier in a day while announcing his decision to stake the claims over the post, the BJP Haryana leader also acknowledged that the final decision rests with the party's high command. \"It is up to the party high command to take a call,\" he said. Further, he also answered over Saini already being declared the chief ministerial candidate. Vij responded, \"There is no bar on staking a claim. I will make my claim, and let the party take a call.\"",

It is the same old anti-constitutional mindset,\" he said without taking the name of Gandhi, leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha. \"Reservation is not against meritocracy, but it is the soul of the country and the Constitution. It is an affirmative action and not negative. It is not depriving someone of opportunity but handholding those who are pillars of strength of the society,\" the Vice President said. During a recent visit to the U.S. , Mr. Gandhi, the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, said the Congress would think of scrapping reservations when \u201cIndia is a fair place\u201d, which he said is not the case right now. However, at press interaction in the U.S. later, Mr. Gandhi had said he was misquoted to show that he was against reservations. \"I have been saying again and again and again, we are going to increase reservations beyond 50%,\" Mr. Gandhi clarified. Mr. Dhankhar said it was an irony that the foreign tour was not to follow duties like protecting the sovereignty and integrity of India and respecting its Constitution but instead \"to express disrespect for the Constitution publicly\". \"The Constitution is not to be flaunted like a book. It has to be respected, read and understood. No gentleman, a wise person, or a person who respects the Constitution would ever accept such behaviour,\" he further said targeting the Congress leader. Incidentally, Mr. Gandhi, during the Lok Sabha poll campaign, would often show a copy of the abridged version of the Constitution to boost the Congress-led opposition's charge that the BJP wanted to change the Constitution and end reservations. \"The one holding a constitutional position is carrying out serialised, periodic anti-India rants on foreign soil. Can we overlook the continuous sacrileges of our Constitution? I call upon the youth to rebuff such misadventures; they hurt our motherland,\" said the Vice President. They should be ready to fight forces that disrespect the Constitution and its values, Mr. Dhankhar asserted. He criticised the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for imposing an emergency in the country on June 25, 1975, and said it was \"the darkest period of our democracy\". \"Indira Gandhi triggered an earthquake against the people and their rights by imposing Emergency. Our country suffered a lot in those 21 months. Thousands of people were jailed, the law was set aside, and that period exactly shows dictatorship. The dream of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, who wrote the Constitution, was shattered due to Emergency,\" he asserted. The current government, therefore, recognised June 25 as 'Constitution Murder Day' (Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas) to ensure the present generation does not forget the hardships faced during that \"heart-wrenching\" time, when constitutional processes were ignored, Mr. Dhankhar said. There are lessons to be learnt from such an attack on the Constitution, he added. In an attack on previous Congress governments, the VP said, \"The Mandal Commission report was submitted to the Union Government but no action was taken on it for ten years. The country saw two Prime Ministers in the same period, Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi. Both did nothing about it.\" Mr. Dhankhar recalled that he was Lok Sabha MP when Babasaheb Ambedkar was posthumously bestowed with Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian award, on March 31, 1990. \"Earlier governments had forgotten the importance of Dr. Ambedkar. The Bharat Ratna came very late for Mr. Babasaheb, which he indeed deserved,\" the VP said.

            "description": "The filmmaker, best known for the \u2018Dream Girl\u2019 franchise headlined by Ayushmann Khurrana, said he hasn\u2019t even seen the 2014 film featuring Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz",
            "content": "Director Raaj Shaandilyaa says his upcoming film \u201cVicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video\u201d, starring Rajkummar Rao and Triptii Dimri, has nothing to do with the Hollywood film \u201cSex Tape\u201d. The filmmaker, best known for the \"Dream Girl\" franchise headlined by Ayushmann Khurrana, said he hasn't even seen the 2014 film featuring Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz. \"Vicky Vidya...\" follows the titular married couple on a frantic search of a CD with a video of their wedding night, whereas \"Sex Tape\" revolves around a married couple who make a sex tape to spice up their relationship only to wake up the next morning to find that it has gone missing. Shaandilyaa said he found out that there was a film called \"Sex Tape\" after the trailer launch of \"Vicky Vidya...\", which is set in the 1990s. \"Someone asked me on Twitter, \u2018Is this film like \u2018Sex Tape\u2019? I\u2019m like, \u2018There\u2019s no sex in our film'. I was told by one of our writers that in that film their video goes viral on the Internet. The video in our film is made by the couple and they lose the CD because of their negligence. \"The characters and story are different. Our film has nothing to do with \u2018Sex Tape\u2019. I\u2019ve not even seen \u2018Sex Tape\u2019. I didn\u2019t get inspired by it, rather I got inspired by life and the people around me,\u201d the director told PTI in an interview here. He is already working on the sequel of \"Vicky Vidya...\", which will be set around the early days of the Internet. \u201cWhere this film ends, we\u2019ve got a sequel, which will be set 10-15 years later, when the advent of the Internet has happened. We\u2019ve written the story. We will shoot this film after I make another film,\u201d he added. The inspiration for \u201cVicky Vidya...\u201d came from co-writer Yusuf Ali Khan and the work on the screenplay began back in 2018, said Shaandilyaa. Prior commitments and the pandemic delayed the film's development. The filmmaker said he had initially planned to make \u201cVicky Vidya...\u201d before \u201cDream Girl 2\u201d, which released last year. Shaandilyaa said he wanted to work with \"Stree 2\" star Rao for \"the longest time\". \"However, things happen, whenever they are destined to happen. The reason why I wanted to cast Rajkummar was because I needed a middle-class boy from a small-town city. I felt he perfectly fit the bill in terms of his body language and style.\" Choosing Dimri to play Vidya stemmed from the need of a fresh pairing. \u201cFor the role of Vidya, we needed someone who had not worked with Rajkummar. He had worked with Shraddha Kapoor in \u2018Stree\u2019, with Janhvi Kapoor in \u2018Roohi\u2019 and \u2018Mr. & Mrs. Mahi\u2019. We needed a fresh pair and that\u2019s when we thought of Triptii. She is a good actor. We had signed her before the release of \u2018Animal\u2019,\u201d he said. The director, who started out as a writer on the TV show \"Comedy Circus\", said he exercises caution while penning dialogues. \u201cWhen I write, I ensure we don\u2019t talk about religion. You don\u2019t know what things could hurt people. For instance, if someone in our country loves China, he would be like how can you write the dialogue in your film, \u2018That China has attacked us 50 times\u2019. It\u2019s important to take comedy lightly, not seriously,\u201d said Shaandilyaa, whose dialogue writing credits include films such as \"Welcome Back\" and \"Jabariya Jodi\". But why set \u201cVicky Vidya...\u201d in the '90s? The filmmaker said he was driven by a desire to capture the essence of the CD era and its influence on society at the time. \u201cIn those days, men would sport long hair and that\u2019s why the look of our actors in the film is that. It\u2019s not because we were inspired by Sanjay Dutt or Amitabh Bachchan. The reason why we wanted to show the era of the '90s is that at that time, CDs were the in-thing.\u201d Shaandilyaa also revealed his plans for future projects, teasing collaborations with Khurrana, Rao, Kartik Aaryan, and Varun Dhawan. \u201cWe will make \u2018Dream Girl 3\u2019 but that\u2019s not going to be my next directorial venture. I have written about 10 scripts already. I\u2019ll direct my next film sometime in March or April, its script is ready. \u201cI\u2019ve written more stories and any of these could fit Ayushmann, Rajkummar, Kartik and Varun. All four of them have shown interest in these ideas. These are different kinds of stories from hardcore comedy, satire, black comedy, to political drama,\u201d he said. \u201cVicky Vidya...\u201d is scheduled to be released on October 11.

            "content": "Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy on Saturday said that all religious scriptures find common ground in encouraging the coming together of diverse communities to work for the progress of the country, and to bring about peace in the world. He issued a word of caution against those who spread \u2018poison\u2019 to win elections. Mr. Reddy was speaking at the launch of Prophet for the World, a book about Prophet Muhammad\u2019s life and teachings, authored by All India Muslim Personal Law Board president (AIMPLB) Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani. \u201cWhat Prophet Muhammad said, what Geeta says, what the Bible says, the message is one. That we come together and work for this country to move forward, and bring about peace in the world. In this country, some people are trying to spread poison. We should come together and think how to stop them,\u201d he said, and added that the path Prophet Muhammad showed is not only for \u201cminority community brothers\u201d, but also for the world and for those who seek to live in peace. He lauded Maulana Rahmani\u2019s effort of writing the book which he said should be read and spoken to among families about the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s path. Heaping praise on Hyderabad Parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi, Mr. Reddy said that he speaks for minority communities, Dalits, and Adivasis in Parliament. Recalling his term as a parliamentarian, Mr. Reddy said that he appreciated Mr. Owaisi speaking against the Congress. \u201cSpeaking against us doesn\u2019t make you an enemy. At times, governments make mistakes. To rectify these mistakes it requires a strong Opposition, whether in the State or the country,\u201d he said. He lamented that those who raise their voices in Parliament for the poor were few. \u201cNow in the Lok Sabha, few speak about the people. Speeches to spread poison, and to pit people against one another have increased.\u201d He said that the Congress has been acting on the suggestions of the AIMIM, and has sought their cooperation to clean up the Musi. Mr. Reddy said that in undivided Andhra Pradesh, N. Chandrababu Naidu, Y. S. Rajsekhara Reddy, and K. Chandrashekhar Rao had won two terms each. He hoped that Telangana would do the same with the Congress so that they could work for the poor, and bring about development. Maulana Rahmani said that Prophet Muhammad was a model for humanity. He said that Prophet Muhammad emphasised being good to wives, and to those who belong to other faiths, that the blood and their lives were like the lives of Muslims, and that to \u201ctake care of the religious sentiments\u201d of non-Muslims. \u201cIt is not permissible for you to speak ill and hurt the feelings of those who worship gods other than Allah,\u201d Maulana Rahmani said. Maulana Rahmani encouraged the respect for religious figures, and scriptures across faiths.

            "content": "Double Olympic medallist javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra on Sunday (September 15, 2024) revealed that he took part in the Diamond League season finale despite a hand injury sustained during a training session. On Saturday, Chopra came agonisingly close to winning the Diamond League crown before missing it by a single centimeter to finish as runner-up for the second consecutive year with a throw of 87.86m in Brussels. \"On Monday, I injured myself in practice and x-rays showed that I had fractured the fourth metacarpal in my left hand. It was another painful challenge for me. But with the help of my team, I was able to participate in Brussels,\" the 26-year-old said on his social media handle. \"This was the last competition of the year, and I wanted to end my season on the track. While I couldn\u2019t meet my own expectations, I feel this was a season in which I learned a lot. I am now determined to return, fully fit and ready to go,\" he said. Chopra had been struggling with his fitness this season and is expected to meet a doctor to rectify a groin injury that has affected him all season and came in the way of his quest to hit the elusive 90m mark. This hand injury is a new one and he did not elaborate much on it. Chopra, who added a silver to his Olympic medal tally in Paris following a historic gold at the Tokyo Games, thus ended his season on a high. Reflecting on his season, he said, \"As the 2024 season ends, I look back on everything I\u2019ve learned through the year \u2014 about improvement, setbacks, mentality and more. \"I want to thank all of you for your encouragement. 2024 has made me a better athlete and person.

Despite playing with a fresh injury, the star Indian athlete missed out on the title in Brussels by just 0.01m to Andeson Peters. After the heartbreak, the 26-year-old Neeraj shared a picture of an X-ray of his left palm which clearly shows a big crack in his metacarpals. The Paris Olympics silver medalist added that he injured his hand during practice on September 9 and said that it was a 'painful challenge' during the finals on Saturday. \"As the 2024 season ends, I look back on everything I\u2019ve learned through the year - about improvement, setbacks, mentality and more,\" Neeraj wrote in his X post on Sunday. \"On Monday, I injured myself in practice and x-rays showed that I had fractured the fourth metacarpal in my left hand. It was another painful challenge for me. But with the help of my team, I was able to participate in Brussels.\" Neeraj also talked about his disappointment for not meeting his expectations in the 2024 season after another second-place finish in a big tournament. He missed out on top spots in the Paris Olympics and three Diamond League events (Doha, Lausanne and Brussels) in 2024. \"This was the last competition of the year, and I wanted to end my season on the track. While I couldn\u2019t meet my own expectations, I feel this was a season in which I learned a lot. I am now determined to return, fully fit and ready to go. I want to thank all of you for your encouragement. 2024 has made me a better athlete and person. See you in 2025. Jai Hind,\" Neeraj added further. Neeraj's best throw of the 2024 season came in Lausanne Diamond League last month where he registered a brilliant 89.49m throw to finish second to Anderson Peters. He also reached 89.45m at the Paris Olympics to claim India's only silver and his second medal in the Summer Games.",

The sudden announcement has left many questions unanswered, prominent among them being the name of the next chief minister. Delhi Minister Atishi also reacted to the resignation announcement and said that the Aam Aadmi Party government will work for the party till it remains in power, adding that it is not important who will be the next Delhi CM. She said, \"Who will be the next Chief Minister is not important. What is important is that no matter how long the Aam Aadmi Party government stays, it will work for the people of Delhi.\" She added that Kejriwal has set a new example of honesty. She said that this is the first time in the country's politics that a leader has urged people to vote for him if they have faith in his honesty. She added that now the people of Delhi will decide as there are less than 6 months left for the Delhi elections. Atishi's reaction to the question of the next CM came amid the speculations that Sunita Kejriwal may succeed Arvind. Targeting the BJP, Atishi said, \"Ever since Kejriwal became the Chief Minister of Delhi, BJP has left no stone unturned to stop his work. He became CM with 67 seats, in May 2015 but restrictions were imposed, and illegal notification was issued through NHA, which took away all the powers. One after the other such LGs were sent, who imposed restrictions on Kejriwal. After 8 years of legal battle, the government got a decision in its favour from the Supreme Court that the elected government would have the power. \" Delhi Minister Atishi said, \"For the last two years, numerous raids were conducted, but they could not provide a single proof of corruption. BJP is afraid of elections. BJP knows that the way false accusations were made on Kejriwal, the people of Delhi are angry. BJP does not want elections because they know that the people of Delhi will express this anger through their votes. If elections were held today, the people of Delhi would not give even a single seat to BJP. All 70 seats will go to Aam Aadmi Party.\"",

            "content": "On the morning of September 12, 2024, medical officer Subhash Pavara was carrying out regular check-ups of patients at the Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Son village of Dhadgaon taluk in Maharashtra\u2019s Nandurbar district when he received an urgent call from ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) worker Sunanda Valvi. A 23-year-old woman had gone into premature labour at 32 weeks at Nandlawad, a remote hamlet cut off from roads and transport, which medical staff could reach only by traversing dirt tracks and streams for hours. \u201cThe ASHA worker, stressing the severity of the mother\u2019s condition, said it was impossible to transport her to the hospital. I immediately took my personal car and drove towards the hamlet. Due to poor network connectivity in the region, we could not contact an ambulance. I managed to reach Dhadgaon Rural Hospital and requested Dr. Babulal Pavara and Dr. Santosh Parmar, who were on duty, to arrange an ambulance. On approaching the village, we realised there was no road for a car or ambulance to reach the patient\u2019s hut,\u201d Dr. Pavara said. Nandurbar, a tribal dominated district, is located at the edge of Maharashtra\u2019s northern boundary in the Satpura hill range, with Madhya Pradesh to the north and Gujarat to the west. NITI Aayog\u2019s multi-dimensional poverty index score shows an improvement from 52.12% in 2015-16 to 33.17% in 2019-21 for the region, but the district remains the poorest in the State. Villagers here carry sick people to the nearest PHC in \u2018bamboo ambulances\u2019 or \u2018bamboo-lances\u2019 \u2014 a makeshift stretcher with two ends of bedsheets tied to bamboo sticks is a common sight. The 17 lakh population here, according to the District Collector\u2019s data, faces numerous healthcare challenges due to a scattered demographic and difficult topography.

            "content": "VHP leaders, former councillors and chief of panchayats were among 50 people booked for violence during a protest that was held here last week demanding the demolition of an illegal portion of a mosque in the Sanjauli area , police said on Sunday (September 15, 2024). Protesters clashed with security personnel on September 11, breaking barricades and pelting stones as police used water cannons and batons to disperse them. About 10 people, including police and women, were injured. Call detail records of people who instigated the protest have been gathered and more cases will be registered, the Superintendent of Police of Shimla Sanjeev Kumar Gandhi told. \"There is CCTV footage, video and photograph evidence of people carrying stones in their hands that were thrown at officers on duty,\" the officer said. The 50 people who police identified and registered eight cases so far include leaders of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), panchayat chiefs and their deputies, former councillors and shopkeepers, besides people from Chopal and Theog, officials said. The protesters have been booked under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) sections 196 (1) (promoting enmity on basis of religion); 196(2) (offence at place of worship); 189 (unlawful assembly); 126(2) (wrongful restraint); 61(2) (criminal conspiracy and assault); 353 (2) (spreading false information on religion); 223 (disobeying orders of public servants; and 132 (assaulting public servant). \"It was a pre-planned protest to disturb the peace. Those who provoked the whole incident on social media have been identified and their act and conduct endorse how they participated in the crime,\" the SP said. \"In a video, a person was seen standing on a tempo and provoking the people to break the prohibitory order under section 163 of Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS). We did not receive any application seeking permission to protest,\" he said. The SP said two police personnel sustained serious injuries, with one on the back and another on the head, and those guilty of it would be dealt with strictly as per the law. Amid tension in Shimla over the Sanjauli mosque issue, a Muslim welfare committee last Thursday offered to demolish the unauthorised part while members of the community themselves pulled down a wall of a mosque in government land in Mandi. A delegation of the welfare committee during a representation to Shimla Municipal Commissioner Bhupendra Attri said Muslims living in the locality are permanent residents of Himachal Pradesh and it was taking the step to preserve harmony and brotherhood. \"We have sought permission from the Shimla municipal commissioner to demolish the unauthorised part of the mosque situated in Sanjauli,\" member of the welfare committee Mufti Mohammad Shafi Kasmi said. Members of the Dev Bhoomi Sangarh Committee who had given the protest call against the unauthorised construction in the mosque welcomed the move. \"We welcome the move of the Muslim community and would be the first to hug them for taking this initiative in the larger interest,\" member of the samiti Vijay Sharma had said.

Having 488 to defend, Kotian and Mulani led the way with an impressive bowling display to hand India A 186-run win at the Rural Development Trust Stadium, Anantapur. With their backs against the wall and a tall target to climb, Shreyas Iyer's India D had a task cut out for them. They began the run-chase at the end of Day 3 and lost Atharva Taide before the stumps on the penultimate day. India D started the final day on 62/1 with Bhui and Yash Dubey unbeaten. The Delhi Capitals batter Bhui displayed a brilliant fight alongside a couple of mini fightbacks from captain Iyer and Sanju Samson. Bhui smashed 113 from 195 balls, laced with 14 fours and three sixes. While he kept the fight from one end, there was little resistance from the other end with the two spinners doing their job. They extracted turn from the footmarks on the final day and got their rewards. Off-spinner Tanush Kotian bagged four wickets, getting the scalps of Bhui, Saransh Jain, Saurabh Kumar and Harshit Rana. Left-arm spinner Mulani took three in the innings, removing Devdutt Padikkal, Shreyas Iyer and Samson. With this win, India A have opened their account in the Duleep Trophy points table. For their outright win, the -led side has bagged six points. Meanwhile, India D have been knocked out of the reckoning as they have lost both games and are on zero points. India C lead the four-team table with nine points. They won the first match against the D side and played a draw against India B in the second round. However, with their first-innings lead, India C took three points from the tied contest. India B are in second place with seven points as they have a win and a draw after the first-inning trail.",

            "description": "The incident on Saturday occurred nearly two weeks after a boat carrying migrants ripped apart in the English Channel as they attempted to reach Britain from northern France",
            "content": "At least eight people died during a failed attempt to cross the English Channel from northern France, French maritime authorities said on Sunday (September 15, 2024). The incident occurred on Saturday (September 14, 2024) just before midnight when authorities spotted a boat, carrying dozens, in distress near a beach in the northern town of Ambleteuse. A French rescue ship was deployed to the area and rescue services offered medical assistance to 53 migrants on the beach, a statement from the French maritime authorities in charge of the Channel and the North Sea said. \u201cDespite the emergency care provided, eight people have died,\u201d the statement said. No people were discovered during the search at sea, it added. Six people were taken to hospital \u201cin relative emergency,\u201d including a 10-month-old baby with hypothermia, Jacques Billant, the Pas-de-Calais prefect, told French media on Sunday. He said survivors of the accident come from Eritrea, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt and Iran. Survivors of the tragedy have been taken to the sports hall in Ambleteuse, according to a statement from the prefecture of Pas-de-Calais region. Prosecutor's office in Boulogne-sur-mer has opened an investigation into the accident. The incident on Saturday occurred nearly two weeks after a boat carrying migrants ripped apart in the English Channel as they attempted to reach Britain from northern France, plunging dozens into the treacherous waterway and leaving 12 dead, officials said. British officials were quick to express sadness over another English Channel incident. \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u2019\u2019 Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a further loss of life.\u201d The new Labour Party government has pledged to crack down on criminal gangs plying the channel trade and had discussed with European partners \u201chow we go after those gangs, in co-operation upstream.\u2019\u2019 Europe\u2019s increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants have been pushing them north. Before Saturday\u2019s accident, at least 43 migrants had died or gone missing while trying to cross to the U.K. this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. Other surveillance and rescue operations are underway on Sunday along the entire Pas-de-Calais coast amid stormy weather conditions and agitated sea, French maritime authorities said. They warned anyone who tries to cross the Channel on flimsy and overloaded boats and in often difficult weather conditions of \u201csignificant risks.\u201d On Saturday, French coast guard and navy vessels rescued 200 people from the treacherous waters in the Pas-de-Calais area, according to a report sent by French maritime authorities in charge of the Channel and the North Sea. They said they observed 18 attempts of boat departures from France to Britain on Saturday. In July, four migrants died while attempting the crossing on an inflatable boat that capsized and punctured. Five others, including a child, died in another attempt in April. Five dead were recovered from the sea or found washed up along a beach after a migrant boat ran into difficulties in the dark and winter cold of January.

            "content": "The Nilgiris forest division detained a farmer for using snares on his property in a bid to capture wild game on Saturday (September 14, 2024). Forest Department officials from the Kattabettu forest range in Kotagiri said that they were on a routine patrol in Bikkapathy beat on Friday (September 13, 2024), when they discovered a few snares that had been laid on a private land. They suspect that the snares were being used to trap small game, including black-naped hare. However, officials said that the snares could not only kill or main small mammals but also larger species, including leopards and tigers. In the recent past, multiple instances of leopards, tigers, and sloth bears becoming trapped in snares and dying as a result have been reported. Following the finding of the snares, the Forest Department detained a man who had leased the land from its original owner and was farming on it. They identified him as Murthy (30). They detained Murthy and conducted inquiries. During the course of their investigation, Murthy confessed to laying the snares on his property. The Forest Department imposed a fine of \u20b925,000 on Murthy and let him off with a warning. Officials said that they had increased patrolling in all forest ranges in the Nilgiris division, in an effort to clampdown on poaching. Man arrested for using gelatin sticks for well construction. In a separate incident, the Kolacombai police in the Nilgiris arrested Suresh Kumar, for using gelatin sticks for the construction of a well on his property. Local residents had informed the police of the use of explosives, and police launched an investigation. They arrested and remanded Suresh Kumar.

            "content": "Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's announcement to resign from the CM post created a political stir in the national capital on Sunday. After Kejriwal's surprise statement, many questions are being raised, to answer these questions, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh spoke to India TV. He frankly responded to every question related to the latest development in Delhi politics. On the question of resigning after six months, Singh said, \"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were breaking parties in state after state, toppling governments, BJP has such a history, that is why Kejriwal did not resign for six months,\" He asserted that now Kejriwal is going among the public, the public will decide on his post. If he was greedy for the post, he would not have resigned from his job, the MP said, adding the people of Delhi would made him win with a huge majority again. Kejriwal gave a profitable budget even after all the work he did in Delhi and if he was dishonest, he would not have made a profitable budget. Taking a dig at the BJP, he said, \"In 2013, AAP government was formed for 5 years. But Kejriwal resigned in just 49 days. Only Kejriwal has such courage. The BJP leaders wanted to break the party, wanted to topple the government, if this experiment had been successful, they would have done the same experiment in the whole country, so Kejriwal decided to fight by not giving up. When it came to going to the public's court, he openly said people will decide whether I am guilty or honest.\" On the questions about resigning due to the bail conditions imposed by the Supreme Court, Singh said, \"The BJP left no stone unturned to create obstacles in the work of the Delhi government, despite this, all the work was completed. The obstacle of the conditions imposed by the Supreme Court does not matter at all. Kejriwal will form the government again with a certificate from the people's court and a massive majority. Kejriwal ji is out now, the entire control over the party will now be under his leadership. BJP's attempts failed in the past and will fail in the future too. The name of the next CM will be decided in the meeting of the party's legislative party.'",

            "content": "Plastic surgery requires careful consideration of motives, procedures, and long-term effects to ensure successful outcomes. Here are 10 things to keep in mind before making your decision! Plastic surgery is more than just a way to enhance physical appearance; it\u2019s a medical procedure that requires thoughtful consideration and preparation. Whether you're opting for reconstructive surgery or cosmetic enhancement, plastic surgery involves intricate procedures that can have long-lasting effects on both your physical and emotional well-being. According to Dr. Vipul Nanda, Chief of Cosmetic & Plastic Surgery at Artemis Hospital, Gurgaon, plastic surgery should never be taken lightly. With years of experience in the field, Dr. Nanda emphasizes the importance of understanding the complexity of these procedures. He advises patients to carefully assess their reasons for undergoing surgery and be fully aware of the potential outcomes and risks involved. 10 Essential Things To Know Before Deciding On Plastic Surgery: 1. Be Clear about Your Motives: Before undergoing plastic surgery, it's crucial to understand why you want the procedure. Ensure your decision is driven by personal reasons rather than societal pressures or fleeting trends. Clarity of purpose will lead to more satisfying results. 2. Research the Procedure: Thoroughly research the specific procedure you're considering. This includes understanding techniques, potential risks, complications, expected outcomes, and recovery. Being informed helps manage your expectations. 3. Choose the Right Surgeon: Choosing a qualified, experienced surgeon is key. Look for a board-certified plastic surgeon with a strong track record. Consulting multiple surgeons can provide a broader perspective, helping you find the right match for your needs. 4. Realistic Expectations: Plastic surgery can enhance your appearance, but it won\u2019t resolve personal or psychological issues. It\u2019s essential to have realistic expectations. Discuss potential outcomes with your surgeon to align your goals with achievable results. 5. Understand the Risks: Every surgery comes with risks, and plastic surgery is no exception. Complications like infection, scarring, or anaesthesia reactions can occur. Make sure to discuss these risks thoroughly with your surgeon during consultations. 6. Costs and Financing: Plastic surgery can be costly, and most procedures aren\u2019t covered by insurance unless they're medically necessary. Be sure to understand all costs involved, including post-operative care, and explore financing options if needed. 7. Recovery Time: Recovery times vary depending on the procedure. Be prepared for time off work and limitations on physical activities. Following your surgeon's post-op instructions is crucial for optimal recovery and results. 8. Long-Term Commitment: Some procedures require long-term maintenance. For example, breast implants may need replacement after several years, and facelifts could require touch-ups. Be aware of these commitments before proceeding. 9. Physical Health Assessment: Your overall health plays a significant role in surgery outcomes and recovery. Ensure you're in good physical health before undergoing any procedure. Your surgeon will likely conduct a comprehensive health assessment to determine your eligibility for surgery. 10. Emotional Preparedness: Plastic surgery can impact your emotional well-being and body image. Make sure you're emotionally prepared for the changes and seek support from friends, family, or mental health professionals during the recovery phase. In conclusion, plastic surgery requires thorough thought and preparation. By understanding your motives, selecting the right surgeon, setting realistic expectations, and considering the risks, costs, and recovery, you can make a well-informed decision that aligns with your goals and well-being. Both physical and emotional readiness are key to a positive surgical experience and satisfying outcomes.",

            "content": "The Boeing Starliner faced issues that ultimately forced NASA to send the spacecraft back to Earth without Sunita Williams, Butch Wilmore. NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore recently shed light on why Boeing's Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth without them. Initially scheduled for a short eight-day mission, the astronauts had to adapt to a much longer stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS) after Starliner experienced technical difficulties. Starliner\u2019s Technical Issues Force Empty Return The Boeing Starliner faced issues that ultimately forced NASA to send the spacecraft back to Earth without its intended crew. Although the spacecraft experienced helium leaks and propulsion concerns, it landed successfully. Wilmore explained, \"We could have gotten to the point where we could have returned on Starliner, but we simply ran out of time.\" NASA made the decision to return the Starliner empty in early September, prioritizing the need to free up the docking port for other spacecraft. Williams expressed relief at the spacecraft's safe return, saying, \"I was so happy it got home with no problems.\" The availability of SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon as an alternative played a crucial role in the decision-making process. Wilmore highlighted this advantage: \"There\u2019s many cases in the past where there have not been other options.\" Both astronauts plan to return to Earth in 2025 aboard the Crew Dragon. Wilmore said,\" Obviously, when you have issues like we\u2019ve had, there\u2019s some changes that need to be made. Boeing\u2019s on board with that. We\u2019re all on board with that.\u201d Acknowledging the risks inherent in testing new spacecraft, Wilmore said, \u201cWhen you do things with spacecraft that have never been done before, just like Starliner, you\u2019re going to find some things. In this case, we found some things that we just could not get comfortable with.\" Despite the unexpected length of their stay in space, Williams remains upbeat. \"This is my happy place. I love being up here in space. It\u2019s just fun,\" she shared.",

India\u2019s star speedster Mohammed Shami said that he is in no mood to rush himself back to the field ahead of the heavy Test calendar.

The Indian team is set to take part in ten Test matches in the next five months including two against Bangladesh, and three against New Zealand at home. They will then head to Australia to play in a five-match series beginning on November 22. \"Koshish jaldi hi kar raha hoon kyun ke main janta hoon kaafi time ho gaya hai team se bahar rehte hue (I am slogging hard to return soon because I know I have been out of action for quite some time). However, I want to ensure there is no discomfort when I return. I've to work on my fitness, so that there is no discomfort,\" Shami spoke to reporters at the Cricket Association of Bengal's (CAB) annual awards ceremony. \"The stronger I return, the better it is for me. I don't want to rush and risk getting injured again, be it against Bangladesh, New Zealand or the Australia series. I've already started bowling, but I won't take any chances until I am 100% fit,\u201d he added. As per reports, Shami is likely to take part in the upcoming Ranji Trophy 2024-25 for Bengal. Talking about the Indian team, they are set to play in the two-match Test series against Bangladesh, starting from September 19 at the M Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.",

Be it Maryada Purushottam Ram or Gautam Buddha. Whenever allegations have been made against a respectable and honest person, he has had to go through Agnipariksha,\" Chadha said. \"CM Kejriwal has himself chosen this Agnipariksha for himself,\" he added. Chadha, further speaking to India TV, also expressed confidence that Kejriwal will return as Delhi's Chief Minister in 2025 with a decisive mandate. He emphasized that in an era where resignations in politics are rare, Kejriwal\u2019s decision to step down from his post demonstrates his integrity and commitment to the truth. \"We live in a time where hardly anyone resigns, not even from minor posts, let alone MPs or ministers. Kejriwal\u2019s decision to resign shows his honesty and readiness to face the public\u2019s judgment.\" Chadha added. Meanwhile, drawing a parallel to the 2020 Delhi elections, the AAP MP recalled how Kejriwal urged voters to support him only if they believed he had worked for their welfare. Looking ahead to the 2025 elections, Chadha reiterated that Kejriwal has placed his political future in the hands of the people now also. \"If the public deems him honest, they will press the broom button again. I am confident that Arvind Kejriwal will be back as Chief Minister in February 2025,\" Chadha concluded.",

PM Modi In Jharkhand: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday lashed out at the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-led coalition in Jharkhand and said that the JMM is standing with Bangladeshis and Rohingyas, and these infiltrators and extremists are taking over the CM Hemant Soren-led party. He also said that infiltrators from the neighbouring country are a major threat to Jharkhand as they are changing the demography of the Santhal Parganas and Kolhan regions of the state. While addressing the 'Parivartan Maharally' of the Bharatiya Janata Party at Gopal Maidan in Jamshedpur, PM Modi said, \"Bangladeshi and Rohingya infiltrators have become a major threat to Santhal Parganas and Kolhan regions. The demography of these regions is changing fast. The tribal population is on the decline. The infiltrators are establishing control of the panchayat system, grabbing land, indulging in atrocities on daughters of the state...Each Jharkhand resident is feeling unsafe\". The Prime Minister was on a visit to Jharkhand on Sunday. He flagged-off six Vande Bharat trains at Tatanagar Junction Railway Station in Jamshedpur. He virtually launched the Tatanagar-Patna Vande Bharat train. During his speech, PM Modi termed the JMM, RJD, and Congress the \"biggest enemies of Jharkhand,\" asserting that these parties were \"power-hungry\" and \"indulged in vote bank politics\". He also alleged that the JMM was \"supporting infiltrators,\" and the fact was that \"illegal immigrants from the neighbouring country managed to establish influence\" over the ruling party in the state. The Prime Minister took a pot shot at the Congress and said that the ghost of the grand old party has taken over the JMM, and when this happens, appeasement becomes the only agenda of that party. \"In Santhal Pargana, the Adivasi population is decreasing rapidly. The lands are being grabbed. Infiltrators are taking over positions in panchayats. The incidents of crime against daughters are increasing... Every Jharkhandi is feeling unsafe because of the infiltrators... The JMM is standing with Bangladeshis and Rohingyas... These infiltrators and extremists are taking over the JMM... This has happened because the ghost of Congress has entered the JMM... When the ghost of Congress enters any party, then appeasement becomes the only agenda of that party... These parties want to form their vote bank based on religion,\" PM Modi said during the rally. #WATCH | Jamshedpur, Jharkhand: PM Modi says, \"...In Santhal Pargana, the Adivasi population is decreasing rapidly.

Every Jharkhandi is... pic.twitter.com/ECYnXNID83 \u2014 ANI (@ANI) September 15, 2024 Continuing his attack at the JMM and the Congress, PM Modi said, \"The JMM-led government has been trained by Congress' school of corruption. It is time to bid farewell to the JMM that looted mines, minerals, and Army land.\" The Prime Minister, who was scheduled to reach Jamshedpur via a chopper, had to travel to the steel city on the road as his helicopter could not take off due to inclement weather conditions. \"No obstacles, including heavy rain, could prevent me from reaching you, I am touched by your affection,\" he said. He also asserted that the saffron party is set to come to power in the state after the assembly polls due later this year. \"If the BJP comes to power, it will launch a probe into deaths of aspirants during excise constable recruitment drive,\" he said. PM Modi accused the JMM-led coalition of targeting BJP leaders and framing false cases against them. (With agencies inputs)",

Panneerselvam on Sunday (September 15, 2024) criticised the DMK government over various demands of the associations for the differently-abled that he said have remained unmet. He insisted on Chief Minister to implement welfare measures to protect their livelihoods. \u201cIt would not be sufficient if it remains in paper that special focus is accorded for differently-abled and that a separate department has been created for their welfare and that it is with the Chief Minister. They should come into force and should be implemented,\u201d Mr. Panneerselvam said in a statement. Referring to the recent protests staged by associations of the differently-abled, Mr. Panneerselvam said they were the latest after farmers, industrialists, government employees, teachers, doctors, nurses, traders, youth and students who have staged protests under the DMK regime. Allocation of space for setting up Aavin milk parlours in government offices, allocation of 5% of space in commercial complexes under urban local bodies, allowing carts for running small businesses, increasing the monthly aid to them, regularising the services of part-time teachers, were among the demands of these associations.

            "content": "Ahead of the India-Bangladesh Test series, Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto expressed confidence after their Pakistan series win. IND vs BAN: Ahead of the two-match Test series against India, Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto said that his side wants to win both the long-format matches. The two-match Test series between India and Bangladesh will kick off on September 19 at Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium. Currently, Bangladesh are in top form as they have whitewashed Pakistan 2-0, winning their first test series on Pakistani soil. The Bengal Tigers clinched a massive 10-wicket victory over Pakistan in the first Test match. While in the second long-format match, they won it by six wickets. Speaking at the pre-departure press conference in Dhaka, Najmul accepted that it will be a challenging series against India. However, he added that the Bengal Tigers are having \"extra confidence\" after win over Pakistan in Test series. \"It will be a challenging series but we have the extra confidence from the Pakistan series. I guess the whole country has that confidence now. Every series is an opportunity. We want to win both Tests, but we have to stick to our process. If we do our job, we can get a good result,\" Najmul Hossain was quoted by ESPNcricinfo as saying. The Bangladesh skipper talked about their goals during their tour of India.\"They are well ahead of us in the rankings. But we did play well recently. We want to play well for five days, that's our goal. We want to get the result in the last session of the Test match. At that time, the match can go in any direction. It is an opportunity [to get our first win in India]. We will play with a win in mind. But we don't want to think too far ahead. We want to do well for five days, and play to our strength. That's most important,\" he added. Najmul Hossain further added that Bangladesh have a good bowling attack, who can bowl at any condition. \"We are in a good place with our bowling attack, both spin and pace. Perhaps our pacers are behind them in terms of experience but our spin attack is close to theirs. They can bowl in any conditions. All I can say is that our pacers, spinners and batters will give 100%,\" he further added. The second Test between India and Bangladesh will be held in Kanpur, which will be played from September 27. Currently, Team India are leading the WTC standings with a point percentage of 68.52, and their upcoming series in the WTC include Bangladesh (two Tests, home), New Zealand (three Tests, home), and Australia (five Tests, away).

            "content": "Ruturaj Gaikwad played another impressive innings as India B and India C shared points in the Duleep Trophy 2024 second-round fixtures on Sunday, September 15. India C declared their second innings on 128/4 as umpires called for early stumps on Day 4 in Anatapur. Both teams failed to overcome each other with huge first innings totals and played out for a draw to earn some crucial points. India C's 525 in the first innings helped them earn three crucial points to take a lead in the table after second-round fixtures at Duleep Trophy. Staring last day from 309/7, India C managed to add just 23 more runs to their second innings total. Captain Abhimanyu Easwaran remained unbeaten on 157 runs to help his team avoid a follow-on by just seven runs. After picking five wickets on Day 3, the young pacer Anshul Kamboj took all three wickets on Sunday to bowl out India C to 332 in 108 overs. Anshul emerged as the best bowler with eight wickets for just 69 while Vijaykumar Vyshak and Mayank Markande picked one each for India B. India B lost struggling Sai Sudharsan early but Ruturaj and Rajat Patidar added 96 runs for the second wicket to avoid a collapse. Gaikwad top-scored with 62 runs off 93 balls and Patidar scored 42 runs to show some glimpses of returning to form. Ishan Kishan failed to carry the momentum from his first innings century as he was bowled out for just one run by Rahul Chahar. Anshul Kamboj was awarded the Player of the Match award for scoring 38 runs and for producing his career-best First-Class figures of 8 for 69.",

            "description": "The Lok Sabha MP expressed pride in the resilience of the Kashmiri people, emphasising that they are not beggars in need of mercy.",
            "content": "Lok Sabha MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid has strongly dismissed allegations that he serves as a proxy for the BJP and asserted that his electoral success in the general elections was a reflection of the public's sentiments against the Modi government's 'Naya Kashmir' initiative. In an interview with PTI videos, Mr. Rashid, popularly known as Engineer Rashid, said those labelling him as a BJP proxy should be \"ashamed of themselves,\" as he considers himself the only mainstream leader to have faced persecution from the ruling party. Mr. Rashid also criticised former chief ministers Omar Abdullah of the National Conference (NC) and Mehbooba Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), claiming both failed the people of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 by the central government in August 2019. \"The people who accuse me of being a BJP proxy should feel ashamed. I am the only one who was victimised by the BJP. While Omar and Mehbooba were kept in SKICC for several months during the abrogation, I was the only MLA jailed in Tihar,\" he said. \"He (Abdullah) could neither become (Mahatma) Gandhi nor Subash Chandra Bose and same way Mehbooba neither became (queen) Razia Sultan nor Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar. They are puppets, rubber stamps...\" Rashid, who defeated Abdullah in the Baramulla Lok Sabha seats by over two lakh votes, said. Arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in 2019 on charges related to terror funding, Rashid was granted interim bail on September 10 to campaign for the candidates of his Awami Itehad Party until October 2. The Lok Sabha MP expressed pride in the resilience of the Kashmiri people, emphasising that they are not beggars in need of mercy. Talking about his victory, he said, \"It was a vote for the work I did in Langate, and also for the sentiment I represented on their behalf inside the assembly,\" he explained. He criticised the central government's actions, particularly the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, saying, \"It was a vote against the atrocities that Narendra Modi inflicted on me and every Kashmiri.\" He asserted that the people's commitment to their rights and identity remains strong, making it clear that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of \"Naya Kashmir\" is not acceptable to them. Expressing frustration over the Centre's actions and questioning its motives, Rashid said, \"Was the central government afraid of me? I have endured personal hardships and have been separated from my family for years. Meanwhile, Omar Abdullah has a history of aligning with the BJP, and Mehbooba\u2019s party has acted as a launch pad for BJP policies.\" He lamented that the BJP has achieved its goals, including the abrogation of Article 370, and warned that any collaboration with the central government could lead to further losses for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Targeting Abdullah, Rashid said, \"While Omar plays golf and enjoys holidays abroad, he has never called for a peaceful protest against the abrogation of Article 370.\" He also criticised the former chief ministers for their participation in rallies for leaders like Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is facing corruption charges, but remained silent on the plight of Kashmiris incarcerated within and outside the region. \"I am heartbroken as I witness the suffering of my fellow Kashmiris. The likes of Altaf Fantosh have died in Tihar jail, and the situation has been dire for many others,\" he said. Mr. Rashid referred to Mr. Abdullah as the \"Prince of Gupkar,\" suggesting that the leader of the 'Gupkar alliance' was disconnected from the ground realities faced by the people. With a political career spanning over a decade, including significant time spent in jail, Rashid asserted his readiness to account for his actions and urged those who have misled the people of Kashmir to take responsibility for the ongoing struggles faced by the community. He said by reflecting on the need for genuine political change \"real politicians bring about positive change. If you find yourself in Tihar, it should not be seen as a weakness but a strength, as it shows that despite the odds, people continue to support you.\" Mr. Rashid emphasised the importance of standing up to a system that he claims has consistently let the people of Jammu and Kashmir down. \"Obviously, you have to get up (and protest) against the system which has bulldozed your rights,\" he said. Mr. Rashid reflected on the support he has received from the public despite the challenges posed by state machinery and institutional opposition. \"If I was in Tihar, it would be my strength because, despite all this, people voted for me,\" he noted. \"Nobody can suppress the people, and nobody can go and check whom they vote for. At least that much legitimacy in the system is still there,\" he said. He urged the public to remember their responsibilities while fighting for their rights. \"I asked people that while seeking your rights, you should not forget your duties,\" he said, highlighting his commitment to integrity in governance. \"I was the only man who did not promise fake (free) electricity in my manifesto. I want to make people morally emboldened; their character should be displayed.\" Published - September 15, 2024 03:57 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Jammu and Kashmir Assembly Elections 2024 / Jammu and Kashmir National Conference / Jammu and Kashmir / Bharatiya Janata Party",

            "content": "In the ongoing tiff between the Congress Government led by Siddaramaiah and the Raj Bhavan, the Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot has fired another salvo against the State Government by seeking details of prosecution sanction given by State Government against officials facing corruption charges since May 2023. In a communique to the Chief Secretary Shalini Rajaneesh on September 5, the Governor sought to know prosecution sanction given by the State Government based on the request of the Lokayukta that is probing charges of corruption against the officials. He has also given a format to the chief secretary to provide details of cases that have come before the Government after May 20, 2023 when the Congress Government was formed. He has sought details of the cabinet recommendation, date of submission, decision taken by the cabinet, nature of punishment if accepted and reasons for rejection, if rejected. Based on the Governor\u2019s letter, the vigilance cell in the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms on September 10 has asked all department heads to furnish details of the Lokayuktha\u2019s request for sanction for prosecution \u2018urgently\u2019. The departments have been given a week\u2019s time to provide details., which will end this week. Governor\u2019s move is being seen as another strategy to corner the Congress Government, which had asked the prosecution sanction status against the Opposition BJP and Janata Dal (Secular) leaders including Union Minister for Heavy Industries H.D. Kumaraswamy, former Ministers and BJP leaders G. Janardhan Reddy, Shashikala Jolle and Murugesh Nirani that were pending before the Governor. The Cabinet decision and later Congress protest had followed the earlier sanction for prosecution given by the Governor against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who is facing charges in the alleged irregularities in distribution of sites in Mysure Urban Development Authority (MUDA) in which his wife Parvathi is a beneficiary. Since then, the Government is on a war path with the Governor, accusing him of acting on the behest of the Centre to destabilise the democratically elected Congress Government in State. The tiff also accentuated with the Governor sending back 11 bills passed by the State Legislature with queries. Three of the 11 bills have received Governor\u2019s assent after Government sent clarification. \u201cDuring the perusal of the Cabinet decision taken by the State Government, I observed in some of the Lokayuktha cases in which sanction of various officers of the State Government. I also observed that in some cases State Government has rejected the proposal of the Lokayuktha and in a few cases has given sanction. Further, in a few with a warning cases have been rejected,\u201d he said in his letter to the Chief Secretary. Further, he said: \u201cIn this regard, I desire to know the details of these cases and also to know on what basis the decision has been taken in these cases. Hence, it is instructed to submit the details of the proposals received from the Karnataka Lokayuktha for want of sanction against officials of the State Government in the attached form from May 20,2023 to till date.\u201d Published - September 15, 2024 03:56 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Karnataka / politics",

            "content": "India will start their upcoming international season with a two-Test series against Bangladesh in Chennai from September 19 followed by the second match in Kanpur starting September 27. India vice-captain Shubman Gill is among the prominent players who will be rested for the three-match T20I series against Bangladesh starting October 7 as part of BCCI's workload management policy. Gill, India's No.3 in Test matches, is a vital cog in the team's top-order alongside Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Yashasvi Jaiswal and is expected to play all 10 Tests this season. Apart from Gill, a few more important players will also be rested keeping the the three-Test series against New Zealand in mind. India will start their upcoming international season with a two-Test series against Bangladesh in Chennai from September 19 followed by the second match in Kanpur starting September 27. \"Yes, Shubman will be rested for the Bangladesh T20I series. If you look at the fixture, the three T20Is will be played on October 7 (Gwalior), 10 (Delhi) and 13 (Hyderabad). Now first Test vs New Zealand starts on October 16. \"So with a turnaround of three days, it is important to give Gill a break,\" a BCCI source told PTI on the condition of anonymity. Gill has so far played 21 T20Is and has a hundred, three fifties to his credit besides a strike rate of nearly 140. He was recently appointed captain for the five-match series against Zimbabwe in Harare, which India won 4-1. In the current season, T20Is are the least priority for the Indian team with the World Test Championship points with the five-match series against Australia being topmost on the agenda. Also, ODIs will be important as there is a Champions Trophy to be played in that format from February to March. It is understood that most of the Test team players are unlikely to be played against Bangladesh in T20Is. While the troika of Rohit, Virat, and Ravindra Jadeja have retired from the shortest format, pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj also will be given rest as per workload management requirements. It will be interesting to see if Rishabh Pant plays T20Is, as his workload is paramount for selectors and he is needed in longer formats. In case Pant is rested, there could be a possibility that Ishan Kishan is once again reconsidered after having spent the nine months of this year in the international wilderness.",

            "content": "India's foreign exchange reserves have been increased by $66 billion this year as it continue to rise for months, hitting several all-time highs. India's forex kitty is currently at $ 689.235 billion. Moreover, the latest RBI data, the largest component of forex reserves, foreign currency assets (FCA) was at USD 604,144 points. Additionally, Gold reserves are currently worth USD 61.988 billion. The huge forex acts as a buffer to keep domestic economic activity unaffected by global shocks. According to estimates, India's current forex is sufficient to cover about a year of projected imports. Notably, in the year 2023, the country added about $ 58 billion to its forex. In contrast, India's foreign exchange reserves saw a decline of $ 71 billion in 2022. Given that, the current trend showcases India's robust economic management and rising exports. Forex reserves, or foreign exchange reserves (FX reserves), are assets held by a nation's central bank or monetary authority. Foreign exchange reserves are generally held in reserve currencies, typically the US Dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling. With due consideration, the forex markets are closely monitored by the RBI, which intervenes only to maintain orderly market conditions. The prime goal for such an intervention is to contain excessive volatility in the exchange rate without reference to any pre-determined target level or band. The RBI intervenes in the market through liquidity management which also includes the sale of dollars, to prevent a depreciation in the rupee. Currently, Indian Rupee has gained a reputation as one of the most stable currencies in Asia. In contrast, the Rupee was one of the most volatile currencies a decade ago. (With ANI Inputs)",

            "content": "Pakistan white-ball captain has been struggling for the form of late and the noise has been from all corners. Babar has gone without scoring a fifty in two back-to-back assignments, T20 World Cup and the Bangladesh Test series with his last half-century coming in May against Ireland. Since Pakistan couldn'tgo past the group stage in the T20 World Cup, his captaincy is also under dark clouds and former cricketer Younis Khan has advised him to focus on performances rather than captaincy and leadership. Younis gave 's example saying that the Indian superstar has been in tremendous since leaving captaincy and that Babar might learn from him. \"There are high expectations from Babar. Players should use social media wisely, but their real answers should come through their performances with the bat and ball. He (Babar) needs to focus on his fitness and work ethic because opportunities like these don't come around often,\u201d Younis said at the press conference for Karachi Premier League. \"He has achieved a lot at such a young age, but what he needs to know what he wants to achieve in the future. Captaincy is a small thing, performance is what matters. Look at Virat Kohli. He chose to step down from captaincy on his own terms, and now he\u2019s breaking records worldwide. This shows that playing for the country should be the priority. If there\u2019s any energy left, then play for yourself,\" he added. Babar returned scores of 31, 22, 0 and 11 in four innings against Bangladesh while many labelled his poor returns in the T20 World Cup as one of the major reasons for Pakistan's lacklustre performance in the tournament. Kohli, on the other hand, has gotten past his dry run in 2022 following leaving the captaincy across all three formats for India, and is amid a sensational run. Younis said that he has observed many Pakistani players talk more than they perform and just performing and helping their side win games of cricket should be their main focus. \"The only suggestion I have for Babar is that he should focus on his cricket. He should up his performance. Babar Azam was made the captain because he was the best player at the time. I was there when the decision was made that the team\u2019s best player should be the captain,\" Younis said during an event in Pakistan. \u201cIf Babar and other top players deliver on the field, then results will be clear to everyone. I have observed that our players tend to talk more than they perform,\" he added.",

He said that those divisive forces peddling the narrative of unity are against social justice and equality. \u201cThey are enemies of society. Unless we defeat them, rights and opportunities for women, Dalits, and backward classes cannot be established. The BJP and divisive forces with them are opposed to the poor and middle class, and they do not allow implementation of the pro-poor programmes. We have to defeat them,\u201d the Chief Minister said in Bengaluru after launching the human chain to mark the International Day of Democracy. Government officials formed a human chain in front of the DC\u2019s office in Shivamogga on Sunday.| Photo Credit:Sathish G.T \u201cThe fact that 20 lakh people have joined together to form a human chain itself is a warning to the destructive forces and symbolises unity in society,\u201d he added. As part of the International Day of Democracy, a 2,500-kilometer-long human chain was formed from Bidar to Chamarajanagar and covered all 31 districts. The Chief Minister had termed the human chain as the longest one that will spread the aspirations of democracy. \u201cLet us celebrate pluralism that has been upheld by the Constitution and through this, let us defeat the conspiracy to divide society. Democracy existed during the times of Buddha and Basavanna and Anubhava Mantapa is a symbol of democracy,\u201d he said Further, he said, \u201cThe preamble of the Constitution has big values, and that is why we are making efforts to ensure that it is read in all educational students. Proponents of democracy should rise to defeat the divisive forces that provide unity as an alibi.\u201d Urging for a peaceful society, he said, \u201cWe should try to establish peace in our land and become what has been envisaged for the country and Karnataka in the national and state anthem. Unless inequality is eradicated in society, independence for the country will have no value. Our government has formulated policies to achieve equality among all castes and communities and the poor and rich.\u201d Published - September 15, 2024 03:37 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit bengaluru / democracy",

            "content": "P olitical leadership significantly influences the development of societies and nations. Over the past century, many nations have undergone transformative changes from recognising human rights irrespective of caste, creed, or gender, to driving economic growth and prosperity for larger populations. In India, the 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments have decentralised funds, functions, and functionaries to local bodies such as municipalities and Panchayati Raj institutions. Decisions made at these levels impact millions of lives daily. Political leadership is crucial to understand citizen challenges, devise feasible solutions, involve impacted stakeholders, and implement optimal solutions. Effective decision-making, negotiation, and governance are vital for leaders. At the local level, leaders such as mayors and panchayat presidents tackle immediate concerns such as infrastructure development and essential public services. State and Union government leaders address broader issues such as economic policy, defence preparedness, cooperative federalism, and international affairs. At every level, politicians are expected to uphold societal expectations. Education The debate over the necessity of formal education for political leaders continues but there is growing acceptance that a structured educational background benefits decision-making. Politicians need an interdisciplinary mindset to understand and resolve various issues affecting their constituents. Political communication is crucial, encompassing verbal and written communication, advertising, branding, social media management, and public relations. Effective constituency management is essential for MPs and legislators, involving strategic campaign planning, media utilisation, research, data analysis, and psephology. Hands-on learning through internships with political parties or leaders helps internalise theoretical knowledge through practical application. Internships should lay emphasis on working with social organisations, election survey and campaign, and working with political leaders and parties. Keeping in line with the emerging demand from politicians and academicians, key areas of study should comprise: Competing Politico-Economic Ideologies, Legislative Procedures in India, Politics for Change, Working of Indian Constitution, Organisation Building and Strategic Management, Constituency Development and Management, Transformative Leadership: Sharing Best Practices, Local Governments in India, Elections and Campaign Management, Budget Making and Analysis, Psephology and Data Analytics, Political Communication, India\u2019s Foreign Policy, Rural Immersion, Participatory Methods for Political Leadership, Public Policy and Advocacy, Biographies of leaders around the world, Global Politics, and Film Appreciation. Skills required Successful political leaders possess skills such as leadership, strategic vision, team management, effective communication, negotiation, analytical thinking, policy-making, and problem-solving. These enable leaders to craft evidence-based solutions to pressing issues. In recent years, India\u2019s negotiation of farm laws have highlighted the need for a persuasive approach rather than a hard-line stance. Political leadership and government careers are becoming more formalised. Winning elections can lead to roles as corporators, legislators, or parliamentarians. Beyond elected positions, roles such as advisors, officers on special duty, and subject-matter specialists are available. Becoming a civil servant or diplomat in India requires passing rigorous exams. Behind-the-scenes roles such as campaign managers, political strategists, analysts, and policy analysts are also expanding. Building a successful political career requires proactive engagement and practical experience. Internships, volunteer work, and grassroots involvement offer valuable opportunities to understand community needs, develop leadership skills, and build networks. Exposure to diverse perspectives and constructive dialogue fosters empathy and resilience, all of which are crucial for effective leadership. Educational institutions are pivotal in preparing aspiring leaders for the complexities of political leadership. Universities and training programmes provide academic rigour, mentorship, and experiential learning, bridging theory and practice. Partnerships with legislative bodies, government agencies, think-tanks, and non-profits offer practical exposure to policy-making, governance challenges, and real-world issues. As society evolves, so do the challenges and opportunities for political leaders. Technology and social media have transformed political communication and engagement, creating new avenues for citizen participation and accountability. Emerging fields such as digital governance, environmental policy, and inclusive development offer exciting opportunities for innovative leadership and cross-sector collaboration. Careers in political leadership and government offer unique opportunities to impact society meaningfully and shape the nation\u2019s future. Aspiring leaders should pursue interdisciplinary education, develop essential skills, and gain practical experience to prepare for upcoming challenges and responsibilities. By fostering a culture of integrity, empathy, and innovation, we can cultivate a new generation of ethical and visionary leaders committed to building a brighter, more inclusive future for all.

Mr. Modi alleged that the most dishonest and highly corrupt party and family in this country is the Congress. \u201cThe one most corrupt family and party in this country is the Congress. All streams of corruption originate from there and these JMM people also take training from the same school called Congress School of Corruption,\u201d Mr. Modi said. He also raised the issue of Bangladeshi infiltrators in Santhal Pargana alleging JMM standing with Bangladeshi and Rohingya infiltrators. \u201cInfiltration is the biggest issue in Jharkhand, recently Jharkhand High Court gave order for probe on infiltration but JMM government is not ready to accept that there is infiltration. Santhal Pargana and Kohlan region is affected with Bangladeshi Rohingiya Demographic is changing rapidly in the region. Tribal population is decreasing in Santhal Pargana, lands are being grabbed, infiltrators capturing land and atrocities on daughters have increased. People are feeling insecure,\u201d Mr. Modi said. He further said, \u201cThese infiltrators and fundamentalists are taking over JMM as well. Their people have even entered the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Do you know why this happened? Because the ghost of Congress has entered into JMM. When the ghost of Congress enters into any party, appeasement becomes the only agenda of that party,\u201d Mr. Modi said. He urged the gathering not to give vote to JMM and Congress in the coming assembly election. Mr. Modi claimed that JMM made their politics shine with the votes of the tribals and today standing with those who have occupied the forest land of the tribals. He also used the opportunity to attack the Jharkhand Chief Minister over the issue of Champai Soren who has recently joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after quitting JMM. \u201cWe have seen how Champai Soren was humiliated and removed from the post of the Chief Minister. Is Champai Soren not a tribe? Even Sita Soren was humiliated by her family,\u201d Mr. Modi said.

Attacking the State government over the death of excise constable candidates, Mr. Modi said that it was very unfortunate that due to poor management of the state government 15 youths died. He promised when BJP will form the government in Jharkhand, this matter would be investigated thoroughly. He accused that the only work JMM has done in the last five years is looting the state and even land of the army. Taking a dig at the Congress party, Mr. Modi said that these people are responsible for looting the treasury of the country and Jharkhand. With the visit of Mr. Modi, the BJP is trying their best to bounce back in the Kolhan region where there are 14 assembly seats out of which 9 is reserved for Scheduled Tribe (ST) and 1 for Scheduled Caste (SC), the remaining four seats are general seats. In the 2019 Assembly elections, BJP did not get a single seat in Kolhan. Most of the seats here are occupied by JMM and Congress. Champai Soren is also known as the Kolhan Tiger. Earlier in the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually flagged off six Vande Bharat trains and laid the foundation stone of several other railway projects of \u20b9650 crore apart from distributing sanction letters to 20,000 Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) beneficiaries from Ranchi. Though the programme was organised at Tatanagar railway station but due to heavy rain his chopper could not take off due to poor visibility and inclement weather condition. Even his road show in Jamshedpur was cancelled due to heavy rain and continuous rainfall. Later Mr. Modi went to Jamshedpur by road.

New Delhi: In an exciting development for fans, Diljit Dosanjh and Alia Bhatt are reuniting almost after eight years for a new track titled 'Chal Kudiye,' set to feature in Alia's forthcoming film, 'Jigra'. This collaboration follows their successful partnership on the hit song 'Ikk Kudi' from the 2016 film 'Udta Punjab', which remains a fan favourite. The teaser for 'Chal Kudiye' was shared by Alia Bhatt on Instagram, creating a buzz among her followers. The snippet opens with Alia, dressed in a t-shirt marked with the word 'Ghar' (Home), facing away from the camera. A post shared by Alia Bhatt (@aliaabhatt) Diljit Dosanjh makes a striking appearance in an all-white ensemble. Prominently displayed in the background is the film's title, 'Jigra.' Alia captioned the teaser, \"It's yours soon #ChalKudiye @diljitdosanjh #Jigra in cinemas 11th October.\" Fans were quick to express their enthusiasm in the comments section. One user remarked, \"My two most favourite people in one frame,\" while another predicted, \"A chartbuster loading. Can't wait for it .\" A third fan described it as, \"Once again a lethal combination.\" Earlier, Alia shared a behind-the-scenes photo from the set, highlighting a playful exchange between the two stars. The image featured Alia seated in a chair labelled 'The said Kudi,' while Dosanjh's chair read 'Sings about Kudi.' She captioned the photo, \"Chairs say it all.\" A post shared by Alia Bhatt (@aliaabhatt) The track 'Chal Kudiye' marks a reunion between Alia Bhatt and Dosanjh, who last collaborated on 'Udta Punjab' in 2016. The film, directed by Abhishek Chaubey, was a major success and featured Dosanjh's Hindi film debut alongside Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor, and Shahid Kapoor. Their rendition of 'Ikk Kudi' was particularly well-received. Meanwhile, 'Jigra', directed by Vasan Bala, is set for release on October 11, 2024. The recently unveiled teaser trailer showcases Alia Bhatt in a dramatic role as she navigates personal and familial challenges. The trailer features scenes of Alia's character grappling with time constraints and attempting to free Vedang Raina's character from arrest. The teaser also highlights a sibling bond and includes a modern rendition of the classic song 'Phoolon Ka Taaron Ka.' In addition to 'Jigra', Alia has several other high-profile projects lined up. She will star in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's historical drama 'Love and War', alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Vicky Kaushal. Alia Bhatt is also set to appear in 'Alpha', directed by Shiv Rawail, which promises to bring a fresh perspective to action films with its strong female lead. The film will also star Sharvari.",

            "content": "Boost your weight the healthy way! Discover tips and delicious recipes for nutritious meal planning aimed at healthy weight gain. Gaining weight in a healthy manner requires more than just eating extra calories; it's about incorporating nutrient-dense foods into your diet that support muscle growth, energy levels, and overall well-being. Whether you're aiming to build muscle, recover from an illness, or simply increase your body mass, the key to healthy weight gain lies in mindful meal planning. Here are tips and recipes to help you achieve your goals. Tips for Healthy Weight Gain: 1. Increase Caloric Intake with Nutrient-Dense Foods To gain weight, consume more calories than you burn. Focus on whole foods rich in nutrients like healthy fats, complex carbs, and lean protein. Avoid empty calories from junk food, which may add weight but won\u2019t contribute to muscle gain or overall health. 2. Eat Frequently Instead of three large meals, try to eat five to six smaller meals throughout the day. This helps to ensure a steady intake of calories and nutrients, making it easier to consume more food without feeling too full. 3. Prioritize Protein for Muscle Growth Protein is essential for building muscle mass. Include protein-rich foods in every meal, such as eggs, chicken, fish, tofu, beans, and dairy. Aim for at least 0.7 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight daily. 4. Include Healthy Fats Fats are an excellent source of concentrated calories and should be included in your meal plan. Opt for healthy fats from sources like avocados, olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish. These fats are also beneficial for heart health. 5. Incorporate Calorie-Rich Smoothies Smoothies are a great way to pack in extra calories without feeling overly full. Blend ingredients like milk, yogurt, nut butters, fruits, and protein powder to create delicious and nutritious smoothies that promote weight gain. 6. Don\u2019t Forget About Carbs Complex carbohydrates provide energy and should be a significant part of your weight-gain diet. Include foods like sweet potatoes, whole grains, quinoa, and brown rice in your meals to fuel your body and promote weight gain. 7. Hydrate but Avoid Drinking Water Before Meals Drink water throughout the day to stay hydrated but avoid drinking large amounts before meals as this can reduce your appetite. Choose calorie-dense beverages like milk or juice between meals to add extra calories. Have a look at this sample meal plan for healthy weight gain: Sample Meal Plan for Healthy Weight Gain Breakfast: Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie - 1 banana - 2 tbsp peanut butter - 1 cup whole milk - 1\u20442 cup Greek yogurt - 1 tbsp honey - 1 scoop of protein powder Blend all ingredients together for a high-calorie, protein-packed smoothie to start your day. Mid-Morning Snack: Greek Yogurt with Nuts and Berries - 1 cup Greek yogurt - A handful of mixed nuts (almonds, walnuts) - A handful of fresh berries (blueberries, strawberries) Top your yogurt with nuts and berries for a healthy, energy-boosting snack. Lunch: Grilled Chicken with Quinoa and Avocado - 4 oz grilled chicken breast - 1 cup cooked quinoa - 1\u20442 avocado - Drizzle of olive oil Combine the ingredients for a balanced meal rich in protein, healthy fats, and carbs. Afternoon Snack: Trail Mix and a Protein Shake - 1 handful of mixed dried fruit and nuts - 1 protein shake made with milk, protein powder, and a handful of spinach Dinner: Salmon with Sweet Potatoes and Vegetables - 5 oz baked salmon - 1 medium sweet potato, roasted - Steamed broccoli and carrots Drizzle olive oil on the vegetables and sweet potatoes for healthy fats. Evening Snack: Cottage Cheese with Honey and Almonds - 1 cup cottage cheese - 1 tbsp honey - A handful of almonds This snack is rich in protein and healthy fats, ideal before bed to promote muscle recovery. Healthy weight gain is all about balance and consistency. By incorporating nutrient-dense foods and following a structured meal plan, you can achieve your weight-gain goals while ensuring your body gets the essential nutrients it needs. Make sure to focus on whole foods, frequent meals, and incorporating a variety of macronutrients like protein, fats, and carbohydrates to promote muscle growth and maintain energy levels.

            "content": "Jordan's Prime Minister Bisher Khasawneh submitted his resignation on Sunday, officials familiar with the matter said, less than a week after a parliamentary election that saw some gains for the Islamist opposition in the US-allied kingdom. US-educated Jaafar Hassan, now head of King Abdullah's office and a former planning minister, is expected to replace Khasawneh, a veteran diplomat and former palace advisor who was appointed nearly four years ago, the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Hassan will face the challenges of mitigating the impact of the Gaza war on the kingdom's economy, hard hit by curbs on investment and a sharp drop in tourism. The outgoing prime minister had sought to push reforms pushed by King Abdullah to help reverse a decade of sluggish growth hovering at around 2 per cent that was worsened by the pandemic and conflict in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. The Muslim Brotherhood opposition and ideological allies of the Palestinian militant group Hamas made significant gains in Tuesday's election, boosted by anger over Israel's war in Gaza. The new composition of the 138-member parliament retains a pro-government majority, but a more vocal Islamist-led opposition could challenge IMF-led free-market reforms and foreign policy. This is a breaking story. More details will be added. (With inputs from agency)",

Suresh on Sunday (September 15, 2024) denied that the arrest was a result of hate politics. \u201cNone of us had tutored Mr. Muniratna to use abusive language and seek commission. No one can tolerate the language used by women. We cannot tolerate statements that incite violence between castes and look down upon communities,\u201d Mr. Suresh told reporters in Bengaluru. \u201cThough the incident is like an open book, some Opposition leaders are trying to give a political colour to the incident,\u201d he added. Responding to the statement of Leader of Opposition R. Ashok, who accused that the former Minister has been arrested to take political revenge, Mr. Suresh said: \u201cWhat is the relationship between politics and hate? No one had asked him to abuse. We got to know about the incident only after the complaint was filed. Police have now arrested Mr. Muniratna and rest of the details will be known after investigation.\u201d When his response was sought to the accusation by Mr. Muniratna that Mr. Suresh was behind his arrest, the former MP from Bengaluru Rural and brother of Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar said, \u201cAs you have seen, I am not taking part in anything. I do not even know the issue, and I do not even want to know. I have respected the decision of the people (voter), and I am helping people in whatever I can. I have kept away from political leaders.

            "content": "Following Arvind Kejriwal's announcement to submit his resignation in two days, Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav has raised questions about the reasoning behind the two-day timeline. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s announcement to step down as Delhi Chief Minister in two days has sparked quick reactions from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with party leaders labeling the move as a 'PR stunt.' \u201cSonia Gandhi Model\u201d BJP national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari has asserted that Arvind Kejriwal is aware that his public image in Delhi no longer reflects that of an honest leader. \u201cThis is a PR stunt of Arvind Kejriwal. He has understood that his image among the people of Delhi is not of an honest leader but of a corrupt leader, today Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is known across the country as a corrupt party,\u201d ANI quoted Bhandari. Accusing AAP of applying the Sonia Gandhi model, he added, \u201cHe wants to restore his image...It is clear that he wants to apply the Sonia Gandhi model, where she made Manmohan Singh a dummy Prime Minister and ran the government from behind the scenes...They want to make someone else a scapegoat.\" \u201cCompelled By Supreme Court Ruling\u201d BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa stated that Arvind Kejriwal has no choice but to resign due to the bail conditions imposed on him by the Supreme Court. \u201cArvind Kejriwal has declared that he will step down in two days, with plans to return as Chief Minister once he receives a mandate from the people. This is not a sacrifice; the Supreme Court\u2019s order explicitly bars him from approaching the CM\u2019s office or signing any official documents. Therefore, you have no choice\u2014your resignation is compelled by the SC's ruling. The people already delivered their verdict three months ago when you posed the question, \u2018jail or bail.\u2019 You lost all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi and were subsequently jailed.\u201d Sirsa told ANI. \u201cWhy To Wait Two days?\u201d Following Arvind Kejriwal's announcement to submit his resignation in two days, Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav has raised questions about the reasoning behind the two-day timeline. Yadav said, \"Why is he waiting for two days?... If Arvind Kejriwal had tendered his resignation six months ago, the public of Delhi would not have gone through a lot of crisis...This looks like a political drama as the Supreme Court has already imposed restrictions on him...A new Chief Minister should be appointed as soon as possible. The public of Delhi is aware and they will surely give an answer in the Delhi assembly elections,\" reported ANI. Kejriwal\u2019s Sudden Resignation Announcement In a significant development, Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal announced on Sunday that he will resign from his post in two days, vowing not to return to the Chief Minister's chair until the people of Delhi affirm his integrity. Arvind Kejriwal was released from Tihar Jail on Friday evening, following the Supreme Court's decision to grant him bail in connection with a corruption case linked to the alleged Delhi Excise Policy scam.",

Sheikh Hasina faces 33 cases, including murder, after ouster from Bangladesh The case was filed on Friday by 22-year-old Fahim Faisal, who claimed he was shot and injured during an anti-government protest in Dinajpur on August 4, a day before the fall of the Sheikh Hasina -led Awami League government, The Daily Star newspaper reported. \u201cWith this, the tally of cases against Ms. Hasina has reached 155, including 136 for murder, seven for crimes against humanity and genocide, three for abduction, eight for attempted murder and one for the attack on a Bangladesh Nationalist Party procession,\u201d the report said. According to the case statement, protesters were assaulted with firearms and local weapons, resulting in multiple injuries to Faisal, who was treated at Dinajpur Medical College Hospital and recovered partially. A month since Sheikh Hasina was forced out, Dhaka\u2019s new rulers ask for \u2018patience\u2019 The case accuses 59 people, including Ms. Hasina, former whip Iqbalur Rahim and Dinajpur Sadar Upazila Chairman Imdad Sarkar.

He was detained from Nangli, Kolar district, on Sunday evening (September 15, 2024), when he was reportedly fleeing and was on the way to Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh. He was produced before judge Santosh Gajanana Bhat of the Special Court exclusively to deal with criminal cases related to elected former and sitting MLAs and MPs at his residence in the wee hours of Sunday (September 15, 2024). The Judge remanded him into two days of police custody. The city police have recorded voice samples of the arrested MLA and sent them to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Madiwala. An audio recording of a conversation between the complainant contractor Cheluvaraju and MLA Munirathna, is the key evidence in the case. In the audio clip, the man purported to be MLA Munirathna is heard hurling casteist abuses against a Scheduled Caste community and danding a bribe, threatening the contractor. The audio clip has already been sent for FSL, Madiwala. The voice in the audio clip will be matched with voice samples collected from MLA Munirathna. Denying allegations against him, Mr. Munirathna has said that the voice in the audio clip is not his, and he would resign as an MLA if the voice was proved to be his.

The Falcons haven't been at their best and have already lost five matches in the competition. Brandon King has returned from his injury, however, the Falcons are missing that middle and lower-order push in the death overs with the bat and hence, have lacked those 15-20 runs in probably every single game. In the two games they won, their bowlers were able to restrict the opposition, otherwise, it has just been the same story for the Chris Green side. The Kings got their top-order firing in the last game and would want to build on the same as the bowling apart from Noor Ahmad still remains a concern. However, if ever a fixture the Kings would have wanted after their last win would be this, an underconfident side on the verge of elimination and would hope to begin a winning streak on the way to the playoffs. , Brandon King, Justin Greaves, Sam Billings, Tim Seifert, Roston Chase (vc), Noor Ahmad (c), , Matthew Forde, Jewel Andrew, Imad Wasim Johnson Charles, Faf du Plessis(c), Tim Seifert(w), Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Ackeem Auguste, Sadrack Descarte, Roston Chase, David Wiese, Matthew Forde, Alzarri Joseph, Noor Ahmad Brandon King, Justin Greaves, Sam Billings(w), Fabian Allen, Chris Green(c), Roshon Primus, Shamar Springer, Kofi James, Jewel Andrew, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Amir",

            "content": "AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal has played an \"emotional card\" by announcing that he would resign as Delhi Chief Minister after two days in his bid to make a virtue out of necessity, the BJP said on Sunday (September 15, 2024). \"He is enacting the resignation drama because the court did not acquit him in the (excise policy scam) case and instead granted him a conditional bail, which turned him into a ceremonial Minister from the Chief Minister,\" BJP national spokesperson Shezad Poonwalla claimed. Two days after being released from Tihar on bail in the excise policy scam case , the AAP national convener said he would resign after two days and would demand early polls in Delhi. He vowed not to sit in CM's chair till people give him a \"certificate of honesty\". Terming Mr. Kejriwal's move a \"PR exercise and a drama\", Mr. Poonwalla alleged that the AAP national convenor's announcement is a part of his plan to make his wife Sunita Kejriwal the Chief Minister. \"Arvind Kejriwal has done a PhD on how to make a virtue out of necessity.\" Addressing AAP workers, Mr. Kejriwal said he would hold a meeting of AAP MLAs in the next couple of days and a party leader would take over as chief minister. Hitting out at the Delhi Chief Minister, Mr. Poonwalla said, \"He has taken two days' time because his entire plan is to make his wife Sunita Kejriwal chief minister of Delhi in his place.\" \"The emotional and PR cards that he is playing is aimed at creating a Manmohan Singh-like system in Delhi as (former Congress president) Sonia Gandhi did,\" the BJP leader charged. In the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls , people ensured the defeat of the AAP and the Congress in all seven seats despite the Kejriwal-led party's 'jail ka badla vote campaign', he added.

            "content": "Couples are opting for sustainable eco-friendly weddings with de\u0301cor that is locally sourced, preferably made of natural or reusable material. A wedding celebration in India is not just about the wedding day but also about the intimate ceremonies that precede it like Mehendi, Sangeet, Cocktail, Haldi, Phera and Reception. It is the coming together of two families who are celebrating the union of their loved ones. While the couple holds the centre stage, it\u2019s the family that ensures that everybody is having a good time at their wedding. Destination Weddings have emerged as the perfect way to ensure that the wedding is celebrated in style, even as the wedding planner ensures a smooth flow, leading to a stress-free celebration for the family. Here are the destination wedding trends for 2024 shared by Vaibhav Sadhwani, Co-founder, Behind The Scene \u2013 Destination Wedding Consultants that are making the occasion a memorable affair for the couple as well as the guests. Love for Sustainability and Environment What\u2019s In: Couples are opting for sustainable eco-friendly weddings with de\u0301cor that is locally sourced, preferably made of natural or reusable material. Blending with natural surroundings, the de\u0301cor is being kept to minimum in most instances. The focus is also on locally sourced food and local cuisine. Minimising food waste is a top priority while some are even opting for banana leaves to serve food instead of the more prevalent one-time-use cutlery. Solar-powered venues are also being preferred by wedding parties. What\u2019s out: Extravagant de\u0301cor, transported from different places leading to increased footprint is being cut down Intimate & Personal Celebrations What\u2019s in: Small weddings are the flavour of the year as they provide great experience. But such intimate weddings need a deep understanding of the guests and accommodating to their needs. While private tours are arranged for guests on days there aren\u2019t any rituals, gourmet tastings and local experiences are also preferred. A welcome bag containing goodies, some munchies and useful things is always appreciated by guests. Subtlety and customization is the key here. It is essential to note that intimate and personal celebrations mean an eye for detail and making each guest comfortable and happy. What\u2019s Out: The same size fits all kind of packages are not popular anymore as hosts are often very careful about the experiences being rolled out for the guests. Extended Celebrations What\u2019s In: A wedding is usually a 2-3 days event with rituals panning over these days, leading to the wedding day. A welcome party and group excursion to explore the destination is also being included. So, couples prefer to have all the rituals at the destination making it a celebration where guests can soak in on the beauty of the destination. What\u2019s Out: There was a time when people performed the rituals at home and flew in just for the wedding day, but it ended up creating more chaos. Thus fly in destination weddings are out, as people now prefer extended celebrations. Integrating Technology What\u2019s In: As in all other realms of life, weddings are also not untouched by technology. The virtual guest books ensures that their travel and other needs are being co-ordinated, LIVE transmission is also done for guests who could not attend the wedding. VR is also seen at weddings whereas 360 degree photography gives a completely new perspective to the weddings. What\u2019s Out: Traditional wedding photography and videography is out as couples are opting for smartly shot reels and photographs that highlight them as a couple. Destinations Beyond Ordinary What\u2019s In : Couples are opting for remote locations with the thrill of wilderness or hills and of course the royal wedding in Rajasthan can never be out of fashion. Choosing offbeat destinations, couples are getting married at places that resonate more with their own vibe. And in sync with that, rigid customs are giving way to more flexible options so that guests and couple can enjoy the destination as well as the wedding. What\u2019s Out: While earlier there was widespread preference for banquets or venues in or on the outskirts of major metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai etc, couples are now more willing to go for remote locations that ensure a more authentic destination wedding kind of feel. Blending Cultures What\u2019s In: Local flavours are the highlights for the couple opting for destination wedding. Thus, they opt for local cuisine, local de\u0301cor and even local folk artists. A wedding in Rajasthan is replete with traditional food, henna artists and folk dancers and singers entertaining the guests. On the other hand, a wedding in Goa will be more laidback with beach settings, and wine and cheese tastings. Often times these weddings are a fusion, imbibing customs of both sides plus with the local flavour making it a unique wedding. What\u2019s Out: Flying in everything from de\u0301cor to artists is not something that people are willing to spend much on. While it is expensive and kills the whole purpose of a destination wedding, it is just contrary to the whole concept of intimate weddings, which is indeed quite a personal affair!",

The six-time MLA's remarks come at a time when the party has already made it clear that Nayab Singh Saini will be the chief minister if the BJP returns to power. Saini is also the party's chief ministerial face in the polls. \"I never sought anything from the party till today. People from Haryana are coming to meet me. Even in Ambala, people tell me that I am senior-most why I did not become CM. On demand of the people, and on the basis of seniority, this time I will stake claim to become chief minister,\" Vij said. Whether the party makes me or not, it is up to them. But if they make me CM, I will change Haryana's 'takdeer and tasveer' (face and destiny of Haryana), the Ambala Cantt MLA said. When asked to clarify the remarks he made while interacting with reporters in Ambala, Vij later told media, \"I am the party's senior-most MLA and have won six elections and am contesting my seventh one. I have never sought anything from my party so far. \"But people from across Haryana and people of my own constituency have been meeting me. I will stake claim for the chief minister's post,\" the 71-year-old Vij said. \"It is up to the party high command to take a call,\" he said. When pointed out the Saini has already been declared chief ministerial candidate, Vij said, \"There is no bar on staking the claim. I will make my claim, let the party take a call\". Asked about the timing of his decision with polls only a couple of weeks away, Vij said he took the decision after people came to meet him. Notably, in March, Manohar Lal Khattar was replaced by Saini as chief minister.",

Shivalinga Nayak (24), a sales executive in a motor vehicle company, was detained by the police. \u201cThe youth, a fan of Mr. Siddaramaiah, wanted to put a shawl on the Chief Minister,\u201d sources said. He tried to breach the security ring and get on to the stage to meet and facilitate the Chief Minister when Social Welfare Minister Dr. H. C. Mahadevappa was talking. Alert security personnel pinned him down and bundled him to the nearest police station, where he was detained for questioning. The police found no incriminating material on him and are questioning him further and ascertaining his background to ascertain the facts. A senior police officer said the incident exposes the chinks in the security cordon around the Chief Minister and it would be reviewed soon.

The RJD still takes revenge for the formation of Jharkhand even today. Congress hates Jharkhand. JMM standing with Bangladeshi infiltrators, Rohingyas. These infiltrators and extremists are taking JMM under their control and have entered the JMM. This happened because the ghost of Congress has entered JMM. These parties want to create their vote banks in the name of religion,\u201d PM Modi said at a rally. \"Currently, infiltration is the biggest problem of Jharkhand. The parents of young daughters are worried. 2-3 days ago, Jharkhand High Court ordered an independent panel to investigate the infiltration... But the JMM government is not ready to admit that there is infiltration in Jharkhand... Bangladeshi and Rohingya infiltration is a huge problem in Santhal Pargana and Kolhan. The demography of the whole region is changing rapidly,\" he added. \u201cWas Champai Soren not an Aadivasi? Didn't he belong to a poor family? But he was insulted and removed from the chief minister's post to grab the CM chair. People of Jharkhand will answer this,\u201d the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister also lashed out at the Congress and said that it runs a \u201cschool of corruption\u201d. \u201cThere is only one most corrupt party -- Congress. The most corrupt family is the Congress' family. All streams of corruption come from Congress. JMM is also taking training from the same school. The name of the school is 'Congress school of corruption'. JMM has only looted Jharkhand in the last five years,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "On Sunday (September 15, 2024), Keralites gathered at homes to celebrate Onam, a largely secular festival reminiscent of a utopian pastoral past, with gifts, group games, new clothes, floral decorations, fireworks, house visits and a lavish traditional spread served on emerald green banana leaves. The palpable festival cheer and bonhomie also spilt onto the street from homes. Clubs and resident associations set up swings, revived conventional games and organised feats of strength competitions, including arm wrestling, pole climbing, and log pillow fights. Onam also saw a revival of harvest season games played on fallow fields in the past, including Ola Panthu, Kuttiyum Kolum and Uri Adi. Kanakakunnu Palace In Thiruvananthapuram, the historic Kanakakunnu Palace and its sprawling, leafy grounds emerged as the epicentre of flashy and modern Onam celebrations, marked by music concerts, dances, light and sound shows and folk art performances. The nearby Manaveeyam Veedhi provided a stage for young artists to showcase their talent. Blues of Wayanad landslide erased The festival seemed to erase, at least temporarily, the blues of the Wayanad landslide disaster that shocked Kerala in July. The State Government had cancelled official celebrations in mourning for the lost lives. However, it allowed businesses and media houses, including TV channels, to organise events. A founding fable Onam, founded on the fable of the return of a beloved fairy tale king banished by jealous Gods to the netherworld, has evolved over the years into a secular national festival and cultural holiday for Keralites. Diaspora Onam The festival has also helped the sizeable Malayalee diaspora establish their cultural identity in foreign lands. Conventional and social media were replete with Onam celebrations of settler Malayalees in the Gulf, the U.S., England and Europe. Organised under the auspices of the Malayalee Associations, the expatriates used the occasion to showcase their linguistic, culinary and societal uniqueness to the world. Devotees throng Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple Closer home, members of the erstwhile ruling family of Travancore lit a lamp beside the mammoth floral motif marking Onam in front of the iconic Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple. The temple thronged with devotees in the morning. Traditional feast for devotees in Aranmula Temple The historic Aranmula Parthasarathy temple in Pathanamthitta district welcomed Onam with a traditional feast for devotees. Hundreds of people made a beeline for the Vamana temple at Thrikkakara in Ernakulam district. The temple has a special place in Onam lore. Legend has it that its presiding deity, an incarnation of Vishnu, had despatched Mahabali to the underworld at the behest of other gods envious of the mythical king\u2019s fair rein and bonding with his subjects. Philanthropy Acts of philanthropy also marked Onam. Voluntary organisations served Onam sadya to patients and bystanders in hospital wards, orphanages and State-run geriatric homes. The Onam spirit seemed all pervasive. For one, it also penetrated the forbidding walls of the Central Prison in Thiruvananthapuram. Central Prison celebrates Onam Established by the colonial government in 1886, the sprawling Central Prison, spread across 64 acres of verdant land, organised games and cultural programmes in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram and served the traditional Onam feast for nearly 1,600 inmates. Law enforcers in Thiruvananthapuram also took a small break from work and enjoyed Onam feasts in State Houses. Heavy advertisement-backed television programmes showed commercialised glitter of the high-decibel holiday. Made-for-television festival It was also a made-for-television Onam, with content creators hiring top entertainment talent, including movie stars and celebrities, to keep families glued to the screen. President and PM greet Keralites President of India Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeted Keralites on Onam. Ms. Murmu posted on X: On the auspicious occasion of Onam, I convey my heartiest greetings to everyone, particularly to our brothers and sisters in Kerala. During this festival, we celebrate the new harvest and show our gratitude to mother nature. May this festival bring peace, prosperity and happiness\u201d Mr. Modi also took to social media to greet Keralites. He posted on X: \u201dWishing everyone a joyous Onam. May there be peace, prosperity and wellness all over. This festival celebrates the glorious culture of Kerala and is marked enthusiastically by the Malayali community all over the world\u201d. Kerala Governor Arif Muhammad Khan, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Leader of the Opposition V. D. Satheesan also greeted the people.

            "content": "According to the weekly RBI data, foreign currency assets (FCAs) grew by $5.10 billion to $604.1 billion. New Delhi: Despite global economic headwinds and deepening geopolitical uncertainties, the forex reserves are at record all-time high levels and are set to cross $700 billion in FY25 sooner than expected. According to the latest note by global investment firm Jefferies, RBI's forex reserve is estimated to go up by a massive $53 billion to reach $700 billion in the current fiscal (FY25E). The rupee is now the most stable currency among major economies, it added. However, the way forex reserves are surging in FY25, the $700 billion mark does not look very far. India's forex reserves jumped $5.2 billion to a fresh all-time high of $689.24 billion (in the week ended September 6). According to the weekly RBI data, foreign currency assets (FCAs) grew by $5.10 billion to $604.1 billion. The country is currently seeing strong domestic flows. FPI flows into debt markets have also picked up. FPIs bought equities in the Indian stock market worth Rs 16,800 crore last week, taking the total buying to Rs 27,856 crore (till September 13). As per the NSDL data, FPIs were buyers of equity in the cash market on all days last week. In 2024, the total investments by FPIs now stand at Rs 70,737 crore to date. According to market watchers, positive FPI flows have helped in achieving record forex levels in the country. This is set to create external sector resilience and boost the economy across sectors. The substantial foreign exchange reserves will provide the RBI with greater flexibility in monetary policy and currency management. India's reserve position with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has gone up $9 million to $4.631 billion. According to market experts, India's strong forex will boost its economic growth trajectory by strengthening its position internationally, drawing in foreign investments, and promoting domestic trade and industry. Meanwhile, with the inflation in the second quarter of FY25 likely to remain below the RBI forecast of 4.4 per cent, amid the cooling of food prices, the central bank may consider rate cuts in the forthcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings. According to Jefferies, interest rates across the world have seen a sharp jump and a cycle reversal seems likely in the coming quarters which would create headroom for the RBI to also taper down benchmark interest rates in India.",

            "content": "Currently, the total installed capacity of solar photovoltaic (PV) power in the country stands at 85.47 gigawatts (GW) and wind power at 46.65 GW. New Delhi: As the world's largest democracy and a rapidly developing nation, India's renewable energy journey will serve as a model for other emerging economies navigating the path to sustainability, Pralhad Joshi, Union Minister of New and Renewable Energy, has said. The country aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, focusing on renewable energy expansion, and plans to reach 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030. According to the minister, the country\u2019s renewable energy journey is supported by strong policy backing and international partnership. For example, initiatives like the International Solar Alliance (ISA), cofounded by India and France, seek to promote solar energy use worldwide, particularly in developing countries. \u201cDespite having one of the lowest per capita emissions in the world, India is not only championing the cause of clean energy under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but also inspiring other nations to join the cause,\u201d Joshi said. PM Modi said last month that India is the only G20 country to have ensured that the pledge towards creating a green planet made at the Paris Climate Change Summit in 2015 was fulfilled even before the deadline. The country has now updated its targets to reduce emissions intensity of its GDP to 45 per cent by 2030 from the 2005 level, and cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources to 50 per cent by 2030. Currently, the total installed capacity of solar photovoltaic (PV) power in the country stands at 85.47 gigawatts (GW) and wind power at 46.65 GW. The Centre has undertaken several measures and initiatives to promote the development of renewable energy (RE), including solar and wind power. As the country aims to achieve 500 GW of installed electric capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030. the government has permitted Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 100 per cent under the automatic route. According to the Economic Survey, the country has a well-established infrastructure to attract FDI in sectors like greenfield projects such as renewables.",

Now it's in the hands of the people of Delhi to decide if he is honest or not. Arvind Kejriwal had asked for votes in the name of work in 2020 and said that if I have worked, then vote for me, if I have not worked then do not vote for me. The people of Delhi will declare the Chief Minister honest by voting for AAP and in the upcoming 2025 Delhi elections, the people of Delhi will declare their Chief Minister honest through that election,\" Chadha told media. Meanwhile, Delhi Minister Kailash Gahlot said that the Delhi CM has left it to the people of Delhi to decide whether he is honest and the party is honest or not. \"We agree with the Chief Minister. Arvind Kejriwal has earned people's love, respect and blessings. He has left it to the people of Delhi to decide whether he is honest and the party is honest or not. No talks of dissolving the Assembly have been done so far,\" Gahlot said. AAP MP Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said, \"Just to keep him jailed, he was arrested by the CBI when he got a bail from the ED. The SC also said that the CBI has become a caged parrot. A decision to quit the CM chair until the people give their verdict, such a decision can only be taken by an honest person. Only Arvind Kejriwal can leave the CM chair after coming out of jail.\" Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit reacted to the Delhi CM's resignation and dubbed it a gimmick, adding that this had happened for the first time when an elected leader came out of jail on bail and was asked by the SC to not go to the CMO or sign any papers. \"There is no question of becoming the CM again. We have been saying this for a long time that he should resign as the CM. This is a mere gimmick. This happened for the first time when an elected leader came out of jail on bail, and was asked by the SC to not go to the CMO or sign any papers. Such conditions were never imposed on any other CM. Maybe even the SC fears that this person might try to tamper with the evidence. The SC is treating him like a criminal. There is no correlation of morality and Arvind Kejriwal,\" Dikshit told media. Earlier today, Arvind Kejriwal said that he will resign from the position of Chief Minister after two days and won't sit on the chair of CM, until the public of Delhi declares him \"honest.\" Kejriwal further said that if the public votes for him, it will give him a certificate for his honesty. He also said he would ask for early polls along with the state of Maharashtra. \"I am going to resign from the CM position after two days. I will not sit on the CM chair until the people give their verdict. I will go to every house and street and not sit on the CM chair till I get a verdict from the people. I will not sit on the CM post until the public announces its decision. Elections are after a few months. If you think Kejriwal is honest, then vote for me, I will take over as CM after the elections. If you think I am not, don't vote. Your vote will be a certificate for my honesty, then only I will sit on the post of CM,\" Kejriwal said.\" The elections are supposed to be held in February. I demand elections be held in November with Maharashtra elections. Till elections are held, someone else from the party will be the Chief Minister. In the next 2-3 days, a meeting of the MLAs will be held, where the next CM will be decided,\" he added. Assembly polls in Delhi are expected to be held in early 2025. Congress could not win a single seat in the Delhi assembly polls held in 2020. While AAP won 62 out of the 70 seats, BJP secured eighth seats in the last assembly polls.",

            "content": "The six-time MLA's remarks come at a time when the party has already made it clear that Nayab Singh Saini will be the chief minister if the BJP returns to power. Chandigarh: Senior BJP leader and former Minister Anil Vij on Sunday said he will stake claim for the chief minister's post if the party returns to power in Haryana after the October 5 Assembly polls. The six-time MLA's remarks come at a time when the party has already made it clear that Nayab Singh Saini will be the chief minister if the BJP returns to power. Saini is also the party's chief ministerial face in the polls. \"I never sought anything from the party till today...people from Haryana are coming to meet me. Even in Ambala, people tell me that I am senior-most why I did not become CM. On demand of the people, and on the basis of seniority, this time I will stake claim to become chief minister,\" Vij said. Whether the party makes me or not, it is up to them. But if they make me CM, I will change Haryana's 'takdeer and tasveer' (face and destiny of Haryana), the Ambala Cantt MLA said. When asked to clarify the remarks he made while interacting with reporters in Ambala, Vij later told PTI over phone, \"I am the party's senior-most MLA and have won six elections and am contesting my seventh one. I have never sought anything from my party so far. \"But people from across Haryana and people of my own constituency have been meeting me... I will stake claim for the chief minister's post,\" the 71-year-old Vij said. \"It is up to the party high command to take a call,\" he said. When pointed out the Saini has already been declared chief ministerial candidate, Vij said, \"There is no bar on staking the claim. I will make my claim, let the party take a call\". Asked about the timing of his decision with polls only a couple of weeks away, Vij said he took the decision after people came to meet him. Notably, in March, Manohar Lal Khattar was replaced by Saini as chief minister. Polling for the 90 assembly seats in Haryana will be held on October 5 and the votes will be counted on October 8.",

            "content": "Prashant Kishor vowed on Saturday to end the liquor ban in Bihar immediately if elected to power. Patna: Ahead of his party's foundation day on October 2, Jan Suraj chief Prashant Kishor vowed on Saturday to end the liquor ban in Bihar immediately if elected to power. While speaking to ANI, Kishor said, \"There is no need for any special preparation for the 2nd. We have been preparing for the last two years... If the Jan Suraj government is formed, we will end the liquor ban within one hour.\" When asked about Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav's yatra, he remarked, \"My best wishes to him. At least he has come out of the house and is going among the public.\" Commenting on the ongoing war of words between the RJD and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, following Tejashwi Yadav's claim that Nitish Kumar had apologised with folded hands for joining the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Kishor said both leaders have harmed Bihar. \"This issue is between Nitish Kumar and Tejashwi Yadav, and it doesn't matter who apologised with folded hands to whom; both have caused damage to Bihar. The people of Bihar have witnessed both of them for 30 years. We are urging them both to leave Bihar,\" said Prashant Kishor. Earlier, Kishor launched a scathing attack on Bihar's Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, questioning his ability to lead the state's development. Addressing a gathering in Bhojpur, Bihar, Kishor said, \"If someone could not get educated due to a lack of resources, it is understandable. But if someone's parents were Chief Ministers and he couldn't pass the 10th class, it reflects their approach towards education.\" Criticising Tejashwi Yadav's educational background, Kishor highlighted the irony, saying, \"A 9th-class dropout is showing the way to Bihar's development. He (Tejashwi Yadav) doesn't know the difference between GDP and GDP growth, yet he claims to know how Bihar will improve.\" Kishor further questioned Tejashwi Yadav's credentials, pointing out that his only claim to leadership is being the son of former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Yadav and a leader in the RJD due to family ties. Kishor argued that Yadav needs to work hard and prove himself through his actions if he wants to build a reputation beyond being Lalu Yadav's son.",
