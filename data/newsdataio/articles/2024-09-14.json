His remarks came while addressing the Indian Community in Geneva on Friday (September 13). The EAM\u2019s statement had a reference to Rahul Gandhi\u2019s viral remark during the campaign for the Lok Sabha Elections earlier this year, in which he frequently used the word \u201ckhatakhat\u201d (in a flash) to state that money would be sent to women\u2019s accounts every month if the Opposition\u2019s INDIA bloc government is formed. His \u201ckhatakhat\u201d remark had also drawn a reaction from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",

The production by state-owned Coal India Ltd rose to 311 MT during the same period, marking a growth of 2.80 per cent compared to 302.53 MT in the corresponding period of the previous year.This growth is even more notable given the interruptions in mining activities in CIL subsidiaries due to heavy rains, it said.Coal dispatch has also experienced a substantial uplift, reaching 442.24 MT during 2024-25 (up to September 12), compared to 421.29 MT in the same period last year, it said, adding that this reflects a robust growth",

My gunman tried to get the traffic cleared and told the truck driver to move along one side of the road and also allow other vehicles to pass,\" Jangra said.\"However, the truck driver misbehaved with my gunman, who, however, did not want to escalate the matter",

FMCG and oil & gas sectors faced selling pressure, while realty, media, and PSU bank stocks gained ground. Global equity markets remained largely positive, buoyed by US macroeconomic data suggesting that inflation may be under control. However, weaker-than-expected US labor market data tempered some of this optimism. Domestic sentiment was supported by daily FII inflows and a decline in US 10-year Treasury yields.",

            "description": "The Indian rupee witnessed range-bound trade and settled for the day higher by 6 paise at 83.90 (provisional) against the US dollar on Friday supported by weakening of the American currency in the overseas market and significant foreign fund inflows. The dollar index fell below 101, extending losses from the previous session amid growing expectations that the Federal Reserve could act more aggressively when it starts cutting interest rates next week. Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P/BSE Sensex slid 71.77 points, or 0.09 percent, to 82,890.94 while the broader NSE Nifty index settled at 25,356.50, down 32.40 points, or 0.13 percent, from its previous close. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.92 and witnessed an intraday high of 83.85 and a low of 83.98 against the American currency.",

In the second video, Srinivasan was seen purportedly apologising in person to the Finance Minister.Gandhi said if this \"arrogant government\" would listen to the people they would understand that a simplified GST would solve the problems of lakhs of businesses.In a post on X, Gandhi said when the owner of a small business, like Annapoorna restaurant in Coimbatore, asks public servants for a simplified GST regime, his request is met",

The ruling came in response to petitions filed by Kejriwal challenging his arrest and seeking bail in the CBI case. This development comes amidst a series of legal challenges faced by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader. On Wednesday, a Delhi court extended Kejriwal's judicial custody until September 25th in connection with the liquor policy scam. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested Kejriwal on March 21st this year in a related money laundering case, and on June 26th, the CBI formally arrested him in the corruption case linked to the alleged scam.",

The current retirement age is 60 for men, and 50 for women in blue-collar jobs and 55 for women in white-collar jobs.The policy will be implemented starting in January next year, according to the announcement from China's legislature reported by state broadcaster CCTV.We have more people coming into the retirement age, and so the pension fund is (facing) high pressure, that's why I think it's now time to act seriously, said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Australia who studies China's population and its ties to the economy.The change will take effect",

Moreover, this court cannot grant any such declaration. Interlocutory application is dismissed,\" the bench ordered.During the hearing, the bench asked the counsel what advantage the city would get if it was declared a heritage city and what were the provisions under law to give such a declaration.The counsel said that Agra needed to be declared a heritage city as it has a history of over 1,000 years and several historic monuments which need to be preserved.\"Declaring Agra as a heritage city would give a boost to tourism",
