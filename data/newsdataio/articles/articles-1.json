            "description": "Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL) completes redemption of all outstanding $750 million 4.375 per cent Holdco Notes due on 8 September 2024. This follows AGEL's announcement, in January 2024, to fully backstop the Holdco Notes through a fully funded redemption reserve account maintained eight months prior to the redemption date to facilitate full redemption of Holdco Notes upon maturity in compliance with applicable guidelines.Issued in September 2021, the three-year Holdco Notes have supported AGEL\u2019s high-growth objectives. During the period, AGEL\u2019s capacity has increased more than threefold \u2014 from 3.5 GW to 11.2 GW, registering a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 48 per cent.AGEL's overall capital management philosophy has remained focused on long-term value creation through asset development and positioned AGEL as a self-propelled growth engine. It also emphasises the structured approach to accomplish credit metrics akin to investment grade profile for its underlying debt capital raise programme.With this, AGEL is committed to having capital market issuances tailored for long-term infra asset class supported through the predictable and robust cashflow stream to attain long curve emulating underlying asset life. Over the years, the Capital Management Plan has matured to allow AGEL to have a 'seasoned' portfolio with a superior operational asset base supporting the under-construction development. With surplus cash from operating assets augmenting the under-construction projects\u2019 requirement, AGEL\u2019s overall capex program remains fully funded with such operational assets cashflows and the available construction facility pool. In addition, AGEL\u2019s promoters had agreed, in December 2023, to subscribe to a preferential warrant amounting to Rs 9,350 crore, out of which, Rs 7,013 crore ($835 million equivalent) shall be available with AGEL to fund any accelerated capital expenditure requirements.AGEL thanks its investors and lenders for their confidence and its vendor partners, including Adani Infra (India) Ltd and Adani Infra Management Services Ltd, for their continuous support in achieving the accelerated growth plan, putting AGEL on track to achieve 50 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.",

            "description": "In an unprecedented move that melds the realms of law enforcement and extraterrestrial enigma, police chiefs from America\u2019s largest metropolises have unveiled a guide addressing Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs). This 11-page compendium, which emerged in June, serves as both a chilling chronicle and a practical manual for officers grappling with the specter of UFO encounters. According to DailyMail, the guide, meticulously crafted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA), cautions that unidentified flying objects \u201cpose significant safety risks to law enforcement air support units,\u201d advocating for heightened vigilance among helicopter crews. The document delves into nerve-wracking real-life incidents, underscoring the urgency for police departments to stay attuned to the unknown threats these aerial anomalies might represent. Among the harrowing narratives included, one from November 2023 stands out: a Blairsville, Georgia officer reported witnessing a \u201ctriangle craft with 3 dim green lights per side\u201d navigating the night sky. \u201cI am a police officer and deputy sheriff. While on duty after dark, near the top of my windshield (frame of view) I witnessed movement in the sky (southbound direction of view),\u201d the officer recounted. Despite his familiarity with conventional aerial traffic, he described the sighting as \u201cunlike anything I had ever witnessed.\u201d The guide\u2019s pages are also punctuated with accounts from other officers who have encountered UFOs while on patrol. In Harper Woods, Michigan, for instance, two officers observed three enigmatic objects in the sky that, as they described, \u201cblinked out\u201d of existence. Their account reads: \u201cAt approximately 6:00am, myself and a fellow officer were standing in a parking lot of a church talking before the end of our shift... The objects appeared to drift towards the east, maintaining the equal distance. As we watched the objects, they appeared to \u2018blink out\u2019 of our vision.\u201d The guide does not shy away from including high-profile testimonies and historical context. It features insights from notable figures such as former United States Air Force officer and intelligence official David Grusch, who in a 2023 congressional hearing, claimed knowledge of aircraft with \u201cnonhuman\u201d origins. Further enriching the guide are civilian reports documenting sightings of police helicopters seemingly pursuing UFOs. An Austin, Texas resident noted, \u201cWhen I walked out front door, saw Triangle Craft\u2014with white lights illuminated on each corner\u2014being closely followed by police helicopter.\u201d Similarly, a Winnipeg, Canada resident described witnessing a police chopper being overtaken by unidentified craft while relaxing in his hot tub. Nigel Watson, author of Captured by Aliens? A History and Analysis of American Abduction Claims, remarked on the guide's utility for law enforcement. He noted, \u201cThe short history of the study of UAPs and the links to organizations where sightings can be reported is very helpful.\u201d However, Watson also critiqued the guide for its reliance on testimonies from former government officials without substantial evidence, and for neglecting skeptical perspectives that could provide a more balanced view.",

Getting this job meant I could finally take a breath and be normal.But I felt anything but normal at Deloitte.",

            "description": "The Kerala government\u2019s decision to rent a helicopter for Rs 80 lakhs per month has come under scrutiny, as the intended purpose for its use has shifted significantly. Initially, the helicopter was rented for monitoring Maoist movements and conducting relief activities during disasters. However, it is now primarily being used for the chief minister\u2019s travels. While Kerala Thunderbolt soldiers continue to monitor Maoist activities on foot in the forest areas, the helicopter was notably absent during recent relief efforts following the devastating landslides in Wayanad. Instead, it was used solely for the chief minister\u2019s travel to address government officials, raising concerns about its cost-effectiveness and actual utility. The helicopter, rented by the Kerala government from Delhi-based Chipsan Aviation in September 2023, can be used for up to 25 hours per month at a cost of Rs 80 lakhs. For any additional flying hours beyond this limit, an extra charge of Rs 90,000 per hour is applicable. The Kerala government has incurred Rs 9.60 crore in helicopter rent so far, with the contract set for three years, projecting a total liability of Rs 28.80 crore. Critics argue that the state could have purchased its own helicopter for a much lower cost, estimated between Rs 5 crore and Rs 20 crore. The decision to rent a helicopter in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, sparked public outrage. That chopper, rented from Pawan Hans Company at a cost of Rs 22.21 crore, was considered unnecessary and largely unused, leading to the contract\u2019s termination after one year. Despite this, the government made the contentious decision to rent another helicopter in 2023. Allegations have surfaced that the government is funneling money to a private company under the guise of a helicopter rental contract. This luxury comes at a time when the state is grappling with severe financial crises. This publication has previously reported on the state\u2019s dire fiscal situation, where the government struggles to even secure loans to cover welfare pension payments for the elderly. Salaries and pensions for Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) employees remain uncertain, and there is a lack of funds for developmental projects and infrastructure improvements. The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation, established to offer essential goods at affordable prices, now sees few customers due to frequent shortages. New projects are stalled, and existing ones are barely progressing due to insufficient funds. Despite these financial woes, extravagances continue, with numerous high-paying appointments marred by widespread nepotism, leaving the public frustrated.",

            "description": "Introduces NovaplexTM MPXV/OPXV plus Assay (RUO) that is designed to detect Clade I, which has higher transmission and mortality rates than Clade II Adheres to the WHO issued target product profiles and provides accurate detection of viral strains Offers healthcare professionals with a critical tool in their research on the global spread of mpox by supporting international efforts SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Seegene Inc., a leading provider of total solution for PCR molecular diagnostics based in South Korea, announced today that it will introduce a new type of research-use-only (RUO) PCR assay to address the spread of the mpox virus variant, Clade Ib, which is currently prevalent in Africa. Seegene Expands mpox RUO Product Lineups: NovaplexTM MPXV/OPXV plus Assay (RUO) The newly introduced NovaplexTM MPXV/OPXV plus Assay (RUO) is designed to detect 3 targets causing mpox disease: non-variola Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) and mpox virus (MPVX) with specific confirmation of MPXV Clade I. MPXV Clade I is associated with higher transmission and mortality rates than MPXV Clade II. The assay meets the preferred target product profiles (TPPs) issued by the WHO, which guide manufacturers, suppliers, and researchers developing new assays for detection of viruses causing mpox. Additionally, it aligns with the preferred target analyte criteria for distinguishing between Clade I and II. Seegene has been responding swiftly to the August 2024 global public health emergency (PHEIC) declared by the WHO regarding the mpox outbreak by developing two assays designed to detect mpox virus and announcing plans to supply the products to countries in need. Among these, NovaplexTM MPXV/OPXV Assay (RUO) is designed to detect MPXV Clade I and Clade II as well as OPXV infections, while NovaplexTM HSV-1&2/VZV/MPXV Assay (RUO) is designed to simultaneously detect four viruses including MPXV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) Types 1 and 2, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). These products also comply with TPPs issued by the WHO. \"As the spread of mpox continues unabated, we have developed new RUO assays for detection of viruses causing the mpox to meet the increasing research demand from affected countries. We are committed to actively supporting global efforts to curb the spread of mpox,\" said Daniel Shin, Executive Vice-President and Chief Global Sales and Marketing Officer at Seegene. In 2022, Seegene had previously leveraged its proprietary reagent development expertise and automated reagent development system (SGDDS) to create the NovaplexTM MPXV Assay (RUO). From January 2024 to September 6, 2024, there have been a total of 24,851 suspected cases, 5,549 confirmed cases and 643 deaths reported across the member states in the African Union (AU), according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). The mpox variant is now spreading beyond African countries including Sweden, Pakistan, the Philippines, Jordan and Thailand. About Seegene Seegene has 23 years of dedicated experience in R&D, manufacturing, and business related to multiplex PCR technologies. This expertise was particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic when Seegene provided over 340 million COVID-19 tests to more than 100 countries worldwide. The core feature of Seegene's multiplex PCR technology is the ability to simultaneously test for 14 pathogens that cause similar symptoms in a single tube and provide quantitative information on the infection profile to correlate with the progression of illness.

            "description": "The 2024 campaign season's second general election debate and the first showdown between former President Donald Trump and US Vice President Kamala Harris will be a clash of contrasts. This comes months after the June debate between Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden, who later announced an end to his reelection bid and endorsed Harris after facing immense backlash over his lackluster performance and concerns around his age and fitness. Trump has attacked Harris multiple times since her abrupt rise to prominence, primarily on a personal level. Trump is most likely to target Harris on issues, ranging from questioning her race to her views on immigration, taxes, foreign policy, election involvement, etc. Watch this video to know where the two presidential candidates stand on key issues.",

            "description": "For Apple followers, the biggest tech day of the year is finally here: The Apple iPhone 16 launch event. It'll take place later today, September 9, at 1PM ET in Cupertino, CA, and you can stream it live on YouTube or the company's website. We'll also be live-blogging the news and hopefully will get a chance to check out the new iPhone after the event. The biggest news we're expecting from Apple's It's Glowtime event is the iPhone 16 lineup. Following past events, we're also anticipating a new Apple Watch or two. But a late-breaking update from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman suggests that we won't be seeing a full refresh on the Apple Watch Ultra line \u2014 just a new Ultra 2 color. (See below for details).Beyond that, rumors have been swirling about various changes to the AirPods line, including new noise-canceling models and maybe even a small refresh to the AirPods Max. And what about new M4 Macs, HomePods, iPad mini or even the baseline iPhone SE? Some of those may hit later this year, while others probably won't see the light of day until 2025 or beyond. But until Tim Cook takes the (virtual) stage, however, everything is pure speculation. With that said, let\u2019s get into the most likely leaks and rumors ahead of the Apple event.iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 ProNo matter what else happens, these new handsets will take center stage during the Apple event. That\u2019s good news for people ready for an upgrade. The bad (ish) news? The vast majority of leaks and rumors indicate that this will be another year of iterative improvements, so don\u2019t expect a game-changing new hardware feature.Cherlynn Low / EngadgetThere are likely to be four new models announced at the event, which is similar to what Apple did last year. The new phones will allegedly be called the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, according to industry analyst Mark Gurman. This is the exact same naming convention as last year\u2019s iPhone 15 reveal, so the rumors of Apple adopting an \u201ciPhone Ultra\u201d moniker seem to have been greatly exaggerated.Even if Apple doesn't use the Ultra naming, the Pro models might be getting slightly larger screens, which is always nice (if you like big phones, that is). The regular Pro is likely to move to 6.3 inches from 6.1 inches, while the Pro Max should hit 6.9 inches, an increase from 6.7 inches. Finally, there will likely be a new color or two, as always. Bloomberg\u2019s Gurman suggests that Apple is ready to ditch the blue model in favor of the return of rose gold. Separately, 9to5Mac has reported on a new \"gold-colored titanium\" hue for the iPhone 16 Pro model. Based on a source who apparently nailed last year's gray titanium color, they are showing off what appears to be more of a dusky sand hue than gold.On the hardware side of things, look for a new chipset that takes advantage of the company\u2019s recent push toward AI, also known as Apple Intelligence. Beyond that, the upgraded A18 chip will be an iterative improvement, specs-wise. As is typical, the Pro and Pro Max will likely get a more powerful chip than the standard models. It looks like the base amount of RAM here will be 8GB, so as to handle those aforementioned AI tasks.It\u2019s also been rumored that the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will get the Action Button, a feature introduced last year for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. This multi-purpose button is a direct replacement for the mute switch, by default, but can be adjusted to control a bunch of different things. The Action Button can be used to to change ringer settings, turn on the flashlight, launch the camera and more.Cherlynn Low/EngadgetThere\u2019s also talk of another new button, this one on the right side of the phone. This will control camera features, operating like a button on a DSLR. Reporting indicates that a soft press will trigger autofocus and a harder press will take a photo. Consumers may also be able to swipe along the button to zoom in and out while shooting photos or taking videos. It\u2019s been reported that this camera button will only come with the Pro and Pro Max, which makes sense since the high-end models typically offer a more robust camera experience.To that end, new iPhones always get a camera spec bump, but we don\u2019t know exactly what that will look like this time. It\u2019s been reported, however, that the iPhone 16\u2019s camera module could be getting a design refresh. Apple might be ditching the square and going with a vertical orientation. This might only apply to the base iPhone 16 and maybe the Plus, as the Pro and Pro Max phones tend to place a much higher emphasis on photos and videos.AppleWe already know what\u2019s coming on the software side of things, thanks to the recent WWDC event. Based on previous years, iOS 18 should be available within the week following the event. The software update features a more customizable Control Center and Home Screen. It'll also finally bring RCS support to iPhones.As for Apple Intelligence, you\u2019ll have to wait a bit. It was announced as part of iOS 18, but it\u2019s been delayed until iOS 18.1. This isn\u2019t a huge deal, as that OS refresh is expected in October, but does mean that early adopters of the iPhone 16 won\u2019t be able to fool around with AI right away.The new iPhone drop may also spell the end of Apple\u2019s widely panned FineWoven case, which was just introduced last year as an alternative to leather but has been criticized for durability issues. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman recently reported that FineWoven inventory is getting low, suggesting the company is either phasing it out or planning a refresh. One leaker on the Saturday ahead of the event shared a look at an array of iPhone cases in neutral colors, claiming these may be coming out in a new material to replace FineWoven.Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3Ever since 2016, iPhone events have also included a deep dive on the latest Apple Watch. This year looks to be no different. As a matter of fact, this is a big year for the Apple Watch. We are coming up on the gadget\u2019s tenth birthday, so there are conflicting rumors as to whether the next entry will be called the Apple Watch Series 10 or the Series X.No matter what it ends up being called, Apple\u2019s next standard smartwatch is reported to have a bigger screen that\u2019s more in line with the Ultra. It\u2019s expected that the company will ditch the 41mm form factor and introduce a 49mm design.Rumors have also suggested that Apple has completely redesigned the band system and added new connectors. This will likely make these straps easier to adjust, but there\u2019s a downside. This move could make it so all of those old bands no longer work.Cherlynn Low / EngadgetOf course, there\u2019s going to be a new chip to power these watches, but we don\u2019t have any specifics. It\u2019s been suggested that these chips have been designed to accommodate Apple\u2019s recent foray into AI, but that integration is likely to happen later on. For now, Apple Intelligence will be tethered to iPhone, iPad and Mac.There are likely to be two watches revealed at the event, which are codenamed N217 and N218. It\u2019s possible one of these will be the Apple Watch Ultra 3, though Mark Gurman at Bloomberg says the high-end smartwatch won\u2019t get a major redesign this time out. It\u2019ll likely be an iterative refresh.On the software front, it looks like Apple has run into some snags while developing long-anticipated health tracking tools. Health monitoring is one of the key features of the Apple Watch, so the company has been working on new sensors to detect high blood pressure and sleep apnea. However, the tech will likely not be ready for this year\u2019s smartwatch. Apple\u2019s also been developing a glucose sensor for almost a decade so, who knows, maybe it\u2019ll finally show up with the Series X.Finally, it\u2019s highly possible that Apple announces a new version of the budget-friendly Watch SE. This was last updated in 2022, so a refresh is overdue. There has been some reporting that Apple will be swapping out the aluminum exterior with a rigid plastic shell. This should help get costs down even further. As it stands, the Apple Watch SE is $250, but Samsung\u2019s cheapest wearable is the $200 Galaxy Watch FE. Apple may want to compete closer to that price range. Two new sets of AirPodsBilly Steele/EngadgetIt\u2019s been reported that Apple\u2019s prepping two new variants of its standard earbuds. According to a Bloomberg roundup that was published on September 6, Apple will introduce an entry-level model and a mid-tier version, which would effectively replace AirPods 2 and AirPods 3.The big news here is that both new AirPods versions are likely to transition to a USB-C case to keep pace with the iPhone and the second-gen AirPods Pro. It\u2019s been suggested that the cheaper of the two forthcoming models would lack wireless charging, but that the mid-tier version would support this technology. This is the same strategy Apple followed with previous generations, so it makes sense. The case for the more expensive AirPods may also include a speaker, which would make it easier to find with Apple's Find My feature. Both versions should feature similar designs, though the mid-tier variant is likely to support active noise cancellation like the Pro model. If that's the case, it's not really clear what's left to differentiate those earbuds from the AirPods Pro, but we'll find out soon enough.As for the AirPods Max, four years on, we might finally an updated model, too. In a tweet just a day before the big event, Mark Gurman says we could see a new pair of premium headphones. They'll get USB-C and \"better noise cancellation.\"One more thingThe iPhone event doesn\u2019t typically have a \u201cone more thing\u201d moment, but there\u2019s one piece of hardware that could get a surprise shout out. It\u2019s been rumored that Apple is preparing a massive redesign of the Mac mini, which would include ditching the USB-A port, according to Gurman. Analysts have suggested that this will be the company\u2019s smallest ever desktop computer and could be around the same size of an Apple TV streaming box.There will reportedly be two versions of the upcoming Mac Mini, one with the standard M4 chip and another with the more powerful M4 Pro chip. The base model is rumored to start shipping from suppliers this month, so it\u2019s possible Apple will spend a few minutes on the computer at the iPhone event. However, don\u2019t count on it. This is an event for iPhones and smartwatches and a miniaturized desktop could feel out of place. And, just like it did last fall, Apple could easily hold a Mac-specific event later this year.There's also a lot of noise online about an upcoming iPad mini refresh. Apple's smallest iPad hasn't had an update since 2021, and is currently \"considered 'constrained' internally,\" according to Gurman. While a new model is likely to come soon, it's not common for Apple to announce iPads during its iPhone event.Beyond that, a whole bunch of software updates are about to drop. There\u2019s iOS 18, which we\u2019ve written about extensively, and iPadOS 18. As for smartwatches, watchOS 11 is also coming out sometime this fall. Apple already detailed all three operating systems at WWDC, but the upcoming iPhone event would be a good time to announce official release dates.One... early thing?Here's something we know for sure: Apple has a updated Beats Powerbeats Pro update coming next year. Beats teased an update to the earbuds on its Instagram account on September 4 with a short Reel. In the clip, Los Angeles Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani swings a bat while wearing the upcoming earbuds, before a \"Powerbeats Pro 2\" wordmark and \"Coming 2025\" flash up on screen. That's it \u2014 there's no mention of specs, pricing, or a tighter release window, but we do at least see a tweaked design. You can read senior reporter Billy Steele's analysis of this glimpse here. Chances are we won't hear about this new set of buds at the iPhone event, but expect to see them adorning many more athlete and celebrity ears before long. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Beats by Dre (@beatsbydre) The Engadget Podcast with special guest Mark GurmanIn preparation for Apple's September 9 event, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman joined Engadget Podcast hosts Cherlynn Low and Devindra Hardawar to talk all things Apple.
