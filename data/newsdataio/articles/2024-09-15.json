Maybe it's because the first match of the Test series is in Chennai and the spin woes of the Indian batters in Sri Lanka were exhibited and exposed like never before. Maybe it's because Bangladesh spinners have enough ability to turn the heat on if push comes to shove.",

He showed glimpses of his brilliance in the recently concluded Durand Cup and carried that momentum into the new ISL season.It was a cagey start from both sides with plenty of tackles flying in, mostly to disrupt the momentum.Nandha Kumar was guilty of a mis-timed challenge in the third minute when he brought down Suresh Wangjam. The East Bengal FC winger received a yellow card for his reckless tackle.Despite the caution, tackles kept flying as Lalchungnunga and later Hector Yuste also joined Nandha into the referee's book.The first real opportunity of the game came when Jeakson Singh collected a loose ball outside the penalty area.

First, Connor Shields saw an effort blocked midway through the half before Farukh shot wide from close range.Samik prevented Odisha from going 2-0 up with a superb last-ditch save after Hnamte rattled the upright with an outstanding free-kick.The Marina Machans were .",

            "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday lauded recent changes in agricultural export policies, stating that easing export norms on basmati rice and onions, and increasing import duties on some edible oils will boost farmers' incomes and create rural jobs.On Friday, the government scrapped a USD 950 per tonne minimum export price (MEP) for basmati rice and removed a USD 550 per tonne MEP on onions, according to government statements.The government on Saturday raised import duty on crude palm oil to 20 per cent and on refined sunflower oil to 32.5 per cent, aiming to support domestic oilseed farmers and processors.In a post on X, Modi said the government is leaving no stone unturned to support farmers who work tirelessly for the country's food security.\"Whether it is reducing the export duty on onions or increasing the import duty on edible oils, many such decisions are going to greatly benefit our food producers. While these will increase their income, employment opportunities",

That was one centimeter more than his own Memorial Van Damme record set last year, and he said he was too tired to continue.Afterwards, he said his 100-meter victory over 400 hurdles world record-holder Karsten Warholm in Zurich last week took more out of him than expected.My legs felt terrible tonight and I'm just really tired, Duplantis said. \"It's been a crazy couple of weeks: The race against Karsten and then I had to jump the day after. That took a lot more from my body that I expected.With 6.11 I got a good result",
