Moreover, this court cannot grant any such declaration. Interlocutory application is dismissed,\" the bench ordered.During the hearing, the bench asked the counsel what advantage the city would get if it was declared a heritage city and what were the provisions under law to give such a declaration.The counsel said that Agra needed to be declared a heritage city as it has a history of over 1,000 years and several historic monuments which need to be preserved.\"Declaring Agra as a heritage city would give a boost to tourism",

He last played a first-class game in December 2018.Pandya remains India's best pace bowling all-rounder by a distance with the likes of Shivam Dube and Nitish Reddy way behind the colourful cricketer from Baroda.The videos posted on social media suggest that the all-rounder is trying to ramp up his workload before the Bangladesh T20 series in Octobe",

The only Test match between Afghanistan and New Zealand has been abandoned in Greater Noida due to persistent rains in Delhi-NCR for the last three days. The AFG vs NZ Test became only the eighth such match in history to be abandoned without a ball being bowled on all five days. There was the possibility of play on the first couple of days, especially with sun shining, however, a poor drainage system meant that the even the toss didn't take place due to wet outfield and the rain in the next three days almost made the play impossible.",

Pandya, who last played a Test match for India in September 2018 on the England tour, has had a struggle with injuries and hence has focussed on white-ball cricket for the last few years. However, since coming back from a long layoff, following the injury he suffered during the ODI World Cup last year, Pandya has looked the fittest and has gotten through the IPL, T20 World Cup and the Sri Lanka series unscathed.",

The Trinamool Congress leader's outburst came after agitating junior doctors, even after reaching the gates of the state secretariat Nabanna, refused to hold talks with the state government unless their demand for live streaming of the meeting to resolve the RG Kar hospital impasse was met.",

The pilots want to be paid wages competitive with their U.S. counterparts.The two sides will be in a position starting Sunday to issue a 72-hour notice of a strike or lockout.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the announcement in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, calling it a follow-up to U.S. President Joe Biden's announcement two years ago that the U.S. supports expanding the 15-member body.While Africa has three non-permanent seats on the Security Council, that doesn't allow African countries to deliver the full benefit of their knowledge and voices, she said.That is why, in addition to non-permanent membership for African countries, the United States supports creating two permanent seats for Africa on the council, Thomas-Greenfield said. It's what our African partners seek, and it's what we believe is just.However, a senior U.S. administration official, who spoke on condition of ...",

The campaign to target Beijing this week shows how curbing China's power has emerged as a rare issue of political consensus.But some measures did pass along party lines, with Republicans arguing the need to protect national security when it comes to everything from education to farmland, and Democrats raising concerns about discrimination. The advocacy group Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote also warned about overly broad anti-China rhetoric.One contentious measure seeks to revive a Trump-era program to root out Beijing's spying in American universities and institutes. The bills all still need ...",

No one was injured in the incident that occurred around 11.30 am at the busy Kismat junction on Veer Savarkar Marg in Dadar West, they said. It created a 3 feet X 5 feet crater. Traffic police with the help of locals pulled out the car from the crater after the cave-in, which briefly disrupted vehicular movement in Dadar. A video purportedly showing the incident surfaced on social media. In a statement, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said the road caved in due to leakage from a 66-inch underground pipeline. The leakage was on the down part of the pipeline, which was noticed after the crater was deepened through digging as part of repair efforts, it said. The pipeline repair was delayed due to scheduled water supply in the locality, the statement said, adding it was finally undertaken in the evening. Repairs will take time and water supply .",

It remains to be seen whether the new charges will be included in the retrial, as prosecutors hope, or handled as a separate case by the court.The new charges come after prosecutors in Britain .",

            "description": "An Israeli airstrike last month demolished the top floor of a guest house in Gaza where World Food Program international staff were staying, the UN agency's director said Thursday, calling the situation impossibly dangerous for aid workers trying to feed the Palestinian population.The previously undisclosed incident occurred Aug 31 in the Nuseirat refugee camp, just days after WFP temporarily stopped aid deliveries to northern Gaza and halted staff movements when its team came under fire near an Israel checkpoint.\"It was always dangerous before. It's become impossibly dangerous now,\" McCain said.The World Food Programme is in touch with the Israeli Defence Force over the strike on the house where 11 UN employees, including 10 WFP staff, were staying. None was injured and they have been evacuated to Jordan, where McCain met with them this week.The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment.McCain said she has a simple message for Israeli Prime Minister .",
