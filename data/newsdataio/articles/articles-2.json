            "description": "The growing frenzy of paparazzi culture in Bollywood is increasingly becoming a concern for celebrities. Many stars, including Janhvi Kapoor, have expressed frustration over the constant attention they receive. Several actors have stated that they do not inform the paparazzi about their whereabouts, yet they often find photographers waiting for them at locations where they are not allowed. Janhvi Kapoor has frequently mentioned in interviews that she never invites photographers to click her outside the gym or in other casual settings, apart from airports and film promotion events. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Varinder Chawla (@vbollywood_official) Recently, Janhvi was seen during promotions for her upcoming film \"Devara,\" but the actress appeared displeased with the paparazzi\u2019s behavior. The photographers were seen pushing each other in an attempt to capture her, which visibly left Janhvi annoyed. Although she calmly allowed the paparazzi to take pictures as she walked to her vanity van, the chaos caused by the photographers led her to express her frustration. She reportedly asked them not to push one another before entering her van without posing further.

However, the situation remained chaotic due to the intense behavior of the photographers. Janhvi Kapoor is making her debut in the South Indian film industry with \"Devara,\" starring alongside Jr. NTR from \"RRR.\" Dressed in a turquoise outfit with intricate pearlwork, Janhvi looked stunning. Her beauty and popularity often make her a prime target for paparazzi eager to capture her in their lenses.",

            "description": "The Jammu and Kashmir Police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) after a female Flying Officer accused a Wing Commander of the Air Force Station in Srinagar of sexual assault. The FIR has been lodged against the Wing Commander at the Budgam Police Station under Section 376(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, which deals with aggravated rape by persons in positions of authority.The female Flying Officer alleged that the Wing Commander sexually assaulted her in his room during a New Year's party held at the Officers' Mess on December 31, 2023. She recounted the events of the night, stating that the assault occurred at around 2:00 AM on January 1, 2024, after Wing Commander allegedly took her to his room under the guise of giving her a gift. Once there, the Wing Commander allegedly molested her. \"I repeatedly asked him to stop and tried to resist in all ways possible. Finally, I pushed him and ran away,\" she stated.Following the incident, she said she was in shock and unsure of how to proceed, fearing further repercussions if she reported the crime. \"I was afraid and didn't know what to do as there were instances before where I was discouraged from reporting. He visited my office after the incident, behaving as if nothing happened, without any sign of remorse,\" she recounted.She confided in two other female officers, who advised her to file a formal complaint.The Flying Officer further narrated her struggles to submit a complaint and alleged mishandling of the investigation by the Internal Committee. Following her complaint, a Colonel-rank officer was assigned to investigate. She claimed that the accused Wing Commander was made to sit with her twice in January to record statements in violation of standard protocols. She said she objected to his presence, and the investigation was later closed, allegedly to \"hide mistakes of the administration.\"The Flying Officer then filed a fresh application to the internal committee, which convened two months later. \"The internal committee did not perform its duties properly, as directions had come from higher authorities to keep the results neutral. Everyone was aiding the sexual offender,\" she alleged.Despite her insistence, no medical examination was conducted until much later, the victim claimed.Her requests for interim relief, leave, or a different posting for either herself or the Wing Commander were allegedly denied. \"I am forced to socialise with these people and attend events with my abuser,\" she claimed in her complaint.The internal committee ultimately deemed the case inconclusive due to the lack of eyewitnesses and closed its investigation in May. \"Isn't it common sense that someone would not commit sexual assault in front of a witness?\" she questioned.The Flying Officer has also reported \"continuous mental harassment\" and \"social boycott,\" with her personal communications being unofficially monitored. \"The individuals I speak with are harassed by the authorities,\" she said.The female offer stated that the harassment severely affected her mental health, leading her to experience suicidal thoughts. \"I am living in constant fear, under 24/7 scrutiny, and my social life has been completely disrupted. The harassment has driven me to suicidal thoughts, and I feel utterly helpless. I am unable to carry on with my daily life, and my social interactions are closely monitored and discouraged by authorities. I have endured this torture for too long, and I am at my breaking point,\" she expressed in her complaint.She has urged the police to take immediate action and ensure that justice is served, naming several senior officers as complicit in her harassment.ALSO READ | 'Justice Hema Committee Formed As Left Is In Power': Kerala CM Responds After HC Raps 'Inaction'IAF Says Cooperating With Probe Into CaseThe Indian Air Force has acknowledged the case and confirmed its cooperation with local authorities. \"We are aware of the case.

We are completely cooperating towards the case,\" an IAF spokesperson told ABP Live.An Inspector-rank officer from the Budgam Police Station has been assigned to oversee the investigation of this case.",

            "description": "Glorious Gaming just released its latest flagship keyboard, the GMMK 3. The company didn\u2019t skimp on the bells and whistles with this one. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s calling the GMMK 3 the \u201cworld\u2019s most customizable keyboard.\u201dTo that end, the keyboard offers nine points of modularity, from the keycaps to the switch plates, cables, accent pieces and, well, \u201cevery aesthetic part of the keyboard, from top and bottom.\u201d Glorious Gaming says there are so many ways to customize this model, that it\u2019s actually \u201cover one billion keyboards in one.\u201dGaming keyboards, however, are about way more than aesthetics. Fortunately, the GMMK 3 checks all of the boxes for premium keyboard features. There are Hall Effect sensors, support for a rapid trigger feature and up to an 8,000 Hz polling rate. There\u2019s also customizable actuation and 4:1 dynamic keystroke mapping. There\u2019s even a modular gasket system to adjust the precise sound and feel of keystrokes.Some of the customization comes into play during the ordering process. The online configurator lets you select the color scheme and make other adjustments. There are also a bunch of accessories available, including key capsules, badges, rotary knobs and more. Additionally, each keyboard is available in three sizes.Glorious Gaming Beyond sizing, the keyboards are split into three different versions. There\u2019s the standard GMMK 3, which includes everything mentioned above, but the max polling rate shoots down to 1,000 Hz. The GMMK 3 Pro ships with a durable full aluminum body, but keeps that max polling rate of 1,000 Hz. The baddest of the bunch, the GMMK 3 Pro HE, includes the advertised 8,000 Hz polling rate, along with a revamped RGB lighting system and other goodies.Finally, there are \u201cbarebones\u201d versions of each keyboard that don\u2019t include switches or keycaps, so you can hit the ground running when it comes to customization. All of the keyboards come with tools to help remove switches and keycaps, but it\u2019s nice to have that part of the job finished already.The GMMK 3 is available now in all of its many configurations. Prices range from $120 to $260.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/glorious-gamings-gmmk-3-is-a-flagship-keyboard-with-tons-of-premium-features-130100429.html?src=rss",

            "description": "Fixed deposits (FDs) have long been a popular choice amongst investors for offering assured returns and safety from market volatility. Among the different types of FDs available today, compounding FDs are an attractive option that offers higher returns with the power of compound interest. Let\u2019s understand how they work and what benefits they offer to investors looking to grow their investments.How Does a Compounding FD Work?In the case of a compounding fixed deposit, the interest earned is periodically added to the principal instead of being paid out, which is known as the compounding effect. The interest typically compounds on a quarterly or annual basis. Over time, you earn interest not only on the original principal but also on interest accumulated from the past. As a result, your investment grows faster as compared to a simple interest FD, where interest is calculated solely on the initial principal.For instance, you invest Rs 1,00,000 in a compounding FD with a 7 per cent interest rate, compounded quarterly. Interest for the first quarter will be calculated on the initial deposit of Rs 1,00,000. In the next quarter, interest will be calculated on Rs 1,01,750 (principal plus interest from the first quarter), and this process continues. With compounding, your investment can grow exponentially, especially over a longer tenure as interest is earned on both the principal and accumulated interest.Benefits of Compounding FDsHigher returns: One of key advantages of a compounding FD is the potential for higher returns due to compound interest. It allows you the chance to grow your savings faster than a simple interest FD would.Safety and stability: Fixed deposits are one of the safest investment options available. Offering guaranteed returns and zero market risk, they are ideal for conservative investors or those looking to balance their portfolio.Flexible tenures: Compounding FDs are available for a variety of tenures, allowing you to choose a tenure that aligns with your short-term or long-term financial goals.Reinvestment opportunities: At the end of your FD tenure, you can reinvest the maturity amount in another compounding FD, further boosting your wealth-building efforts.Tax ImplicationsThe interest earned on fixed deposits is considered taxable income under the Income Tax Act. It is added to your total income and taxed according to your applicable income tax slab rate. However, FDs with a 5-year lock-in period qualify for tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The amount invested in such FDs is eligible for a deduction up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum. But the interest earned on these FDs is still taxable.If you withdraw the FD before its maturity, banks usually impose a penalty, such as lowering the interest rate of the FD. The tax treatment remains the same, with TDS deducted as applicable. When filing your taxes, remember to declare the interest income from FDs under \u2018Income from Other Sources.\u2019 Also ensure that the TDS deducted by the bank is accounted for when filing your returns. If TDS has been deducted but your total taxable income falls below the taxable threshold, you can claim a refund for the excess TDS paid.Compounding FDs are a powerful investment tool that can boost your returns by leveraging the benefits of compound interest. The key lies in understanding how it works so you can choose the right FD to meet your short or long-term goals. The author is the AGM Communication at Bankbazaar.com.

            "description": "India\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow at 6.7 per cent in the 2024-25 fiscal year (FY25) on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, the latest report by Nomura revealed. The brokerage\u2019s estimate places India\u2019s economic growth 50 basis points (bps) lower than the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI\u2019s) expectations for the current fiscal year. The RBI earlier gave a GDP growth estimate of 7.2 per cent for FY25. The analysts at the brokerage noted that they expect a downside risk to the growth projections of 7.2 per cent for the 2025-26 financial year (FY26), reported Moneycontrol.The report tracked the growth in auto sales, including passenger vehicles (PVs), and medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs), and found that the figures for July and August both were \u2018disappointing\u2019.\u201cGrowth signals are currently mixed. Catch-up in government spending and rural demand are positives, but softness in consumer discretionary demand, industrial demand and external demand are negatives,\u201d the report noted.Also Read : PAN Card-Based KYC: Online & Offline Methods To Required Documents; Everything You Need to Know\u201cTo gauge cyclical growth, we have found that sales of passenger vehicles (PV) and medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) are important. PVs signal discretionary consumer demand, while MHCV sales have a high beta to overall industrial activity,\u201d the report added. The brokerage analysed the vehicle sales to oversee cyclical growth and highlighted that the statistics showed a slump. Nomura further stated that the net GDP growth is set to dampen to 6.7 per cent on a YoY basis in FY25, slipping below the RBI\u2019s projection of 7.2 per cent. \"PV and MHCV sales both disappointed in July and August. Wholesale PV sales growth fell to -2.0 per cent YoY in July and -2.5 per cent in August, while MHCV sales growth declined to -7.1 per cent and -10.7 per cent, respectively. Inventories for PVs have risen from 55-60 days in May to 70-75 days in August, with hopes now pinned on the festive season,\" the brokerage noted.",

            "description": "There is a lot of discussion happening on the recently released web series based on the IC 814 hijack of 1999. The series is produced by Netflix and is directed by Anubhav Sinha. Both have a reputation and track record of being leftist, over-the-top liberal and anti-India. Sinha came out in support of the anti-CAA protests based entirely on a lie. In his earlier movies, he has twisted the known facts quite shamelessly. It is therefore not a surprise if the sensitive topic of IC 814 is used and misused to peddle agendas instead of a straightforward story telling. The general discussion has so far been directed to only one point \u2013 the names of the hijackers being Bhola and Shanker. Sinha has been less than honest in using these names and never revealing the true identities of these people. This is, however a very minor matter when compared to the more serious messages conveyed in the series. A few such are listed here. Is it fact or fiction? : The disclaimer at the start says it is a work of fiction. And that\u2019s the biggest lie Sinha peddles. The entire series is based entirely on the IC 814 events. The film includes actual video footage of the TV coverage. The clips of then Prime Minister, External Affairs Minister and the National Security Advisor are used in the film directly as a part of the story. After all this to call it a work of fiction is one of the biggest acts of dishonesty anyone can commit. This one aspect alone leaves the producer Netflix and the director Sinha with no credibility whatsoever. 2. Was the goal to show Pak as the nice guy? Totally expected from the Indian leftists. The series gives a clean chit to Pak while cleverly mixing it up in the naturally disturbing story. There are two clear instances: a. A Pak ATC officer gives a totally artificial lecture to one of the hijackers about the true teachings of Islam. The scene also hints that Pakistanis are honest people doing their duty without any bias. b. In the end, we are told that the released terrorists had a celebration in Kandahar with Osama Bin Laden where no ISI officer was present. This apparently is enough for us to believe that ISI had no role in the hijacking!! 3. Why Naseeruddin Shah? He gives a pathetic performance. It is pretty clear he did no preparation and simply sleepwalked into the role. It reminds one of Om Puri\u2019s similarly incompetent performance as the navy chief in the movie \u2018Gazi attack\u2019 where he is totally unfit for the part. Both have been great actors but your reputation unfortunately does nothing for you once the camera starts rolling just as the reputation of a great cricketer doesn\u2019t matter once he steps on the pitch. So, Naseer seems to be there more because he is a leftist than anything else. On more than one occasion, it appears he was voicing his personal opinions rather than a scripted dialog. As an example, in a critical situation, when a decision needs to be taken within minutes, he says, \u201cthe PM will have to consult all coalition partners and only then he can decide.\u201d No emergency is handled this way \u2013 even by a coalition government. Besides, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the PM who crossed the nuclear threshold. Did he call up all partners for the decision? 4. When asked why they are doing this, the hijacker \u2013 multiple times in the series \u2013 claims this is to avenge what happened to their country and refers to Afghanistan. This is when the Taliban was already ruling Afghanistan, a Pakistani national\u2019s release from Indian custody was demanded, and the hijackers were all from Pakistan. By giving a vague purpose, the real jihadi agenda, which is now well known, is almost diluted. 5. The Indian senior officials are initially shown to be very casual and almost irresponsible while interested more about inter groups rivalries than the national security. These same people later risk their lives and do a commendable job in a very difficult situation. The contradiction simply doesn\u2019t look believable. 6. The series tells us that the commando operation at Amritsar couldn\u2019t be done because the then Punjab CM didn\u2019t give the go ahead to the commando team of Punjab police which was ready for the action. We are also told that the then CM of J&K was not at all ready to release one of the terrorists and the centre had to trick him into it. We do not know if both these are facts. If not, then clearly these have been manufactured to support a political agenda. The series has its positives. It\u2019s well made from a cinematic standpoint. The use of visual effects such as of the ariel shots are stunning. Vijay Varma is a consummate actor and gives a superb performance as the captain of the ill-fated flight. As does the veteran Pankaj Kapoor in the role of Jaswant Singh with a very unnecessarily changed name to justify the \u2018fiction\u2019 bluff. The locations are well chosen and look authentic. However, the real question that arises here is ethical. Can events which have had severe impact on the national psyche, and which are very much in living memory, be allowed to be twisted from clearly known facts? Is this creative freedom or deliberate distortion of history? As an example, if someone shows that Osama Bin Laden offered water and food to the American commandos when they reached his hideout in Pakistan, will the American audience accept it in the name of \u2018fiction based on real events\u2019?",

            "description": "Expanded network of consulting experts will help clients maximize generative AI investments, optimize compute and implementation costs ARMONK, N.Y., Sept. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced it has expanded its consulting services and solutions to help clients derive greater value from Oracle's cloud applications and technology and extend generative AI with an open, orchestrated approach. IBM Corporation logo. The average cost of compute spend is expected to increase by 89% between 2023 and 2025, according to new research from the IBM Institute for Business Value. In addition, 42% of executives report concern that inadequate expertise could preclude progress with generative AI. To help clients address these growing challenges, IBM Consulting is launching an expanded network of consultants to support Oracle clients, including thousands of consultants worldwide who are certified across core Oracle technologies \u2013 such as OCI Generative AI, OCI AI Services, and OCI Data Science \u2013 as well as deeply skilled in the IBM watsonx AI and data platform. The consultants will be committed to helping clients extend high value generative AI use cases coupled with traditional AI and automation solutions, aimed to maximize their return-on-investment and optimize compute and implementation costs. That includes helping clients choose and deploy the right fit-for-purpose AI models for their unique requirements, including enterprise-grade models such as IBM Granite, open source or other third-party models. With their deep skills in IBM watsonx and technologies from IBM's open ecosystem of business partners, IBM consultants can help guide clients' critical decisions around technology architecture, generative AI and software licensing, data and analytics architecture, security risks and more to enhance automation of their workflows and help establish a stronger and more cost-efficient technology foundation for developing and deploying generative AI applications. In addition, IBM just announced its intent to acquire Accelalpha, a global Oracle services provider with deep expertise helping clients digitize core business operations and accelerate adoption of Oracle Cloud Applications, further expanding IBM's Oracle consulting expertise. \"Our clients are eager to extend generative AI initiatives but they're also concerned about rising compute costs, lack of in-house AI skills, AI assistant sprawl, and management oversight,\" said Corinne Koppel, Global Oracle Practice Leader, IBM Consulting. \"We're proud to bring clients even more skills and solutions to help them optimize their investments with Oracle's full stack generative AI technology leveraging an open architecture.\" Helping Extend Oracle Fusion Applications IBM Consulting is already helping Oracle clients apply generative AI, traditional AI and automation in domain and industry-specific solutions to complement Oracle Fusion Applications' embedded AI offerings. For example, IBM Consulting has helped Oracle Fusion Applications customers expand use cases in human resources, procurement and sourcing, finance and the public sector. Accelerating clients' time to value with IBM Consulting Advantage IBM consultants supporting Oracle clients bring the power of the AI-powered engagement platform, IBM Consulting Advantage, to help accelerate clients' time-to-value and improve consistency, repeatability, quality and speed-of-delivery.

            "description": "Lunit SCOPE IO\u00ae demonstrates potential to assess immune phenotype as an AI-powered biomarker for predicting efficacy of Nivolumab plus Chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer, independent of PD-L1 status SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lunit (KRX:328130.KQ), a leading provider of AI-powered solutions for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, today announced the presentation of a significant study at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain, from September 13-17. Lunit's AI-powered histopathology analyzer, Lunit SCOPE IO While Nivolumab plus chemotherapy has recently been approved as a standard first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer (AGC), its efficacy varies among patients. This variability underscores the critical need for reliable biomarkers to predict treatment response. Lunit's study addresses this pressing need, potentially offering a new tool to optimize patient care and treatment decisions. Conducted in collaboration with leading Korean medical institutions, the research showcases the potential of Lunit's AI-powered histopathology analyzer, Lunit SCOPE IO\u00ae, in predicting treatment response and guiding treatment decisions for AGC via assessment of immune phenotype. The study analyzed H&E images from 585 AGC patients, with Lunit SCOPE IO\u00ae classifying tumors into two immune phenotypes\u2014inflamed (IIP) and non-inflamed\u2014based on the presence and distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides that are readily available from a standard clinical workup. This classification provided valuable insights into the tumor microenvironment and helped predict treatment response, particularly in cases where traditional biomarkers like PD-L1 may not provide a complete picture. Key findings include: 1. Patients treated with Nivolumab+Chemotherapy showed significantly longer median progression-free survival (mPFS) compared to Chemotherapy alone (8.2 vs. 5.9 months).2. The inflamed immune phenotype group, classified by Lunit SCOPE IO\u00ae, was associated with more pronounced PFS benefits from Nivolumab+Chemotherapy: IIP: 5.2 months longer PFS for Niv+Chemo (mPFS of 11.0 vs 5.8 months) Non-IIP: only 1.4 months longer PFS for Niv+Chemo (mPFS of 7.3 vs 5.9 months) 3. The predictive value of IIP was consistent across different PD-L1 expression levels.4. Multivariate analysis confirmed IIP as an independent factor for PFS in patients treated with Nivolumab+Chemotherapy. \"By demonstrating that our AI-powered immune phenotype analysis can predict treatment response independently of PD-L1 status, we're opening new possibilities for tailoring treatments in AGC,\" said Brandon Suh, CEO of Lunit. \"This is particularly significant because gastric cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, representing 7.7% of all cancer cases. Our AI technology has the potential to enhance the precision of treatment decisions, potentially leading to more effective therapies and better quality of life for patients with AGC.\" Please visit Lunit's poster session at 1411P to discover more about our findings and the innovative capabilities of Lunit SCOPE IO\u00ae.

            "description": "Meets the need for stable and seamless communication on large film sets Supports up to 20 full-duplex wireless headsets Capable of handling a maximum of six channels Features seamless roaming for uninterrupted communication Boasts a 1,600ft (500m) LOS range Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC) headsets SHENZHEN, China, Sept. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As a leading provider of professional wireless intercom solutions, Hollyland has launched its newest high-end product, the Solidcom C1 Pro - Roaming Hub, specifically designed for large-scale film and television productions. Hollyland Elevates Wireless Communications for Large-Scale Film and TV Productions Incorporating Hollyland's cutting-edge roaming technology, the Solidcom C1 Pro - Roaming Hub addresses the common on-set challenge of obtaining stable communication links in larger or more complex areas, delivering an impeccable shooting experience to crews in a wide range of environments and scenarios. Built for the Big Stage The Solidcom C1 Pro - Roaming Hub revolutionizes film and TV production with its ability to connect up to 20 full-duplex headsets with a single hub, minimizing communication gaps, even in the most intricate filming environments. In addition, the effective range of a single hub has increased from the previous max LOS of 1,100ft (350m) to a robust 1,600ft (500m), bolstering reliability and flexibility on large sets. It also supports up to six communication groups, making it ideal for streamlined coordination across various departments like production, camera, and lighting, with added role and number customization for enhanced on-set efficiency. Stay Connected, Roam Free On complex film sets, communication is frequently hindered by obstructions and the need for constant reconnection as crew members move and reposition. This can have major impacts on a team's overall ability to communicate effectively and adhere to a shooting schedule. The Solidcom C1 Pro - Roaming Hub has powerful roaming capabilities and is designed for rapid movement and communication over long distances needs. When the wireless headset of the Solidcom C1 Pro - Roaming Hub enters the boundary area of the coverage of two hubs, the system will automatically identify and switch to the hub base with a stronger signal and disconnect from the original hub base. The switching process is swift, the user's communication connection will not be affected, and the voice quality will always remain clear and stable. Even if the user moves quickly in a complex environment, the communication will not be interrupted due to signal loss. Hollyland's self-developed roaming technology ensures that the headsets can be used in a complex and long-range environment, and the communication between each crew member is always crystal-clear and free. This allows film and TV crews to communicate more effectively without being constrained by the complexity of the filming location, physical environment, or signal environment. Smart App Control The Solidcom C1 Pro - Roaming Hub comes with an easy-to-use mobile app control, eliminating complicated cascading and grouping of multiple hubs in a traditional wireless intercom system. Thanks to the hub's built-in Bluetooth communication module, users can easily access to modify settings directly from their mobile devices. Bid farewell to long walks to the hub just for parameter adjustments. Superb Compatibility The Solidcom C1 Pro - Roaming Hub is compatible with the Solidcom C1 and C1 Pro headsets. It offers two industry-standard mounting holes, 5/8\" and 3/8\", which directly enable the attachment of a wide variety of accessories, such as tripods, light stands, and more for easy, hassle-free installations on-site. The Roaming Hub edition also retains many of its predecessor's advantages, including Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC), the PTT function for crews accustomed to communicating via walkie-talkie, and USB Audio Class (UAC), facilitating real-time online communication with off-site personnel. Filming Efficiency Made Easy On large-scale film and TV productions, teamwork efficiency and synchronization across various departments and crew work together to bring the directors vision to life. \"The Hollyland product upgrade is a tailored solution designed to address the long-standing challenges in the industry and ensure smooth, ultra-efficient communication capabilities in more places,\" said Sunny Zhou, the Chief Technology Officer of Hollyland. Pricing and Availability The Solidcom C1 Pro - Roaming Hub 20-Person Noise Cancelling Headset Intercom System is priced at $12,179, and the Solidcom Roaming Hub Base is priced at $5,999.

            "description": "ANAHEIM, Calif., Sept. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Anker, a global leader in charging, power delivery, and power storage, has been diligently exploring the genuine requirements of users. Survey findings indicate that in the United States, users are particularly concerned about the performance of solar and storage systems in extreme weather conditions, from scorching summers to frigid winters. To address these challenges, Anker has introduced the latest iteration of its Anker SOLIX X1 Solar & Storage Solution at RE+ 2024. Specifically designed to excel in both extreme heat and cold, the Anker SOLIX X1 is positioned as the premier year-round choice for users. In contrast to the architecture of the disconnector + DC-coupled all-in-one machine, Anker adopts an innovative modular dual-optimization architecture - the microinverter (MLPE - Power Optimization on the Roof) + AC coupling module energy storage (MLPE - Energy Optimization under the Roof) solution. This architecture inherently brings higher power generation, greater scalability (both photovoltaic and energy storage are optimized at the module level to maximize energy capacity and the utilization of sunlight), stronger resilience (a failure of a single module does not affect others), and higher safety performance (0V disconnection of the alternating current system / battery). It also exhibits superior performance in extreme environments and special scenarios: Response ability during large-scale power outages 1. When confronted with increasingly frequent large-scale power outages triggered by extreme weather or failures of power grid systems, Anker offers the most resilient and comprehensive whole-home backup power. Compared to numerous manufacturers that can only provide a single backup power solution, Anker enables its users to fully leverage their existing generators and seamlessly switch among multiple modes through the highly compatible X1 system. Simultaneously, by accessing National Weather Service disaster information, the system will automatically charge from the photovoltaic and power grid sides at the maximum rate, and a 10kWh system can be fully charged in under three hours. Through a comprehensive multi-energy solution, it guarantees the availability of electricity during disasters, realizes a more flexible and powerful backup power solution, ensures the continuity and stability of household electricity, and eliminates the hassle of power outages. Performance stability in extreme weather environments 2. Anker SOLIX X1 Solar & Storage Solution ensures consistent, full power capacity in extreme temperatures, ranging from a frigid -40\u00b0F to a scorching 149\u00b0F, all year round. For example, during the severe heatwave that recently affected the southern region in the United States, where temperatures surged past 122\u00b0F, the system continued to operate efficiently without any performance degradation up to 131\u00b0F. This capability surpasses traditional systems, which often see a decline in performance above 113\u00b0F. The system's resilience in extreme temperatures is due to the selection of superior components and a strategically designed internal temperature distribution that enhances thermal redundancy. In colder climates, like in the northern states preparing for winter where temperatures can dip to -4\u00b0F, most energy storage systems suffer significant performance drops or fail to charge. However, the Anker SOLIX X1 is equipped with advanced thermal boosting technology within the battery pack, ensuring that it maintains full charging and discharging capabilities at -4\u00b0F with 100% power efficiency. Adaptability to complex environments 3. In the face of challenging environments such as humidity, corrosion, and flooding, Anker effortlessly manages these conditions. During the recent heavy rains and floods that affected many states this past June and July, especially in coastal areas, the need for robust energy systems became apparent. Energy storage systems without adequate anti-corrosion and moisture resistance features often require extensive maintenance and restart efforts once the weather clears. In contrast, the X1 solution has successfully withstood a rigorous 1000-hour neutral salt spray test, significantly exceeding the industry standard of 480 hours and achieving a C5-M anti-corrosion level. Furthermore, the system is equipped with a standard wall-mounted installation to prevent immersion and provide maximum protection against salt erosion and tidal effects. Economy and efficiency of solar and storage 4. Thanks to the newly released microinverter, the X1 offers stronger flexibility and endurance, enabling users to overcome shading problems and maximizing the utilization of roof space. Its advanced frequency shift and algorithmic control helps the solution support a ratio of installed PV rated output power to ESS rated output power of up to 300%. Traditional systems are typically limited to a ratio of 100% to 150%. With this capability, a user can create more powerful and flexible PV systems, optimized for low-light conditions and scaled up to six parallel energy storage units for a total capacity of 180 kWh. Anker has been dedicated to assisting users in achieving energy independence, not only in ordinary scenarios to ensure daily energy independence (helping users save money), but also in special scenarios where energy independence is urgently required, truly achieving \"Live in Power\". The Anker SOLIX X1 Solar and Storage Solution marks further progress in the field of energy independence and reflects their steadfast commitment to the principles of \"Power Resilience\" and \"Most Accessible\".

            "description": "Junior doctors in Kolkata have refused to comply with the Supreme Court's directive to resume duties by 5 PM on Tuesday, as they continue their protest demanding justice for the rape and murder of a post-graduate trainee doctor. The protest, which started on August 9, followed the discovery of the victim\u2019s body in the seminar room of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Despite the Supreme Court's request for the protesting doctors to resume work by the given deadline, the junior doctors remain firm in their decision to continue the \"cease work\" protest until their demands are addressed. One of the primary demands includes the removal of senior officials, including the Kolkata Police Commissioner, the Health Secretary, the Director of Health Services, and the Director of Medical Education. Justice for RG Kar banners surface during India's heartbreaking 0-3 Intercontinental Cup loss to Syria (WATCH) One of the protesting doctors stated, \"We will not return to work until our demands are met. The state government was expected to remove the named officials by 5 PM, but no action has been taken, so the protest continues. However, we are open to dialogue.\" On Monday, the Supreme Court urged the doctors to return to their duties, ensuring that no adverse actions, such as punitive transfers, would be taken against them. This assurance came after the West Bengal government confirmed that no disciplinary action would be enforced if the doctors resumed work. The protests have drawn significant attention, as the junior doctors are determined to continue their strike until their demands are fully addressed. They seek accountability and justice for the deceased trainee doctor and have called for stronger action from the authorities. Kolkata rape-murder horror: 'CM is lying...' Victim's mother accuses Mamata of lying about compensation offer The cease-work movement, which began on August 9, has now entered a critical phase as the healthcare sector in Kolkata remains crippled, with junior doctors standing firm in their demand for change. The situation continues to evolve as discussions between the government and the protesting doctors remain on the table.",

            "description": "New Delhi: The Centre on Tuesday announced several key changes to simplify approval processes for telecom licenses and wireless equipment, in its bid to further pursue structural reforms and ease of doing business in the telecom sector. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) introduced changes to the approval processes for issuing Experimental Licenses, Demonstration Licenses, and Equipment Type Approvals (ETA). These changes are based on the recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). \u201cThese reforms are aimed at reducing delays and simplifying regulatory requirements, fostering innovation and streamlining operations for businesses and telecom operators,\u201d said the DoT. For Experimental Licenses cases not requiring inter-ministerial consultation, the license will be deemed issued after 30 days if no decision is conveyed. In cases requiring inter-ministerial consultation, the DoT will seek comments within seven days of receiving a complete application.\u201cIf no comments are received, a provisional license will be granted after 60 days, which will be converted to a regular license after 90 days, provided there are no adverse comments,\u201d said the Ministry of Communications. Similarly, for Demonstration Licenses, licenses without inter-ministerial consultation will be deemed granted after 15 days. For those requiring consultation, licenses will be deemed granted after 45 days once comments are sought from relevant authorities. If any unfavourable inter-ministerial comments are received during the approval process, the provisional license will be cancelled, and the experiment must be stopped immediately, said the DoT. All the applications of Equipment Type Approvals (ETA) for license-exempt wireless devices will now be granted on a self-declaration basis. According to the government, this process is expected to significantly reduce the time and effort required for approvals, \u201cbenefiting companies looking to deploy wireless equipment in the Indian market\u201d. \"Additionally, ETA holders are reminded to obtain the necessary clearances, such as a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), before importing equipment into India,\" said the DoT.

Jawahar Lal, who had previously contested elections on a BJP ticket, represents a notable loss for Congress. Dr. Sushil Gupta, the state president of Aam Aadmi Party, welcomed Lal, marking a strategic shift in the political landscape. This move intensifies the ongoing political tensions in the region. Lal, a prominent figure from Bawal, is expected to strengthen AAP\u2019s position in Haryana, challenging Congress's influence and impacting the dynamics of upcoming elections.
