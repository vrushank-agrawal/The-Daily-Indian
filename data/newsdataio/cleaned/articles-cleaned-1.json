This follows AGEL's announcement, in January 2024, to fully backstop the Holdco Notes through a fully funded redemption reserve account maintained eight months prior to the redemption date to facilitate full redemption of Holdco Notes upon maturity in compliance with applicable guidelines.Issued in September 2021, the three-year Holdco Notes have supported AGEL\u2019s high-growth objectives. During the period, AGEL\u2019s capacity has increased more than threefold \u2014 from 3.5 GW to 11.2 GW, registering a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 48 per cent.AGEL's overall capital management philosophy has remained focused on long-term value creation through asset development and positioned AGEL as a self-propelled growth engine. It also emphasises the structured approach to accomplish credit metrics akin to investment grade profile for its underlying debt capital raise programme.With this, AGEL is committed to having capital market issuances tailored for long-term infra asset class supported through the predictable and robust cashflow stream to attain long curve emulating underlying asset life. Over the years, the Capital Management Plan has matured to allow AGEL to have a 'seasoned' portfolio with a superior operational asset base supporting the under-construction development. With surplus cash from operating assets augmenting the under-construction projects\u2019 requirement, AGEL\u2019s overall capex program remains fully funded with such operational assets cashflows and the available construction facility pool. In addition, AGEL\u2019s promoters had agreed, in December 2023, to subscribe to a preferential warrant amounting to Rs 9,350 crore, out of which, Rs 7,013 crore ($835 million equivalent) shall be available with AGEL to fund any accelerated capital expenditure requirements.AGEL thanks its investors and lenders for their confidence and its vendor partners, including Adani Infra (India) Ltd and Adani Infra Management Services Ltd, for their continuous support in achieving the accelerated growth plan, putting AGEL on track to achieve 50 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.",

        "description": "In an unprecedented move that melds the realms of law enforcement and extraterrestrial enigma, police chiefs from America\u2019s largest metropolises have unveiled a guide addressing Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs). This 11-page compendium, which emerged in June, serves as both a chilling chronicle and a practical manual for officers grappling with the specter of UFO encounters. According to DailyMail, the guide, meticulously crafted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA), cautions that unidentified flying objects \u201cpose significant safety risks to law enforcement air support units,\u201d advocating for heightened vigilance among helicopter crews. The document delves into nerve-wracking real-life incidents, underscoring the urgency for police departments to stay attuned to the unknown threats these aerial anomalies might represent. Among the harrowing narratives included, one from November 2023 stands out: a Blairsville, Georgia officer reported witnessing a \u201ctriangle craft with 3 dim green lights per side\u201d navigating the night sky. \u201cI am a police officer and deputy sheriff. While on duty after dark, near the top of my windshield (frame of view) I witnessed movement in the sky (southbound direction of view),\u201d the officer recounted. Despite his familiarity with conventional aerial traffic, he described the sighting as \u201cunlike anything I had ever witnessed.\u201d The guide\u2019s pages are also punctuated with accounts from other officers who have encountered UFOs while on patrol. In Harper Woods, Michigan, for instance, two officers observed three enigmatic objects in the sky that, as they described, \u201cblinked out\u201d of existence. Their account reads: \u201cAt approximately 6:00am, myself and a fellow officer were standing in a parking lot of a church talking before the end of our shift... The objects appeared to drift towards the east, maintaining the equal distance. As we watched the objects, they appeared to \u2018blink out\u2019 of our vision.\u201d The guide does not shy away from including high-profile testimonies and historical context. It features insights from notable figures such as former United States Air Force officer and intelligence official David Grusch, who in a 2023 congressional hearing, claimed knowledge of aircraft with \u201cnonhuman\u201d origins. Further enriching the guide are civilian reports documenting sightings of police helicopters seemingly pursuing UFOs. An Austin, Texas resident noted, \u201cWhen I walked out front door, saw Triangle Craft\u2014with white lights illuminated on each corner\u2014being closely followed by police helicopter.\u201d Similarly, a Winnipeg, Canada resident described witnessing a police chopper being overtaken by unidentified craft while relaxing in his hot tub. Nigel Watson, author of Captured by Aliens? A History and Analysis of American Abduction Claims, remarked on the guide's utility for law enforcement. He noted, \u201cThe short history of the study of UAPs and the links to organizations where sightings can be reported is very helpful.\u201d However, Watson also critiqued the guide for its reliance on testimonies from former government officials without substantial evidence, and for neglecting skeptical perspectives that could provide a more balanced view.",

        "description": "The Kerala government\u2019s decision to rent a helicopter for Rs 80 lakhs per month has come under scrutiny, as the intended purpose for its use has shifted significantly. Initially, the helicopter was rented for monitoring Maoist movements and conducting relief activities during disasters. However, it is now primarily being used for the chief minister\u2019s travels. While Kerala Thunderbolt soldiers continue to monitor Maoist activities on foot in the forest areas, the helicopter was notably absent during recent relief efforts following the devastating landslides in Wayanad. Instead, it was used solely for the chief minister\u2019s travel to address government officials, raising concerns about its cost-effectiveness and actual utility. The helicopter, rented by the Kerala government from Delhi-based Chipsan Aviation in September 2023, can be used for up to 25 hours per month at a cost of Rs 80 lakhs. For any additional flying hours beyond this limit, an extra charge of Rs 90,000 per hour is applicable. The Kerala government has incurred Rs 9.60 crore in helicopter rent so far, with the contract set for three years, projecting a total liability of Rs 28.80 crore. Critics argue that the state could have purchased its own helicopter for a much lower cost, estimated between Rs 5 crore and Rs 20 crore. The decision to rent a helicopter in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, sparked public outrage. That chopper, rented from Pawan Hans Company at a cost of Rs 22.21 crore, was considered unnecessary and largely unused, leading to the contract\u2019s termination after one year. Despite this, the government made the contentious decision to rent another helicopter in 2023. Allegations have surfaced that the government is funneling money to a private company under the guise of a helicopter rental contract. This luxury comes at a time when the state is grappling with severe financial crises. This publication has previously reported on the state\u2019s dire fiscal situation, where the government struggles to even secure loans to cover welfare pension payments for the elderly. Salaries and pensions for Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) employees remain uncertain, and there is a lack of funds for developmental projects and infrastructure improvements. The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation, established to offer essential goods at affordable prices, now sees few customers due to frequent shortages. New projects are stalled, and existing ones are barely progressing due to insufficient funds. Despite these financial woes, extravagances continue, with numerous high-paying appointments marred by widespread nepotism, leaving the public frustrated.",

This comes months after the June debate between Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden, who later announced an end to his reelection bid and endorsed Harris after facing immense backlash over his lackluster performance and concerns around his age and fitness. Trump has attacked Harris multiple times since her abrupt rise to prominence, primarily on a personal level. Trump is most likely to target Harris on issues, ranging from questioning her race to her views on immigration, taxes, foreign policy, election involvement, etc. Watch this video to know where the two presidential candidates stand on key issues.",
