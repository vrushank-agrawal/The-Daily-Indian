        "description": "The one-off Test between Afghanistan and New Zealand was called off on Friday without a ball being bowled, marking only the eighth time in Test cricket history that such a situation has occurred.The first two days of the game were cancelled because of a wet outfield, raising significant concerns about the preparedness of the Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex. The remaining three days were then washed out due to persistent rain.An inspection was held on Friday morning but with puddles of water still present on the uncovered sections of the outfield, it was a foregone conclusion that the match would be abandoned without even the toss taking place.\"It is still raining in Greater Noida and due to frequent rains, the 5th and final day of the Afghanistan vs New Zealand Test has been called off by the match officials,\" the Afghanistan Cricket Board said in a statement.Only seven matches in the history of Test cricket have been abandoned without a ball being bowled dating back",

        "description": "The French league's legal commission has ordered Paris Saint-Germain to pay Kylian Mbapp the 55 million euros (USD 61 million) in unpaid wages that he claims he's entitled to, the league said Thursday.The league confirmed the decision to The Associated Press without more details, a day after the France superstar rejected a mediation offer by the commission in his dispute with his former club.PSG officials and Mbapp's representatives met in Paris on Wednesday after Mbapp asked the commission to get involved. Mbapp joined Real Madrid this summer on a free transfer.",

How would a team long viewed as over-reliant on the France superstar cope without him after his move to Real Madrid?Who could score so freely for PSG when Mbapp averaged more than 40 goals per season over the past four campaigns and more than 250 in seven years at the club? And, who would bail the team out of trouble with last-gasp winners?Things have turned out rather well, so far, and the widely anticipated post-Mbapp headache has not materialised. Far from it.PSG is the only team to have won its first three games in the French league and has scored an impressive 13 goals.No longer being so reliant on Mbapp seems to have produced an early side effect, whereby the goals are being shared around and teamwork has improved in coach Luis Enrique's side.Bradley Barcola has led the way with four goals, adding a finishing touch to his skilful dribbling down the left, while his France teammate Randal",

        "description": "The United States announced Thursday that it will support the addition of two new permanent seats for African countries on the powerful U.N. Security Council and a first-ever non-permanent seat for a small island developing nation.U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the announcement in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, calling it a follow-up to U.S. President Joe Biden's announcement two years ago that the U.S. supports expanding the 15-member body.While Africa has three non-permanent seats on the Security Council, that doesn't allow African countries to deliver the full benefit of their knowledge and voices, she said.That is why, in addition to non-permanent membership for African countries, the United States supports creating two permanent seats for Africa on the council, Thomas-Greenfield said. It's what our African partners seek, and it's what we believe is just.However, a senior U.S. administration official, who spoke on condition of ...",

The campaign to target Beijing this week shows how curbing China's power has emerged as a rare issue of political consensus.But some measures did pass along party lines, with Republicans arguing the need to protect national security when it comes to everything from education to farmland, and Democrats raising concerns about discrimination. The advocacy group Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote also warned about overly broad anti-China rhetoric.One contentious measure seeks to revive a Trump-era program to root out Beijing's spying in American universities and institutes. The bills all still need ...",
