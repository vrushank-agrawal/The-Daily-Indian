        "description": "International oil prices continue to be extremely volatile, falling on one day and rising thereafter, a top oil ministry official said explaining the reason behind no reduction in petrol and diesel prices despite softening in input cost, but could not say if the rates will be cut before Maharashtra elections.Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures fell below USD 70 per barrel last week -- the first time since December 2021 -- but gained thereafter. Brent was trading at USD 74.58 per barrel on Thursday while West Texas Intermediate advanced to trade at USD 71.71.A decline in price of crude oil -- which is converted into fuels like petrol and diesel at refineries -- had rekindled hopes for a reduction in petrol and diesel rates that have been on a freeze for over two years now barring a pre-election reduction earlier this year.\"Oil prices continue to be volatile. They fell one day last week to below USD 70 but rose the day after,\" the official, speaking on condition of anonymity,",

        "description": "DMK President and Chief Minister M K Stalin on Thursday dubbed the Centre's simultaneous elections proposal impractical, unfeasible, and a 'diversionary' tactic, which the BJP-led regime would never be able to implement.In a post on X, Stalin said: \"#OneNationOneElection is an impractical proposition that ignores the complexities of India's diverse electoral system and undermines federalism. It is logistically unfeasible, given the vast differences in election cycles, regional issues, and governance priorities.It will require an unrealistic alignment of all terms of office, disrupting the natural course of governance.This entire proposal is simply a move to satisfy the BJP's ego, but they will never be able to implement it. India's democracy cannot be bent to suit the greed of one party. Union government should address pressing issues like unemployment, price rise and equitable distribution of resources to States instead of wasting energy on these diversionary tactics.",

        "description": "Nobody knows why Arvind Kejriwal decided to resign as Delhi chief minister and what were his compulsions. If he could run his government from jail, who prevented him from doing the same while living free, out of jail? Let me tell you, Kejriwal is a clever politician and he very well understands the game of perception. He won elections by levelling charges of corruption against top leaders of the country. Now he is himself facing charges of corruption in the liquor scam and this does not suit his style of politics. Kejriwal became chief minister after practically decimating both the Congress and BJP in Delhi elections. He has consistently won assembly elections for his party in Delhi, reduced Congress to a zero and badly marginalized the BJP in the national capital.",
