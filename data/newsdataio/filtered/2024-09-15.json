He showed glimpses of his brilliance in the recently concluded Durand Cup and carried that momentum into the new ISL season.It was a cagey start from both sides with plenty of tackles flying in, mostly to disrupt the momentum.Nandha Kumar was guilty of a mis-timed challenge in the third minute when he brought down Suresh Wangjam. The East Bengal FC winger received a yellow card for his reckless tackle.Despite the caution, tackles kept flying as Lalchungnunga and later Hector Yuste also joined Nandha into the referee's book.The first real opportunity of the game came when Jeakson Singh collected a loose ball outside the penalty area.

First, Connor Shields saw an effort blocked midway through the half before Farukh shot wide from close range.Samik prevented Odisha from going 2-0 up with a superb last-ditch save after Hnamte rattled the upright with an outstanding free-kick.The Marina Machans were .",
